%% This note is designed to be dragged into the left side panel and assumes you are using DnD5e Notes created by the [CLI Process](https://obsidianttrpgtutorials.com/Obsidian+TTRPG+Tutorials/Plugin+Tutorials/TTRPG-Convert-CLI/TTRPG-Convert-CLI+5e). This creates a simple icon that can be used to quickly access links to commonly used rules. Add to this with whatever you need. You need to use the xphb book source for this to work. %%
