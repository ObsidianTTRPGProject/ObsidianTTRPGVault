# Healer
## Overview
You are an able physician, allowing you to mend wounds quickly and get your allies back in the fight. You gain the following benefits:

## Effects
- When you use a [[Healer's Kit|healer’s kit]] to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains 1 hit point.
- As an action, you can spend one use of a [[Healer's Kit|healer’s kit]] to tend to a creature and restore 1d6 + 4 hit points to it, plus additional hit points equal to the creature’s maximum number of Hit Dice. The creature can’t regain hit points from this feat again until it finishes a short or long rest.
