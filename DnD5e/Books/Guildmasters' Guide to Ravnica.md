# Welcome to Ravnica
![[000-intro01.jpg|right|300]]

From the back of her soaring roc, a sky knight surveys the spire-studded cityscape below. As the morning fog dissipates under the chill autumn sun, the city spreads out as far as she can see: lofty cathedrals, squat courthouses, towering apartments, sprawling tenements, cobblestone plazas, and broken ruins where once-majestic buildings have crumbled to rubble. She imagines the teeming masses below her: humans, elves, vedalken, minotaurs, goblins, loxodons, and other peoples, as some of them rise to greet the morning and others retire after a hard night of work or play. They are the reason she is here: sworn to protect them, she leads a flight of roc riders toward the fires raging in Precinct Three. Soldiers on the ground will put out the flames, while it's her job to deal with their source: the dragon she can just make out, clinging to the spire of a distant tower. Standing in her stirrups and raising her sword, she turns her mount toward the dragon, ready to battle once again for the sake of Ravnica.

Ravnica is a whole new world for your Dungeons & Dragons campaign to explore. A vast, sprawling city that covers the whole of the known world, Ravnica teems with intrigue and adventure, driven by the conflicts among the ten powerful guilds that rule the city.

Ravnica originally appeared as a setting for the Magic: The Gathering trading card game. It has been the subject of eight card sets: 2005–6's *Ravnica: City of Guilds*, *Guildpact*, and *Dissension*; 2012–13's *Return to Ravnica*, *Gatecrash*, and *Dragon's Maze*; and 2018–19's *Guilds of Ravnica* and *Ravnica Allegiance*. Among fans of Magic, Ravnica is one of the most popular settings, in part because the world's ten guilds strongly support the way players build Magic decks.

As it turns out, Ravnica's ten guilds also provide a great framework for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. They offer character archetypes, competing factions that player characters can join, and abundant opportunities to develop and drive a campaign driven by the guilds' schemes and interactions.

This book, then, is your point of entry into Ravnica as a setting for your D&D campaign. It guides you through the process of creating characters and adventures set here.

Chapter 1 is all about building characters. It offers new race and class options, reflecting the unique character of Ravnica as a Magic setting, and the creatures and characters seen on Magic cards. You can also use this material in any other D&D setting.

Race and class are only the skeleton of a character, though, and chapter 2 is aimed at helping you add flesh to those bones in order to make a character who is an integrated part of Ravnica's tapestry of guilds. The ten guilds are detailed in chapter 2, and each section includes a background that reflects a character's membership in the guild. This chapter also describes opportunities for characters to advance in rank and position within their guilds by acquiring renown.

The focus of chapter 3 is on the city itself—and particularly on the Tenth District, which is the heart of Ravnica. The important precincts and neighborhoods of the district are described in broad overview, allowing you, as DM, plenty of leeway for developing the specifics of places and NPCs.

Chapter 4 is all about adventures in Ravnica, expanding on the material in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* with hundreds of seeds that can grow into full-fledged adventures in the fertile ground of a DM's imagination. This chapter also includes a short starting adventure you can use to launch a Ravnica campaign.

Chapter 5 includes magic items and other treasures for use as rewards in a Ravnica campaign. Many of these magic items are D&D interpretations of specific Magic artifact cards—not literal translations of their mechanics from one rules system to the other, but game elements inspired by the flavor and abilities of the cards.

Chapter 6 presents new monsters and NPCs, again reflecting the creatures seen on Magic cards as well as the nature of each guild. The guildmaster of each guild is detailed in this chapter, as are a variety of guild members.

## City of Guilds
In all their fantastic diversity, the cosmopolitan citizens of Ravnica go about their daily business in bustling markets and shadowy back alleys. Shambling pack animals (mammals, reptiles, insects, and bizarre hybrids alike) carry their loads through the streets, while untamed wild things lurk in verdant greenbelts, rubble-strewn ruins, and sewers. And interwoven throughout it all, ten guilds vie for power, wealth, and influence:

**Azorius Senate**. The Azorius Senate functions as the government of Ravnica, built on the three columns of a legislative, a judicial, and an executive branch under the leadership of **Isperia**, the sphinx Supreme Judge.

**Boros Legion**. Led by the angel **Aurelia**, the Boros Legion pursues the cause of justice, not merely law enforcement. Boros serves as Ravnica's standing army.

**House Dimir**. House Dimir is in the business of information, operating an espionage organization behind a facade of messengers, investigators, and archivists. Its enigmatic leader, **Lazav**, wears many faces.

**Golgari Swarm**. An elf lich named Jarad guides the Golgari Swarm's masses as they lurk in the undercity, where they process the city's waste and see to the new life that emerges from death and decay.

**Gruul Clans**. Raging against civilization and its defilement of the natural world, the loose alliance of the Gruul Clans is led by the cyclops **Borborygmos**.

**Izzet League**. Led by the dragon **Niv-Mizzet**, the Izzet League is a guild of scientists and engineers who build and sustain Ravnica's infrastructure while conducting wild experiments in magic—efforts that usually involve barely controlled elemental energy.

**Orzhov Syndicate**. A sinister combination of church, bank, and organized crime syndicate, the Orzhov Syndicate is controlled by the Obzedat, a cabal of ancient spirits often called the Ghost Council.

**Cult of Rakdos**. The demonic Cult of **Rakdos** is the jester in Ravnica's culture, using satire and performance to skewer the powerful and embolden the weak. But it is a cruel and bloodthirsty jester, in the manner of its demonic leader, and it supplements parody and levity with blood and fire.

**Selesnya Conclave**. The Selesnya Conclave is led by **Trostani**, three dryads who are fused together with one another and with Mat'Selesnya, a manifestation of the soul of the world. The guild seeks to bring nature and the city into balance.

**Simic Combine**. Under the leadership of Prime Speaker **Zegana**, the biomancers of the Simic Combine apply magic to the life sciences. Striving to create a harmonious future where creatures of all kinds are perfectly adapted to their ever-changing environment, the Simic magically hasten the process of evolution and adaptation of life.

These ten guilds stand as the foundation of power on Ravnica. Each maintains a distinctive identity and civic function, a diverse collection of creatures, and a subculture of its own. The guilds' history is a web of wars, intrigue, and political machinations stretching over the millennia during which they have vied for control of the world. Their roles were established thousands of years ago in a magical treaty called the Guildpact, which not only assigned each guild a function, but also enforced an uneasy peace among them.

## History of Ravnica
More than ten thousand years ago, a war tore across the world of Ravnica. Ten armies battled for control of the world in a conflict that ended with the creation of a magical contract of immense power known as the Guildpact. The leaders of each of the ten armies—ancient beings known as paruns—were the signatories to the Guildpact, and they became the first guildmasters of Ravnica.

The text of the Guildpact spelled out specific roles for each guild within the infrastructure of Ravnica, allowing the city to grow while the guilds coexisted in relative peace. But the true power of the Guildpact was the strength of its magically binding force, which absolutely prevented large-scale violence among the guilds.

For ten millennia, the city grew and flourished under this structure as the guilds evolved into unique and powerful forces, often venturing far from their original purpose.

The signing of the Guildpact marked the beginning of the modern Ravnican calendar. Years prior to that pivotal event are denoted as "Al Concordant," or AC, and counted backward from 1 AC. Years after the signing are "Zal Concordant," ZC. The current date is 10,076 ZC, usually referred to as '76.

### The Guildpact
During the Decamillennial Celebration of 10,000 ZC, commemorating a monumental anniversary of the Guildpact's signing, the pact was broken, the ancient balance was shattered, and Ravnica was thrown into chaos. It didn't take long for wealthy power-mongers to begin seizing control of elements in the city, turning the guilds to their service instead of the other way around. Eventually, the ten-thousand-year-old guild culture and division of duties reasserted itself. The ten guilds regained their dominant positions, but without the magically binding force of the Guildpact to maintain the balance among them.

Years later, in 10,075 ZC, the Izzet guildmaster discovered that Azor, founder of the Azorius Senate, had created a contingency plan that would take effect if the magic of the Guildpact were ever broken. An intricate network of ley lines sprawling across the districts of Ravnica, called the Implicit Maze, offered a test to the guilds: if they could cooperate to solve the maze, they would secure the power of a new Guildpact. That power was eventually bestowed—incarnated, actually—in the person of Jace Beleren, who became the Living Guildpact. His word became the binding law of Ravnica. Any law he verbally confirmed became magically unbreakable, and the responsibility of keeping the guilds in balance fell to him.

### A Precarious Peace
Jace is a Planeswalker, with the ability to travel from world to world, and his attention never remains focused on Ravnica for long. Thanks to his involvement with other Planeswalkers, he spends extended periods of time away from Ravnica. During his absences, Ravnica has to fend for itself, and that means that the guilds return to their old habits of fighting with each other over the smallest scraps of influence that could tilt the balance of power in their favor.

These conflicts erupt in a variety of forms. Sometimes guilds clash violently in the streets: Boros forces try to quell Gruul riots, Azorius arresters raid a **Rakdos** murder show, or Selesnya forces come together to repel a Golgari incursion. More often, sinister plots unfold in secret, through infiltration, sabotage, theft, and deception. Schemes are hidden beneath layers of other schemes, making the intention behind them nearly impossible to discover. The guildmasters are often the source of these plots, but sometimes subordinates attack other guilds to gain more influence within their own. In the absence of the Guildpact, some people believe that it's only a matter of time until these schemes and skirmishes escalate into all-out war on a scale that Ravnica hasn't known for ten millennia.

With the precarious peace always hanging in the balance, opportunities abound for adventurers to serve their guilds or advance their own agendas. Whether delving into the dungeons of the undercity, pursuing assassins through the bustling streets, negotiating accords among the rich and powerful, or sniffing out corruption in the halls of law, the characters in a Ravnica campaign have a world of adventure to explore.

> ##### Ravnica's Calendar
>Ravnica's year of 365 days is made up of twelve months, each of which has the same number of days as its counterpart in the Gregorian calendar. The year begins with 1 Seleszeni, which corresponds to March 1.

The annual celebration of the Guildpact begins on 28 Zuun and extends overnight into 1 Seleszeni.

## Life in the Big City
Ravnica is a vast city, covering the entirety of the world in many layers of construction, from deep sewers and catacombs to sky-raking spires. No single map can encompass the tremendous scope of its sprawl, and its borders (if it has any) are unknown, except possibly to those who live near the edges.

The story of Ravnica focuses on its core. Sometimes called the city proper, this core is divided into ten districts, each of which is a huge urban environment in its own right. The districts are named in simple numerical order from the First to the Tenth. No correlation exists between the ten guilds and the ten districts; all ten guilds are active in all ten districts. The Tenth District, in particular, is a hotbed of activity where all the guilds maintain their primary headquarters. It is the focus of chapter 3.

A huge avenue called the Transguild Promenade runs through all ten districts, making it the most notable landmark for navigation through the city's heart. Lined with markets, small parks, and colonnades, the Promenade is a commercial thoroughfare used to transport loads of cargo. On celebration days, it becomes the city's most popular parade route. Even when guild conflicts run hot, Ravnicans respect the sanctity of the Promenade as neutral ground.

Beyond the core are an uncounted number of other districts, which originated as outlying cities that gradually melded into the expanding metropolis. Well-known districts outside the core include the Smelting District, Irbitov (the mausoleum district), and Jezeru (the lake district).

Districts, whether in the city proper or beyond it, are the fundamental configurations that define Ravnica. They are informally divided into various quarters, neighborhoods, and the like. Some of these areas extend across district boundaries. Deadbridge, for example, existed as a well-defined neighborhood before Ravnica City was formally divided into ten districts, and that division was made without consideration of Deadbridge's informally acknowledged boundaries. Part of Deadbridge, known as Deadbridge Chasm, occupies much of the Tenth District's Precinct Six, but it extends out into the neighboring area. Similar neighborhoods, both within and outside the city proper, include the Steambath Quarter, the Wrights' Quarter, and Mahovna, the Haven of Moss.

> ##### Guild Insignia
>Members of Ravnica's guilds typically carry guild insignia with them, though in some cases (notably House Dimir) the insignia might be carefully hidden. A replacement insignia costs 5 gp and is available only to members of the guild. Any character can use the insignia of their guild as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook*.
>

### Currency: Zibs and Zinos
This book uses standard D&D coinage, as detailed in the *Player's Handbook*, but in Ravnica, citizens refer to their money as zibs and zinos, with 100 zibs to 1 zino. There is no central mint, as coins are created by the Azorius, the Boros, and the Orzhov. The Ravnica Currency table summarizes the various guilds' coinage and its value.

##### Ravnica Currency
| Value | Azorius | Boros | Orzhov |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| 1 cp | copper zib | — | copper alms-coin |
| 25 cp | silver 25-zib coin | — | — |
| 1 ep | electrum 50-zib coin | — | — |
| 1 gp | gold zino | gold zino | — |
| 5 gp | — | gold 5-zino coin | — |
| 1 pp | — | — | platinum 10-zino coin |
| 10 pp | — | — | platinum 100-zino coin |

### Comforts of Civilization
A mixture of technological advancement and sophisticated magic offers amenities to the people of Ravnica that would be extraordinary to folk in most D&D worlds, except one like Eberron. The nicer neighborhoods of the city enjoy central heating and plumbing (thanks to the work of the Izzet League), elevators, and spacious apartments. Even poorer neighborhoods boast clean and smooth roads and sturdy construction. No one needs to go hungry in Ravnica, because the Golgari Swarm provides a bare minimum of sustenance to anyone who can't afford better food, though it is best not to think too much about where the thick gruel comes from. (In practical terms, even a character who can't afford more than a wretched lifestyle doesn't need to go hungry.)

The citizens of Ravnica enjoy plenty of leisure time, and the city offers an abundance of ways to fill it. Ravnica features restaurants with extensive collections of fine wines, cafés serving coffee and tea, street vendors offering portable meals, and bakeries that sell a wide variety of breads and pastries. Travelers can stay in luxury hotels or simple hostels, or they can rely on their personal or guild-related contacts to find housing. Diversions and entertainments abound, including raucous street-side theater (including the circus-like spectacles of the Cult of **Rakdos**), operas and symphonies, illegal fight clubs, sporting events held in vast arenas, throwaway popular novels, and great works of literature. These things are shared by the city's diverse peoples, who enjoy a life adorned by a variety of species, gender identities, and sexual orientations.

Well-established systems undergird society, largely through the efforts of the guilds. The Azorius Senate crafts, codifies, and enforces a comprehensive (some would say oppressive) set of laws. The banks of the Orzhov Syndicate offer secure vaults and complicated financial arrangements. The Izzet League maintains the city's infrastructure, and the Golgari Swarm ensures that waste is disposed of (or recycled). House Dimir couriers deliver messages and parcels across the city, and the Simic Combine addresses issues of public health.

Ravnica lacks any large-scale agriculture operations, its citizens depending on food produced in Selesnya gardens and underground Golgari rot farms. Few parts of Ravnica could be considered wilderness; the rubblebelts, areas where the city has decayed and been reclaimed by natural forces, are the only truly wild areas.

##### Cosmopolitan Conveniences
| Item | Cost |
|---|---:|
| Cup of coffee | 10 cp |
| Newspaper | 15 cp |
| Pendulum clock | 100–250 gp |
| Spectacles | 25 gp |
| Spyglass | 50–100 gp |

### Languages
Dozens of languages can be heard in any of Ravnica's marketplaces, and every tongue has dialects and regional variations. In order for the guilds to function, the Common language is essential. But other languages remain widely used in homes and clan gatherings.

##### Standard Languages
| Language | Typical Speakers | Script |
|---|---|---|
| Abyssal | Demons, devils | Infernal |
| Celestial | Angels | Celestial |
| Common | Humans | Common |
| Draconic | Dragons | Draconic |
| Elvish | Elves | Elvish |
| Giant | Ogres, giants | Minotaur |
| Goblin | Goblins | Common |
| Kraul | Kraul | Kraul |
| Loxodon | Loxodons | Elvish |
| Merfolk | Merfolk | Merfolk |
| Minotaur | Minotaurs | Minotaur |
| Sphinx | Sphinxes | — |
| Sylvan | Centaurs, dryads | Elvish |
| Vedalken | Vedalken | Vedalken |

A few secret or exotic languages are used on Ravnica as well. Druidic exists and allows a secret communication among druids in different guilds, such as Selesnya and Golgari, but such communication is rare. Thieves' cant is widely used among street gangs and occasionally among rogues in House Dimir and the Golgari Swarm.

# Chapter 1: Character Creation
![[000-c101.jpg|right|300]]

The *Player's Handbook* describes a step-by-step process of character creation. When you create a character for a Ravnica campaign, you'll go through the same steps, with the added step of choosing a guild.

Creating a character begins with imagining the person you want to play. The ten guilds of Ravnica provide a way to jump-start your imagination and steer you toward certain character archetypes that can guide the rest of the decisions you make for your character.

## Choosing a Guild
*Chapter 2* describes the ten guilds of Ravnica in detail. How do you decide what guild you want your character to belong to? You can choose one of these approaches:

- Look at the questionnaire, "What's Important to Me?", in this chapter. Let its questions and your choice of answers direct you to a guild that appeals to you or that sounds like a fun character to play.
- Read the guild descriptions in *chapter 2* and choose one that appeals to you.
- Read the descriptions of races and classes in this chapter. Guild membership recommendations are provided for each race and class, should one catch your eye.
- If you have access to Magic: The Gathering cards from a Ravnica set, find a card that appeals to you and build that character.
- If you're a Magic player and you already have a favorite guild, create a character from that guild.

To reflect your character's membership in a guild, you can choose the background included in the guild's description instead of a background from the *Player's Handbook* or some other source. Also make a note of your contacts.

#### Guildless Characters
You can play a character who isn't a member of a guild. Choose one of the character backgrounds in the *Player's Handbook* or another source instead of one of the guild backgrounds in *chapter 2*. Your guildless character can be of any class, race, and alignment. At the DM's option, you might have contacts within guilds, or the DM can invent contacts for you that aren't associated with the guilds of Ravnica in any way.

If you want your character to join a guild at a later time, the same guidelines apply as if the person were changing guilds, as described in *chapter 2*.

### Race and Class
Each guild description in *chapter 2* provides suggested races and classes for characters belonging to that guild. Some races have strong traditions that direct them toward certain guilds, but exceptions exist. If you choose a class or a race that's not typical for your guild, you might have trouble finding a role in the guild—or, more accurately, your superiors might have trouble figuring out what to do with you—but that challenge can be an interesting facet of your character's development. An atypical choice can also motivate your character to adventure independently from the guild.

This chapter describes new races you can choose from: centaurs, goblins, loxodons, minotaurs, Simic hybrids, and vedalken. It also presents two new subclass options: the cleric's Order Domain and the druid's Circle of Spores. Every subclass in the *Player's Handbook* also receives a mention in this chapter, indicating the guilds where characters of those subclasses might find a home.

Once you've chosen your race and class and recorded the benefits you get from them, you can proceed with the remaining steps of character creation as described in the *Player's Handbook*.

### Building a Party
It's possible to put together a diverse party of D&D characters drawn from a single guild. The guild descriptions in *chapter 2* offer suggestions for what such a party might look like. Conversely, your party can include members of different guilds united by alliances or common principles. Or they could be childhood friends who ended up in different guilds, or just a haphazard collection of individuals thrown together by unforeseen circumstances. The Party Makeup table in this section offers suggestions for how you might compose your party.

The tables of contacts in *chapter 2* can also help you create connections among the characters in your party. Those tables describe family relationships, current and former romantic connections, random acquaintances, past rivals, and many other ties that form among people in different guilds. Let these tables inspire you as you think about the circumstances that bring your party together.

Although conflicts among the guilds drive much of the action in a Ravnica campaign, it's important not to let that tension cause too much friction in a party of adventurers. The D&D game relies on cooperation among the players, so it's helpful for the player characters to find common ground that unites them despite their differences in guild affiliation, ideals, and agendas. Even though some guild leaders (especially the villainous ones) might talk about exterminating or dominating other guilds, many guild members have family, lovers, friends, and acquaintances among other guilds. Those positive associations can bind an adventuring party together.

The DM can also use the Common Cause table in this section to find a way to bring together characters who don't know or trust each other.

##### Party Makeup
| d8 | Party Makeup |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **One-Guild Party**. Choose a guild and refer to its description in *chapter 2* for suggestions on building the party around it. |

| 3 | **Sudden Danger**. The characters are trapped together by a sinkhole opening, a building collapsing, or a laboratory exploding. |
| 4 | **Dream Team**. A strange dream leads each character to the same destination. |
| 5 | **Lost Together**. The characters are hopelessly lost in an unfamiliar part of the city. |
| 6 | **Detente**. By order of their guilds' leaders, the characters must cooperate to complete a secret mission. |
| 7 | **Common Foe**. A villain is a common enemy to all the characters. |
| 8 | **Do or Die**. The characters are all trying to avert the catastrophe of an all-out war among the guilds. |

![[001-c102.png|right|300]]

## Races
The people of Ravnica include members of many different races. Aside from humans, elves, and a smattering of half-elves, the races from the *Player's Handbook* are unknown on Ravnica, unless they're visiting from other worlds.

This chapter provides information about the following common races of Ravnica, as well as racial traits for all of them but humans and elves:

- **Humans** on Ravnica are like those found on other D&D worlds: adaptable, ambitious, and wildly diverse.
- **Elves,** in their three common subraces, are strongly associated with nature.
- **Centaurs,** the quintessential merging of human and horse, savor freedom and champion nature's cause.
- **Goblins** are small, fierce, stealthy, and sometimes comical.
- **Loxodons** resemble humanoid elephants with powerful bodies, stoic natures, and serene wisdom.
- **Minotaurs** on Ravnica are sophisticated tacticians as well as strong and fierce warriors.
- **Simic hybrid** are the results of the Simic Combine's Guardian Project, which magically infuses the adaptive qualities of certain animal species into human, elf, or vedalken volunteers.
- **Vedalken** are tall, blue-skinned, and ingenious, with insatiable curiosity and a penchant for invention.

### Height and Weight
You can roll for your character's height and weight on the Random Height and Weight table. See the *Player's Handbook* for humans, elves, and half-elves.

##### Random Height and Weight
| Race | Base Height | Height Modifier | Base Weight | Weight Modifier |
| Centaur | 6'0" | +1d10 | 600 lb. | × (2d12) lb. |
| Goblin | 3'5" | +2d4 | 35 lb. | × 1 lb. |
| Simic hybrid | * | * | * | * |
| Loxodon | 6'7" | +2d10 | 295 lb. | × (2d4) lb. |
| Minotaur | 5'4" | +2d8 | 175 lb. | × (2d6) lb. |
| Vedalken | 5'4" | +2d10 | 110 lb. | × (2d4) lb. |
* As humanoid base option
Height = Base Height + Height Modifier in inches

Weight = (Base Weight + Height Modifier in pounds) × Weight Modifier

### Human
Humans are a scant majority among the peoples of Ravnica, dominating some guilds and barely represented in others. As on other worlds, they are innovators, achievers, and pioneers whose daring and adaptability make them capable of great things—and great falls.

Not one of the paruns of the ten guilds was human, although the Ghost Council of the Orzhov Syndicate is of human origin. Likewise, no current guildmaster is human. But humans are lieutenants, advisors, and strategists in many guilds. Their ambition and drive propel them toward the top, but the sheer might of beings such as ancient dragons, sphinxes, and demons keeps humans one rung down from the pinnacle of power.

The humans of Ravnica are no less physically diverse than those of other worlds. Similarly, they are varied in their inclinations: they alone are found in every guild.

#### Human Names
One particular human tongue has triumphed over all others to become Ravnica's Common language, and its phonemes and traditions shape the names of most of Ravnica's humans. Humans sometimes borrow names from other races, but they have a rich pool of traditional names to draw from.

The use of family names seems to be a peculiarly human custom. Family names are passed down to children from either parent, and sometimes children use the family names of both their parents. For example, Micyl Savod Zunich was the son of Fonn Zunich and **Jarad Vod Savo**. When other races use family names, they are usually derived from some connection (not necessarily a blood tie) to a human family.

- **Male Human Names:** Agmand, Agosto, Bell, Brev, Dars, Dobromir, Dravin, Evern, Gorev, Ivos, Janik, Juri, Lannos, Lucian, Micas, Nikos, Obez, Olrik, Osidar, Rogad, Sergiu, Sirislav, Tibor, Trigori, Tzaric, Uzric, Valen, Vennick, Vict, Vorimir, Vuliev, Zunak
- **Female Human Names:** Anksa, Aszala, Berta, Bori, Briska, Dahlya, Geetra, Izolda, Jozica, Lavinia, Luda, Lyzolda, Milana, Miotri, Nefara, Palla, Pel, Ruba, Strava, Sulli, Vina, Voka, Zija
- **Family Names:** Andon, Bara, Bejiri, Borca, Capobar, Forenzad, Gerava, Gharti, Golozar, Gostok, Grezar, Helsk, Javya, Karlaus, Kirescu, Koba, Kos, Macav, Migellic, Nar, Nodov, Pelerine, Pijha, Ralinu, Ringor, Rokiric, Sarv, Shonn, Suszat, Tandris, Trul, Tylver, Valenco, Vay, Vinloskarga, Wenslauv, Yaszen

### Elf
![[002-c104.png|right|300]]

The elves of Ravnica are as much at home in the markets of Ivy Lane and the inns of Oak Street as their kin on other worlds are in ancient forests and fey castles. They scale the spires of cathedrals and meditate in gardens and greenbelts. They are part of the city, contributing to its vibrant life and sprawling growth while ensuring it never strays too far from its roots in the earth.

Elves are associated with the principles and magic of nature, growth, and stability. Striving to live in harmony with both nature and the community of Ravnica, they are drawn to guilds that share those ideals, particularly Selesnya, Golgari, and Simic. The Gruul Clans revere nature but set themselves in opposition to civilization, so they don't hold much appeal for the typical elf.

Ravnica's elves don't share the unearthly, haunting presence of their kin on other worlds, perhaps because of the extent to which the city has rubbed off on them. They can easily be mistaken for human from certain angles, particularly if their long, pointed ears and their delicate facial features aren't apparent.

#### Elf Subraces
As on other D&D worlds, Ravnica's elves can be categorized as high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, though there is little physical difference among the three subraces here. Elves share the traits described in the *Player's Handbook* for their race and subrace.

***High Elves.*** The high elves of Ravnica have been subsumed into the Simic Combine and have lost their original tribal name. They are more slender than other elves, and they tend to have angular features and pale skin that often verges toward greenish hues.

***Wood Elves.*** The wood elves of Ravnica, called the Silhana, are strongly associated with the Selesnya Conclave. Most guildless elves can also trace their ancestry to the Silhana. Their coloration covers the whole human range, and sometimes extends to green- or copper-colored hair.

***Dark Elves.*** The word "drow" isn't used on Ravnica, but the Devkarin elves are sometimes called the elves of shadow. They are closely connected to the Golgari Swarm, and because they generally live underground, they share other dark elves' sensitivity to sunlight. Unlike the drow of other worlds, their coloration is much the same as that of wood elves, though their hair is usually dark brown or black.

#### Elf Names
If the tradition of using child names for young elves, as described in the *Player's Handbook***, was ever practiced on Ravnica, it has long since died out. Some traditional Elvish names remain in use, often modified by the influence of human names. Most elves don't use family names.

- **Male Names:** Alcarus, Aramin, Beryan, Carric, Ezoc, Gurras, Immeral, Jarad, Laucian, Mihas, Mandor, Molander, Peren, Suniel, Theren, Varis
- **Female Names:** Arin, Bethrynna, Cevraya, Dainya, Drusilia, Elga, Emmara, Fonn, Ielenya, Iveta, Karissa, Kirce, Meriele, Nayine, Niszka, Svania, Veszka, Yeva

## Classes by Guild
Your character can have any class that appears in the *Player's Handbook* (or other sources, with your DM's permission). Certain classes and subclasses are especially appropriate for particular guilds, reflecting the traditions and training of those guilds. This section can help you choose a guild if you already know what class you want to play.

### Barbarian
If you want to play a barbarian, your most likely guild home is the Gruul Clans, but you could also put your rage to work in the wild spectacles of the Cult of **Rakdos**.

Gruul barbarians of the Zhur-Taa clan often choose the path of the Totem Warrior and a boar totem spirit. The effects are the same as for a bear spirit.

##### Barbarian
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| Path of the Ancestral Guardian* | Gruul |
| Path of the Berserker | Gruul, **Rakdos** |
| Path of the Storm Herald* | Gruul |
| Path of the Totem Warrior | Gruul |
| Path of the Zealot* | Boros, **Rakdos** |
* Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

### Bard
In Ravnica, bards are commonly found among the Azorius Senate, the Cult of **Rakdos**, and the Selesnya Conclave, serving in a variety of capacities as lore keepers and entertainers.

##### Bard
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| College of Glamour* | Selesnya |
| College of Lore | Azorius, Selesnya |
| College of Swords* | **Rakdos** |
| College of Valor | **Rakdos** |
| College of Whispers* | Dimir |
* Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

### Cleric
Though the worship of gods isn't widespread in Ravnica, clerics dedicated to more abstract principles do exist, primarily within the Azorius Senate, the Boros Legion, the Gruul Clans, the Orzhov Syndicate, and the Selesnya Conclave. They most often use their guild insignia as holy symbols.

##### Cleric
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| Forge Domain* | Boros |
| Knowledge Domain | Azorius |
| Life Domain | Boros, Selesnya |
| Light Domain | Boros |

![[010-c111.png|right|300]]

### Druid
Druid characters are typically associated with the Golgari Swarm, the Gruul Clans, the Selesnya Conclave, and the Simic Combine. Druid circles do not cross guild boundaries; the fact that a Golgari druid and a Selesnya druid both belong to the Circle of the Land does not necessarily create common ground between them.

##### Druid
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| Circle of Dreams* | Selesnya |
| Circle of Spores** | Golgari |
| Circle of the Land | Golgari (forest, swamp, Underdark), Selesnya (forest, grassland), Simic (coast, forest) |
| Circle of the Moon | Gruul |
| Circle of the Shepherd* | Selesnya |
* Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*** Appears in this chapter

### Fighter
Fighters are common in almost every guild, with Dimir as the notable exception. In a world where constant tension among the guilds often blooms into physical violence, fighters are the core of most guilds' defenses.

##### Fighter
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| Arcane Archer* | Selesnya |
| Battle Master | Azorius, Boros, Orzhov, Selesnya |
| Cavalier* | Azorius, Boros |
| Champion | Azorius, Boros, Golgari, Gruul, Orzhov, **Rakdos**, Selesnya, Simic |
| Eldritch Knight | Azorius, Boros, Izzet, **Rakdos** |
* Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

### Monk
Unarmed fighting styles like those practiced by monks are uncommon on Ravnica, but a few guilds—House Dimir, the Selesnya Conclave, and the Simic Combine—do have contemplative traditions that include channeling magic in the form of ki.

##### Monk
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| Way of Shadow | Dimir |
| Way of the Four Elements | Simic (focus on water- and air-related disciplines) |
| Way of the Open Hand | Selesnya, Simic |
| Way of the Sun Soul* | Boros |
* Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

### Paladin
The loyalty of a paladin is appreciated most by those guilds that value oaths of service, namely the Azorius Senate, the Boros Legion, and the Selesnya Conclave.

##### Paladin
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| Oath of Conquest* | Orzhov |
| Oath of Devotion | Boros |
| Oath of Redemption* | Selesnya |
| Oath of the Ancients | Selesnya |
| Oath of Vengeance | Azorius |

*Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

![[011-c112.png|right|300]]

### Ranger
Standing as a bastion between civilization and the wilderness, Boros rangers scout the rubblebelts and other wild areas of Ravnica. Gruul rangers serve a similar role, though they are focused on protecting their clans from the encroachment of civilized forces such as the Boros. Selesnya and Golgari rangers are focused on protecting their communities.

##### Ranger
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| Beast Master | Golgari (prefer insects and reptiles), Gruul (prefer fierce beasts), Selesnya (prefer wolves) |
| Gloom Stalker* | Golgari |
| Hunter | Boros, Gruul, Selesnya |
* Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

### Rogue
Rogues are most at home in House Dimir, the Golgari Swarm, and the Orzhov Syndicate.

##### Rogue
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| Arcane Trickster | Dimir |
| Assassin | Dimir, Golgari, Orzhov |
| Inquisitive* | Azorius, Dimir |
| Mastermind* | Dimir |
| Scout* | Gruul |
| Swashbuckler* | **Rakdos** |
| Thief | Dimir, Golgari, Orzhov, **Rakdos** |

*Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

### Sorcerer
Ravnica's sorcerers usually attribute their magical power not to bloodlines or cosmic forces, but to laboratory experiments—often ones gone awry. Thus, they are most often found among the Izzet.

**Niv-Mizzet**, the guildmaster of the Izzet, is a dragon. Sorcerers who gain their elemental powers from laboratory incidents often claim that they have been infused with some of **Niv-Mizzet**'s power.

##### Sorcerer
| Subclass | Guild |

| Divine Soul* | Boros |
| Draconic Bloodline | Izzet |
| Shadow Magic* | Dimir |
| Storm Sorcery* | Izzet |
| Wild Magic | Izzet |
* Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

### Warlock
In a handful of guilds, service to a powerful individual is common among warlocks. Warlocks are most often found in the Cult of **Rakdos** and the Selesnya Conclave.

Members of any guild who delve too deeply into forbidden secrets—perhaps at the behest of their guilds' leaders, or sometimes in defiance of them—might unearth lore regarding the "old gods" of Ravnica. These mysterious beings, called the Nephilim, grant warlocks the mysterious and maddening powers of the Great Old One.

| The Archfey | Selesnya |
| The Celestial* | Boros |
| The Fiend | **Rakdos** |
| The Great Old One | Any |
* Appears in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

### Wizard
Almost every guild has wizards. Noteworthy exceptions include the Gruul Clans, the Cult of **Rakdos**, and the Selesnya Conclave, which are built around devotion to ancient ways and powerful beings.

##### Wizard
| Subclass | Guild |
|---|---|
| School of Abjuration | Azorius, Orzhov |

## Subclass Options
Two classes receive subclass options in this section: the cleric and the druid.

At 1st level, a cleric chooses a Divine Domain. This source adds the Order Domain to the options available to the cleric making that choice.

At 2nd level, a druid chooses a Druid Circle. This source adds the Circle of Spores to the options available to the druid making that choice.

# Chapter 2: Guilds of Ravnica
![[014-201.jpg|right|300]]

The ten guilds are the lifeblood of Ravnica, making up the foundation of its society. They are voluntary associations led by guildmasters, but that's the extent of their resemblance to the craft and merchant guilds found on most Dungeons & Dragons worlds. They include many different kinds of organizations:

- A government body, the Azorius Senate
- A military force, the Boros Legion
- An espionage network, House Dimir
- An association of raiders, the Gruul Clans
- Two scientific research institutions, the Izzet League and the Simic Combine
- An organized crime family, the Orzhov Syndicate
- Raucous performance troupes collectively known as the Cult of **Rakdos**, which bends to the whims of a powerful demon
- Two widely divergent groups devoted to nature, the Golgari Swarm and the Selesnya Conclave

Citizens of Ravnica aren't born into guilds. An individual can choose to belong to any guild—or no guild. Some guilds, such as Selesnya and Boros, actively recruit new members, while others simply accept those who seek membership. People within a family might join different guilds, which can lead to strong connections between the guilds in question or to painful animosity in families whose members follow different paths.

Even though citizens can choose their guild associations, long-standing traditions steer certain individuals toward a particular guild. For example, it would be highly unusual for a Devkarin elf (a dark elf) to join any guild other than the Golgari, and the Ordruun line of minotaurs has provided the Boros armies with generations of offspring. Members of certain races are also drawn to specific guilds, as noted in the description of each of guild.

### Guild Membership
You establish your character's membership in a guild by choosing that guild's background from among those detailed in this chapter. This book assumes that you have chosen a guild and that you maintain your association with it throughout your life. As a result, your choice of guild can play a more significant role than most backgrounds do in shaping what your character does now, not just what you accomplished in the past.

The backgrounds associated with guilds in this chapter work like those in the *Player's Handbook*, giving you proficiencies, languages, equipment, and suggested characteristics (personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws). Each guild entry also provides personal contacts; suggestions for your alignment, race, and class; and a list of spells that you can add to your spell list if you're a member of a spellcasting class.

#### Guild Spells
The spellcasters of Ravnica's guilds have a style of magic specific to their guild. A guild's description includes a list of guild spells that epitomize the type of magic the guild favors. The Boros Legion, for example, tends to prefer using spells of fire magic and holy light, and its guild spell list reflects that emphasis.

If you play a character who has the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, your guild spells are added to the spell list for your class, thereby expanding the spell options available to you.

#### Bonds and Contacts
As a benefit of your guild membership, you have contacts both inside and outside the guild. Contacts are useful resources in the urban environment of Ravnica, where a friendly face can be more valuable than gold.

As stated in the *Player's Handbook*, bonds represent your connections to people, places, and events in the world. Contacts are people you have a connection to, but they're not necessarily bonds. People can be bonds if they inspire you, motivate you, or make you act against your best interests. (They can represent flaws if their existence amounts to a weakness for you.) Contacts, in comparison, are simply people you know. They might be friends, rivals, or even family members, but their relationship with you is rarely as strong as with a bond.

Although the tables of contacts in this chapter describe nonplayer characters who are members of guilds (your own and others), you are likely to acquire guildless contacts as well. NPCs such as goblin gang leaders, minotaur bartenders, and vedalken tailors all go about their lives in the shadow of the guilds but divorced from those groups' intrigue and politics.

#### Starting Contacts
Your character starts the game with three contacts: an ally in their guild, a rival in their guild, and an ally or rival in another guild. (House Dimir is an exception.) Tables in each guild section help you determine who these contacts are—facts that you can build on by working with your DM to add some details. The table entries for contacts are written in the first person, where "I" is your character.

You'll roll twice on the Contacts table for your guild, unless you're in House Dimir (as explained in that guild's section). Your first roll gives you an ally. Your second roll gives you a rival, who might be friendly, jealous, or antagonistic. (It's possible for these to be the same person; a single person might be generally friendly toward you and simultaneously jealous of your success, for example.) Then you'll roll once on the table of contacts from other guilds. That contact could be either an ally or a rival, or you might instead gain a third contact from your own guild.

> ##### The Guildless
>The guilds might be considered the heart and soul of Ravnica, but they aren't all that makes up the city. Many citizens choose not to join a guild—some because they can't be bothered, and others because they have philosophical objections to the very idea of guilds. The so-called guildless are especially common in areas that might be considered rural: places farther from the heart of the city and the larger exurban districts. But even in the city's heart, some guildless citizens actively oppose the influence of the guilds, blaming the world's strife and suffering on an elite hierarchy that seeks to take control, consolidate wealth, and fragment a populace against itself. The numbers of the guildless include people engaged in a wide variety of trades and services that aren't managed and regulated by the guilds, from baking to cartography. University professors, guides, traders, and bartenders might be guildless. Criminal gangs set themselves up as rivals to the Orzhov, and even military forces operate independent of guild control, serving as neighborhood police forces or mercenaries for hire. About half of Ravnica's population is guildless. That proportion is higher for some races than others: nearly all elves, for example, belong to the Golgari, Selesnya, or Simic guilds, but a majority of goblins are guildless. Loxodons tend to have a strong sense of community, so they readily join guilds. And when they don't, they join groups of another sort, such as mercenary companies or cults. Simic hybrids are all created within the Simic Combine, so it's rare for them not to be part of it.
>

#### Renown
As you advance the goals of your guild through your adventures, you become an increasingly important part of the guild's activities. You might rise through the ranks, eventually taking up a position at the right hand of the guildmaster—or even becoming the master yourself!

Your status in your guild is measured by your renown score. As you increase that score, you gain the opportunity to advance in the ranks of the guild.

When you join a guild as a starting character, your renown score with that guild is 1. Your renown score increases by 1 when you do something to advance the guild's interests, assuming that other members of the guild are aware of what you've done. Each guild's description in this chapter includes a discussion of its goals and your role in pursuing those goals, which your DM will use to judge whether you earn an increase in your renown score.

The various ranks within the guilds describe the range of tasks you might perform, from testing experimental Izzet weaponry to leading a squad of Boros soldiers into battle. When you're assigned a mission that involves an adventure—leaving behind your guild holdings and putting yourself in danger—and you complete that mission, your renown score with that guild increases by 2. Chapter 4 includes information for the DM about missions appropriate for your guild.

Other tasks that don't involve adventuring can also improve your renown score. You can use the time between adventures to improve your renown within your guild by performing these tasks, as well as by socializing with prominent people in the guild. After doing so for a total number of days equal to your current renown score multiplied by 10, your renown score increases by 1.

At your DM's discretion, you might also have a renown score in a guild you don't belong to. You can't ever formally advance in rank within another guild, but a high renown score can earn you additional contacts, favors, and other benefits. This option can be useful in an intrigue-heavy campaign where the adventurers spend a lot of time trying to influence the leaders of various guilds.

#### Benefits of Renown
As you gain renown in a guild, you gain certain benefits. Most benefits are guild-specific, but there are general benefits that apply no matter which guild you belong to:

**Renown 3 or Higher**. When you have a renown score of at least 3 with your own guild, you are an established and respected member of the guild. Other members of the guild have a friendly attitude toward you by default. (Individual members of the guild might have reasons to dislike you despite your renown.) They provide you with lodging and food in dire circumstances and pay for your funeral if needed. If you are accused of a crime, your guild offers legal support, as long as a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime was justifiable.

**Renown 5 or Higher**. When your renown score with any guild reaches 5, you gain an additional contact within the guild. This contact might be a character you met during your adventures or someone who seeks you out because of your fame. Your DM will assign you a contact or have you roll on the Contacts table for the appropriate guild.

Some guilds—notably Azorius, Orzhov, and Boros—have well-defined hierarchies that characters can ascend through as they improve their renown scores.

Other guilds have positions of honor that characters can apply for if their renown score is high enough. Not every member of the Selesnya Conclave aspires to be a sagittar (an archer assigned to guard an important guild location), but any character who meets the prerequisites can apply for the position. Ultimately, the DM decides whether a character qualifies for such a role, with a certain renown score as a minimum requirement.

Several guilds provide a salary among the benefits of renown within the guild. The salary is described as sufficient to maintain a lifestyle of a certain level. If you earn a salary, you can live at the specified lifestyle without paying the normal daily expenditure. See *chapter 5* of the *Player's Handbook* for more information on lifestyle expenses.

A prominent position in a guild often allows you to call on the services of lower-ranking members to assist you in your work. When you do, they are assumed to be loyal followers who help you to the best of their ability. Some of them are assigned to help you for the duration of a single task or mission, while others are under your permanent command, staffing a laboratory, workshop, or garrison where you are in charge. Depending on their role, they might help you in dangerous situations (like combat) or flee from them. You might assign them to perform tasks in your absence, which could include undertaking research, looking for witnesses to a crime, or carrying out a small-scale raid, for example, depending on their role and capabilities. You carry the responsibility for their lives and welfare, ultimately, and if the guild decides that you are abusing your authority and mistreating the members beneath you, you might lose renown, lose your rank or status in the guild, or even be cast out of the guild.

#### Losing Renown
If you commit a serious offense against your guild or its members, you might lose renown within the guild. The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to the DM's discretion. A character's renown score with a guild can never drop below 0. If your renown score drops below the threshold for a rank or privilege you have attained, you lose that benefit. Even if you regain the lost renown, you might find it more difficult to again secure a position or rank you have previously lost.

#### Styles of Membership
As you're playing a character associated with one of the guilds, think about your character's relationship with the guild. Guild members can be grouped into four categories, depending on their motivations and priorities: loyalists, opportunists, rebels, and anomalies. Which one of these descriptions best fits your character?

**Loyalists** join a guild because they firmly believe in the guild's ideals and want to advance its goals. Their membership in the guild is a badge of identity for them. They're typically of the races and classes most strongly associated with the guild, and their personality traits and ideals fall in line with the suggestions in this chapter. An idealistic human or a minotaur paladin in the Boros Legion is an example of a loyalist.

**Opportunists** join a guild based on what they can gain from becoming members. Every guild offers its members something—whether concrete benefits such as opportunities for wealth or more subtle, intangible rewards such as social status—and getting that something is the primary motivation for this type of character. Opportunists often pay lip service to the ideals and goals of the guild, looking out for themselves first and the guild second (at best). A selfish human fighter who uses membership in the Boros Legion as an excuse to bully and steal from others would be an opportunist.

**Rebels** love the guilds they're in but don't conform to guild expectations. They might be good-hearted idealists trying to bend a shady guild toward nobler pursuits, or they might be selfish egotists hoping to direct the guild's actions toward promoting their own interests. Most rebels are typical members of the guild in terms of race and class, but they vary from type when it comes to personalities and ideals. A Boros legionnaire with tyrannical tendencies who thinks the Boros should enforce justice with an iron fist would be a rebel.

**Anomalies** are individuals who join guilds contrary to all expectations. Their race or class (or both) is outside the norm for their guild, but their personalities and ideals fall perfectly in line; that's why they joined. A vedalken paladin in the Boros Legion, or an Ordruun minotaur in the Orzhov Syndicate, would fall into this category.

#### Membership and Independence
Some adventurers do exactly what they're told, spending their careers doing the bidding of their guild superiors. Most adventuring characters, though, prefer more independence. You can roll a d6 or choose from the options in the table below to establish a reason for the freedom enjoyed by your character.

| d6 | Reason for Independence |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | I've been around long enough that my guild lets me do what I want. |
| 2 | I've been chosen for special assignments because I'm just that good. |
| 3 | I've been singled out for special assignments because somebody up the ranks hates me. |
| 4 | I'm moonlighting, and I'd get in trouble if my superiors knew what I was up to. |
| 5 | I've been put at the disposal of another guild because my superiors want to help them. |
| 6 | I've been put at the disposal of another guild because my superiors hope I'll fail. |

#### Changing Guilds
If events in your character's adventuring career warrant it, you can abandon membership in one guild and join a different one. Once you leave a guild, you can rarely go back.

Your DM decides what requirements you must meet to join a new guild. Some guilds welcome new recruits and make the process as simple as possible, while others require a demonstration of loyalty.

When you change guilds, you lose all the privileges of membership in your original guild, including the background feature granted to you by your original guild and any rank or position you have achieved in that guild. You also lose access to your old guild spells, unless they are already on your class's spell list, among your spells known, or in your spellbook. Except in exceptional circumstances, your renown score with your original guild becomes 0.

Your old guild expects you to return your guild insignia, and your new guild gives you one to replace it.

You gain the privileges of membership in your new guild. These include the background feature granted by your new guild, although your DM might decide that it takes you a while to gain the full benefit. For example, a character who leaves another guild to join the Gruul Clans doesn't immediately know the ways of the rubblebelts, but has to gain that familiarity over time. You also gain access to your new guild spells.

Your new guild doesn't give you any benefits that assume prior knowledge or experience, including proficiencies, starting equipment (except your guild insignia), and contacts.

## Azorius Senate
![[015-202.png|right|300]]

*Officer Lavinia stood before the enormous double doors that led into the highest spire of New Prahv, the lair of the guildmaster. To look at her, nothing would seem out of place: her cape spilled elegantly from her officer's armor, her sword shone like a decorative piece one would hang above a mantel, and her three-sided medals displayed her district-spanning rank.*— Doug Beyer, *Return to Ravnica: The Secretist*Bringing order from chaos—that is the mission of the Azorius Senate. Without the extensive legal code crafted and enforced by the Azorius, society would crumble, transforming Ravnica into a field of rubble where the Gruul and the **Rakdos** do whatever they please. The Azorius carry this weighty responsibility with stoic pride, and they perform their work of legislation, investigation, and enforcement with steely determination.

The first guildmaster of the Azorius Senate was a sphinx named Azor. He was the author of the original Guildpact, as well as the creator of the elaborate contingency plan that resulted in the creation of the Living Guildpact. The Azorius Senate was meant to carry on his legacy by serving as the legislative body of Ravnica.

### Inside the Senate
The Azorius Senate is supported by three branches, called columns, each led by an arbiter (also called a capital). The capitals of the three columns form the Triumvirate, which advises the guildmaster, Supreme Judge **Isperia**, an ancient and wise sphinx.

The **Sova Column** consists of judges and the extensive legal apparatus surrounding them. It is tasked with adjudicating and arbitrating the effects of the law. The column employs legal aides, pages, librarians, experts on precedent, advocates for the accused, public prosecutors, and judges.

The **Jelenn Column** writes and enacts the laws of Ravnica, involving the efforts not just of the designated legislators but also a network of bureaucrats: aides, writers, researchers, lobbyists, clerks, and so on.

The **Lyev Column** enforces the law as Ravnica's police force. The many-leveled hierarchy of the Lyev Column includes arresters, investigators, officers, and lawmages. The Lyev Column is also venturing into the work of managing surveillance and precognition. Most adventuring characters, by their nature and because of their capabilities, are associated with the active work of the Lyev Column rather than the behind-the-scenes activity of the other columns.

#### Goals of the Azorius
The Azorius Senate's ultimate goal is the perfection of society. They want to protect the people of Ravnica and foster a community of peace and harmony. A society's values, they contend, are reflected in the laws it creates. Something is good if it is lawful. To the Azorius, the highest virtue is a society built on stability and order, and the guild's elaborate system of laws is structured to prevent wrongdoing first and foremost, even at the expense of certain liberties. The Azorius can act as a benevolent proactive force that keeps evildoers in check, but it can also act as an oppressive bureaucratic force that stifles freedom and expression.

In the absence of the Living Guildpact, the Azorius are uncertain who is supposed to maintain balance among the guilds. As a group, they are convinced that the system can't be disrupted, but they are challenged by the reality that the one person who is meant to hold their world together never seems to be around. The Azorius Senate is invoking emergency powers with increasing frequency, and the Lyev Column's enforcers are wielding an ever-growing amount of influence.

The Azorius guild embraces the belief that Ravnican society has come too far to succumb to chaos. Civilization can be saved only through the guidance of a strong, safety-focused government. In the mind of the Azorius, the threat of chaos is imminent. They believe it is time to face facts and do whatever is necessary to protect the people and preserve the force of law.

The Azorius, as always, see agents of disorder as their greatest enemies. They have cracked down on the Gruul Clans and imposed a variety of creatively written laws outlawing that guild's presence in as many public places as possible. The Azorius also abhor the satirical shows of the **Rakdos** (in part because the Azorius are frequently ridiculed by **Rakdos** performers) and attempt to curb them with new decrees about public performances. In response to attempts by other guilds to edge their way around the system, the Azorius routinely create new laws to support or countermand old ones.

### Azorius Characters
**Alignment**: Usually lawful, often neutral

**Suggested Races**: Human, vedalken

**Suggested Classes**: Bard, cleric, fighter, paladin, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Azorius Senate if one or more of the following statements are true:

- You're drawn to the idea of a hard-bitten police officer trying to impose order on a chaotic world.
- You like the idea of using magic to control enemies.
- You like playing enchanter wizards, clerics of law, or unbending paladins.

#### Joining the Azorius Senate
As a recruit to the Azorius Senate, you were quickly immersed in the law. You might have clerked for a judge or a legislator, been an apprentice to a practitioner of law magic, studied rhetoric with diplomats, or trained to patrol the streets and enforce the law. As your training comes to an end and your adventuring career begins, you must decide whether to focus on law enforcement or to operate primarily within the bureaucracy of the senate.

#### Law Enforcement
Most Azorius adventurers belong to the guild's police force. They are soldiers or spellcasters who patrol the city in teams or singly, preventing crimes or stopping them in progress. If you want to pursue a career in law enforcement, choose the path of the lawmage, the precognitive mage, or the arrester.

***Lawmages.*** As a spellcaster in the Azorius Senate, you use your magic to compel or restrain malefactors and scofflaws (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the School of Enchantment). You might also use your magic to protect Azorius soldiers and innocent bystanders from harm (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the School of Abjuration or as a cleric of the Order Domain, which is described in *chapter 1*). In any case, you're called a lawmage, and you can aspire to the title of justiciar and then deputy as your standing within the guild increases.

***Precognitive Mages.*** If you are a spellcaster with some ability to glimpse the future (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Divination or a cleric of the Knowledge Domain), you can use this ability to try to prevent crime before it occurs, serving as a precognitive mage. These mages occupy a small niche on the periphery of the guild, and the guild hasn't developed a bureaucratic structure to accommodate them, so they advance through the same ranks as lawmages.

***Arresters.*** As a martial character, you can serve as an arrester in the Azorius Senate. You might be a fighter (of any martial archetype) or a paladin who has sworn the Oath of Vengeance, for example. Arresters maintain the peace by removing threats—both actual and potential—identified through regular patrols, citizen reports, and occasionally alerts from the precognitive mages. As you gain the respect of your superiors, you can be promoted to the rank of officer or imperator.

#### Bureaucracy
Bureaucracy might seem like the opposite of adventure, but it is possible to immerse yourself in the life of a civil servant in the Azorius Senate and still live an adventurous life. You might be a mild-mannered judge's clerk or scribe who got caught up in a whirlwind chain of events beyond your control, or you might moonlight as a vigilante in defiance of the law you are supposed to uphold. Or you could serve a diplomatic function as an elocutor.

***Elocutors.*** As a skilled orator and diplomat (perhaps a bard of the College of Lore), you can put your talents to use in the guild as an elocutor. The Azorius are known for their measured, patient speech, and the elocutors are the primary voice through which the senate communicates with the other guilds and the people of Ravnica. Thus, you might serve as an emissary from the Azorius to another guild, working to settle trade or territorial agreements, temporary alliances, and the like. You might have the task of securing the support of key senators for a particular piece of legislation or treaty. Well-established elocutors can be rewarded with the rank of scribe or emissary.

![[016-203.png|right|300]]

The Azorius Functionary background is available for characters who are part of the Azorius guild.

#### An Azorius Party
An adventuring party made up entirely of Azorius members could be a specialized team dedicated to law enforcement. A soldier (a fighter or paladin) and a lawmage (wizard) would form the core of the party, supported by a precognitive mage (cleric) who helps direct their missions. An elocutor (bard) could round out the party, serving as the group's negotiator and spokesperson.

![[017-204.png|right|300]]

> ##### Three Capitals
>The heads of the three columns of the Azorius Senate are called arbiters or capitals. The arbiter of the Sova Column (the judiciary) is Leonos II, a wise and kind human judge and lawmage who takes pains to consider all perspectives before issuing a judgment—even the perspectives of the spirits of the dead, with whom he can communicate. He is patient and utterly loyal to the guild. The Jelenn Column (the legislature) is led by a vedalken lawmage named Uzana, renowned for a nearly perfect memory. She has memorized every statute of Azorius law, and much of her speech is quotations from those statutes. The hussar commander Agmand Sarv is the arbiter of the Lyev Column, the senate's law enforcement branch. Despite the fact that he has never been in combat, he has earned a reputation as a brilliant military strategist. His tactical genius is unquestioned, but his lack of battle experience did cause some controversy among the soldiers and lawmages of the Lyev Column when he was appointed to be its head.
>

#### Rank and Renown
By gaining renown as a member of the Azorius Senate, you can advance within the guild. Promotion through the ranks requires the approval of a superior officer. Advancement is a reward for services rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.

#### Rank 1: Official
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Azorius Senate*

Your specific title depends on your role in the guild:

- If you are a lawmage or a precognitive mage, you assume the title of justiciar.
- If you are an arrester, you become an officer.
- If you are a bureaucrat (including an elocutor), you become a scribe.

As an Azorius official, you can call on recruits (use the **soldier** stat block) to perform mundane tasks and errands for you, but they will not accompany you into dangerous circumstances.

No Azorius official lives in poverty. Between adventures, you earn a salary that supports you at a modest lifestyle.

#### Rank 2: Authority
*Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Azorius Senate*

Your new title depends on your previous role as an official in the Azorius Senate:

- If you are a justiciar, you become a deputy with a specific title, such as Deputy of Acquittals, Deputy of Indictment, Deputy of Deposition, Deputy of Arraignment, or Deputy of Arbitration.
- If you are an officer, you become an imperator.
- If you are a scribe, you become an emissary.

You are recognized as an authority in your field. You gain an Azorius charm (described in *chapter 5*) at the start of each mission you undertake on the guild's behalf. At the start of any such mission, you can secure the assistance of a squad of 1d4 arresters (use the **soldier** stat block) plus one **lawmage**. These individuals remain with you until the mission ends.

Between adventures, you earn enough money pursuing your duties to support yourself at a comfortable lifestyle.

#### Rank 3: Minister, Judge, or Senator
*Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Azorius Senate*

Your new title depends on your broader interests as they relate to one of the three columns of the Azorius Senate, not on the titles you bore as an official and an authority:

- If your interests lie in law enforcement, you become a minister within the Lyev Column. You receive a specific title, such as Minister of Impediments or Minister of Fallacies.
- If your interests concern the judiciary, you become a judge within the Sova Column.
- If you want a position on the legislative body of the Jelenn Column, you become a senator.

Regardless of your specific title, you can secure the aid of up to 3d4 **soldiers** and one or two **lawmages** whenever you set out on a guild-approved mission.

Between adventures, your responsibilities to the guild—including supervising arresters, judging legal cases, or writing laws—earns you enough money to support yourself at a wealthy lifestyle.

#### Rank 4: Arbiter
![[018-205.png|right|300]]

*Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the Azorius Senate*

As an arbiter (or capital), you serve as the head of your column. Only **Isperia**, the Supreme Judge, can appoint you to this position, and only if one of the three existing arbiters leaves her service.

As an arbiter, all the resources of your column are at your disposal, and you have the ear of **Isperia** as a member of her advisory Triumvirate. You also keep the salary you earned as a minister, judge, or senator, sustaining a wealthy lifestyle between adventures.

#### Enemies and Allies
As far as the Azorius are concerned, every other guild in Ravnica is hastening along the road to anarchy. Even other guilds that are inclined toward order (such as the Boros, Orzhov, and Selesnya) are ignoring or exploiting the law.

You participate in missions to thwart the criminals of other guilds, from overzealous Boros vigilantes to insidious Golgari assassins. Dimir spies, Orzhov extortionists, and bloodthirsty **Rakdos** performers keep Azorius peacekeepers busy enough, without the added complications of reckless Izzet and Simic experiments putting the citizenry in danger.

Of course, whenever the members of another guild decide to operate within the law, they are potential allies for the Azorius. Even some members of the Cult of **Rakdos** can be pragmatic enough to stifle their impulses for a time in order to join forces against a common enemy.

> ##### The Azorius View on Other Guilds
>Because of its authoritarian, overreaching grasp, the Azorius Senate's relationships with other guilds are rarely positive. Azorius members tend to view members of other guilds as dangerous threats to order, while other guild members see the Azorius as rigid and tyrannical.
>
>- **Boros** "Their vigilantism is tremendously dangerous without a hand to control it."
>- **Dimir** "A perennial thorn in our side. Though they were once our greatest foes, not even the masters of espionage can hide from our watchful eyes."
>- **Golgari** "Their underground structures break numerous building regulations, but at least they fulfill their duties as garbage collectors."
>- **Gruul** "The Gruul are dangerous anarchists with no interest in furthering the development of civilization. They serve no useful purpose."
>- **Izzet** "Eccentric and occasionally explosive, but generally harmless, for now. In their paranoia they have enlarged their weapon stockpiles, but they lack the clarity of vision to put them to use."
>- **Orzhov** "Their brazen exploitation of our laws will be their downfall. They are an insidious threat that could tear society apart from the inside."
>- **Rakdos** "An absolute blight on Ravnica. They are clowns who know nothing of culture and exist only to torment the functioning members of society."
>- **Selesnya** "The Conclave plays by the rules and keeps to itself. Until its members become too numerous, they are of little threat to us."
>- **Simic** "The Simic experiment with matters that disobey the laws of nature and the laws of Ravnica. We must not let them gain influence."

## Boros Legion
![[019-206.png|right|300]]

*A brown-bearded, broad-chested man clad in massive-shouldered plate armor led a battalion of soldiers, the symbol of the Boros Legion emblazoned on white cloth draped over their armor. Their soldiers were a variety of races, including humans, a minotaur with a permanent scowl on her face, an impatient-looking goblin, and even some kind of humanoid fire elemental, whose Boros armor floated in protective positions over its animate flame.*— Doug Beyer, Return to Ravnica: The SecretistClad in shining armor and fueled by righteous zeal, the soldiers of the Boros Legion take up steel against the corruption and lawlessness that gnaw at the soul of Ravnica. Combining the force of law with the military strength to back it up, the Boros work to forge Ravnica into a just society, a safe and healthy community for all. From garrisons throughout the sprawling city, disciplined, stalwart soldiers are dispatched to stand firm against Gruul raids, Dimir infiltration, Golgari corruption, and the subtle influence of more nefarious foes.

The archangel Razia was the original guildmaster of the Boros Legion, which was established to serve as Ravnica's standing army. Razia served as its guildmaster for almost ten thousand years. Legend says that all the other angels of Ravnica were created in the image of this semidivine figure, and her death was devastating to the guild. **Aurelia**, the current angelic guildmaster, is the third to hold that title.

> ##### A Proud Martial Tradition
>Minotaurs have a reputation for being both fierce warriors and clever strategists. Thick of muscle, stout of heart, and possessing a burning love of justice and the battlefield, they have become the steel spine of the Boros Legion. Generations of minotaurs of the Ordruun family line have served with honor and distinction, claiming more than fifteen generals to their lineage.
>

### Inside the Legion
Angels occupy the highest tier of the Boros hierarchy, from the guildmaster **Aurelia** down to the hosts of holy warriors and advisors in leadership roles. Their opinions and advice are deeply respected in the guild, though the angels aren't above engaging in the machinations of mortal politics. The angels include the wise, strategic warleaders; the holy champions and paragons of war known as firemanes; and battleforce angels, who form the bulk of the legion's angelic warriors.

From the perspective of the average Boros soldier, the angels embody the ideals the Boros hold dear. Few mortal soldiers gain admission into the presence of the warleaders and other powerful angels, but battleforce angels fight at the forefront of the legion's ranks, and they form strong friendships with mortals under such life-and-death circumstances. Boros paladins are the members most likely to converse with the angels and be charged with implementing their plans.

The garrison commanders who convey the angels' commands are accessible to the ordinary soldier. In addition to Sunhome, the Boros maintain smaller garrisons throughout the Tenth District, at least one in each of the six precincts.

#### Goals of the Boros
Wherever criminals exploit others, petty tyrants make grabs for power, or violence erupts and leaves devastation in its wake, Boros soldiers are there fighting to make things right.

The Boros Legion is defined by the tension between its goal of establishing order and harmony and the fiery zeal that drives many of its members. The guild stands for peace and justice, which can be established only through the rule of law. Its moral stance is fundamentally good, as it strives to protect the innocent and powerless from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, members of the legion are passionate about their pursuit of justice, spurred by their righteous wrath into action against evil and injustice. Ironically, this means that individual members sometimes break the rules they are charged with enforcing, cleaving to the spirit of the law when the letter no longer serves justice.

Because the Guildpact—the one force on Ravnica that can keep the guilds from destroying each other—is now embodied in a single, unreliable person who vanishes for weeks or months at a time, the legion is in a heightened state of vigilance. In this time of uncertainty, the Boros are on constant alert for military threats. They work to maintain their fortifications to ensure that they aren't overrun by Gruul marauders. Construction proceeds on new strongholds near Gruul territories, but in general the Boros prepare for a military threat the same way they always have—by fielding the stronger army.

The angels are also bracing for a subtler threat: the danger of infiltration by House Dimir. The Boros are becoming increasingly aware of the possibility that their guild could be undermined from within. Security at garrison buildings is vigilant, with angels watching the entrances at all times for spies.

### Boros Characters
**Alignment**: Usually good, often lawful

**Suggested Races**: Human, goblin, minotaur

**Suggested Classes**: Cleric, fighter, paladin, ranger, wizard

Consider the Boros Legion for your character if one or more of the following sentences ring true:

- You are drawn to the ideal of the knight in shining armor.
- You like playing clerics, paladins, or disciplined fighters.
- Smiting foes with holy radiance fills you with righteous joy.
- You want to protect the innocent and fight for justice.

![[020-207.png|right|300]]

#### Joining the Boros Legion
As a new recruit to the Boros Legion, you were sent to the prestigious Horizon Military Academy for training. Your life there was tempered in the forge of Boros discipline, devotion, and zeal. Your training regimen was deliberately harsh, to weed out the uncommitted. You lasted to the end, and now you begin your adventuring career ready to put everything you have learned to use in the legion's service. Depending on whether you focused on martial training, studied magic, or pursued both courses, your path will look somewhat different.

#### Martial Training
The bulk of the Boros Legion consists of human, minotaur, and goblin soldiers. If you are a fighter, ranger, or even a barbarian, you'll fit right in among the ranks, with a promising career path ahead of you—promotion through the ranks, with opportunities for special assignments.

Another option is to join the swiftblades, the vanguard of the Boros Legion. They specialize in assault and occupation, and their squads often function as commandos or guerrillas. They pick off enemy archers and mages, softening the enemy's front lines before the rest of the legion marches in.

#### Magical Study
If you are spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Evocation or a cleric of the Light Domain), you can find a place as a combat mage in the Boros Legion, called an embermage. These mages use spells of fire and light to clear the way for the legion's combat troops.

If you prefer healing magic over the explosive magic of the embermages (perhaps as a cleric of the Life or the Light Domain), you can become a medic. These combat healers are an essential part of Boros operations, using a combination of magic and mundane medicine to close wounds and restore strength.

#### Military Magic
If you are a paladin who swears the Oath of Devotion, a fighter of the Eldritch Knight archetype, or a cleric of the War Domain, you can combine the martial training of a soldier with magic and call yourself a firefist. Fueled by a healthy dose of righteous zeal, firefists command a great deal of respect in the Boros Legion.

![[022-209.png|right|300]]The Boros Legionnaire background is available for characters who are part of the Boros guild.

#### A Boros Party
An adventuring party drawn entirely from the ranks of the Boros Legion would be a small military strike force, probably focused on combat but also strong on social interaction. One or two soldiers (fighters), a medic (cleric), and an embermage (wizard) would form the core of that strike force. A firefist (paladin) would be a strong addition, or might replace a fighter or a cleric. A lightly armored swiftblade (ranger) could help the group in situations involving stealth or exploration.

#### Rank and Renown
By gaining renown as a member of the Boros Legion, you can ascend through an ordered series of ranks within the guild. Promotion always requires the approval of a superior officer. It is a reward for services rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.

In addition, certain positions become available to you when both your renown and your character level reach certain thresholds.

#### Rank 1: Sergeant
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Boros Legion*

At this rank, you gain some authority over lower-ranking soldiers. When you undertake a mission on the guild's behalf that requires military strength, a squad of 1d4 **soldiers** accompanies and assists you for the duration of the mission.

Your salary at this rank is enough to maintain a modest lifestyle, including private quarters in the garrison.

#### Skyknight (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher in the Boros Legion, 5th level or higher*

Skyknights mounted on Skyjek rocs patrol the skies above Ravnica—a regular reminder of the Boros and their concern for justice. If you meet the prerequisites, you can become a skyknight, assuming no official objects. You are assigned a **Skyjek roc** to use as a mount when carrying out your guild responsibilities. Using the roc for personal matters is a significant violation of regulations.

#### Wojek (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 5 or higher in the Boros Legion, 5th level or higher*

If you meet the prerequisites, you can apply to join the elite soldiers of the Wojek League. This special order serves as a combination of military police and military intelligence, giving it a fair degree of independence within the guild. Its members scout the activities of other guilds to assess their military strength and predict potential threats, and they sometimes activate squads to defuse threats before they grow more serious. The Wojeks also help the angels root out spies and leaks within the legion. Secondarily, the Wojek League is responsible for policing the ranks of the legion. When members get carried away by their zeal and break the law or abuse their authority, the Wojeks take on the tasks of investigating, apprehending, and punishing the malefactors. Similarly, if members of the legion disappear (involuntarily or otherwise), Wojek agents are typically the ones called to investigate.

You can be both a skyknight and a member of the Wojek League, gaining the title of Skyjek.

#### Rank 2: Brigadier
![[023-210.png|right|300]]

*Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Boros Legion*

As a brigadier, you are responsible for missions and strategies that you can't execute entirely on your own or with the aid of a handful of soldiers. After receiving goals handed down from the captain above you, it's your job to figure out the tactics needed to accomplish those goals.

You lead a brigade that consists of six squads, each made up of four soldiers commanded by a sergeant (use the **soldier** stat block to represent them). If you are also a skyknight, at least one of these squads is made up of other skyknights, which are **soldiers** mounted on **Skyjek rocs**. You can assign these squads to tasks of your choosing within the area of the city where you have authority. You can also lead these soldiers into battle yourself, or bring one squad and its sergeant with you on a guild mission.

At this rank, you gain a Boros charm (described in *chapter 5*) at the start of each mission you undertake on the guild's behalf. You continue to receive a salary sufficient to maintain a modest lifestyle, but your quarters in the garrison are more spacious.

#### Sunhome Guard (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Boros Legion, 7th level or higher*

Members of the Sunhome Guard are responsible for the defense of Sunhome, the Boros guildhall in the Tenth District. Only those who have proven themselves in combat are selected to join this force. If you are accepted into the Sunhome Guard, your missions will be primarily defensive in nature. You might receive orders to find new ways to fortify the guildhall or to detect Dimir agents and other spies who try to gain access. Of course, given these chaotic times, you could end up defending Sunhome from an all-out attack by the Gruul or some other enemy force.

#### Rank 3: Captain
*Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Boros Legion*

As a captain in the Boros Legion, you gain command of a small garrison and the responsibility for maintaining order and protecting people in part of a city district. You have four brigades under your command. As described for rank 3, each brigade has six squads of five soldiers (including a sergeant) reporting to them. One additional squad of 2d4 soldiers is your personal retinue.

You regularly receive communications from warleader angels who coordinate the efforts of the smaller garrisons. They keep you informed of the goals and concerns of the legion's mortal and angelic leaders and can help you address them. You are then responsible for giving orders to your brigadiers, and you must answer to your commander for the troops' success or failure in achieving the guild's strategic goals.

As a captain, your salary allows you to maintain a comfortable lifestyle between adventures.

#### Rank 4: Commander
*Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the Boros Legion*

As a commander, you assume the leadership of one of the major garrisons of the Boros Legion: Kamen Fortress, Horizon Military Academy, or the great flying garrison called *Parhelion II*, which moves from place to place to deploy reinforcements to Boros troops around Ravnica. If you are already a member of the Sunhome Guard, you could instead be placed in command of that elite force, leading all the non-angelic forces of Sunhome.

In this role, you are advised—and ordered around—by angels. You are in regular communication with Guildmaster **Aurelia**, who places you in charge of a major guild initiative. You might be tasked with improving recruitment, developing a plan for dealing with Dimir infiltration, or collaborating with the Izzet to develop new weaponry for Boros soldiers.

You continue to draw a salary sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

#### Enemies and Allies
In general, the Boros find some common ground with other guilds that value order and structure: Azorius, Selensya, and (to a lesser extent) Orzhov. The **Rakdos**, Gruul, and Izzet might share the zeal and energy of the Boros, but they represent the more chaotic aspect of those qualities, which threatens the stability of all Ravnica.

The legion is dedicated to combating the influence of Dimir spies and infiltrators, containing the brutal chaos of the **Rakdos**, and halting the schemes of the Golgari. But any guild can become an enemy of Boros if its aims and activities lead to crime, chaos, injustice, or harm to the innocent citizens of Ravnica. Even the Azorius can become so obsessive in creating and enforcing laws that they overreach the bounds of justice.

Conversely, any guild can offer you allies in your quest for justice. Distasteful as they might be, even the Gruul and the **Rakdos** can play a part in curtailing threats to the city that also impede their own interests.

> ##### The Boros View on Other Guilds
>The Boros are committed to justice and order, and they are convinced that virtually every other guild is just as committed to undermining both. Therefore, the Boros rely only on their comrades for support and view everyone else with suspicion or disdain.
>
>- **Azorius** "Legalism. Arrogance. Hot air. The law in their hands is a bludgeon, and they use it to seize more power than they deserve."
>- **Dimir** "Snakes lurking in the shadows. They should be rooted out so they can shrivel in the light."
>- **Golgari** "If they limited themselves to their intended purpose, repulsive as it is, they could be allowed to survive. But they are growing into a dangerous menace, and we need to flush them out of the sewers while we still can."
>- **Gruul** "They are lost in violence and savagery. Only occasionally can their energy be channeled in directions that benefit the greater good."
>- **Izzet** "They don't understand the concept of limits. If they kept their spellcraft under control, they could truly benefit society."
>- **Orzhov** "The Orzhov care only about the Orzhov. If it were up to them, all of Ravnica would follow an orderly process designed to funnel wealth into their grasping hands."
>- **Rakdos** "They make destruction into a spectacle, but they're more than blood and fire. They're termites gnawing away at the heart and soul of Ravnica."
>- **Selesnya** "I almost envy the naiveté that leads them to retreat into their little communes and pretend they've built a just society."
>- **Simic** "They have stepped out of their place, with all their experiments, their tinkering with the nature of life. They're a waste, a drain on Ravnica, and a danger to the public good."

## House Dimir
![[024-211.png|right|300]]

*A vampire appeared out of the darkness, as quiet as a breeze. He was stripped to the waist despite the chill underground, and his eyes reflected light like a cat's. He floated effortlessly down from the upper reaches of the chamber, and alighted on the chamber floor near the two of them.*— Doug Beyer, *Return to Ravnica: The Secretist*House Dimir is Ravnica's dark secret: behind a facade of respectable messengers and reporters lurks an association of spies and assassins whose existence is barely suspected by the populace at large. Secrecy is both House Dimir's best weapon and its best defense, and much of the guild's work is hidden even from other members. Dimir agents leave no trace of their covert activities, warping the memories of witnesses to their crimes and even wiping their own minds to remove any evidence of their completed assignments.

The first guildmaster of House Dimir was a vampire named Szadek, whose organization agreed to serve as Ravnica's couriers, information brokers, and librarians. But Szadek also used his guild's expertise at gathering information to build a vast spy network, and before long, the secret operations of the guild vastly outweighed its overt ones. Eventually the guild disappeared into the shadows, and most Ravnicans came to doubt its existence. An immortal entity, Szadek ruled the guild for ten thousand years until he was arrested and killed in the turmoil of the Decamillennial Celebration.

### Inside the House
House Dimir has a clandestine aspect hidden from all but its most important members. The guildmaster, **Lazav**, and his direct contacts guide and manipulate the covert operations of the guild. Members of House Dimir ultimately receive their orders from this source without having any idea of who issued the order or why. Messages to agents are funneled through thought strands (see "Spell: *Encode Thoughts*" later in this section) and telepathic couriers.

By design, you don't have much interaction with other members of your guild. You might never meet your primary guild contact face to face, instead receiving assignments and sending reports by way of secret message drops and codes.

#### Goals of the Dimir
House Dimir is all about secrets and misinformation, even where its own members are concerned. Any given Dimir agent knows of no more than a handful of alleyway contacts and dossier drop spots. One agent knows another only by a code name, or receives communications only at a particular meeting spot at a specific place and time. Every self-proclaimed expert with an opinion on the matter has a theory about the guild's intentions, and all those guesses about Dimir's motivations and pursuits contradict each other, frustrating any attempt to get to the truth of things. The public face of Dimir remains inscrutable, which some interpret as the best evidence that the guild's true plans mean something dire for the Ravnican populace.

To House Dimir, knowledge is power. The guild hungers to learn everything it doesn't already know, especially the weaknesses of its adversaries, and to exploit those weaknesses for its own gain. Conversely, the house holds its own secrets tightly, because it doesn't want its enemies to turn the tables. The Dimir lurk in the shadows, methodically gathering the knowledge they need to remake Ravnica to their advantage.

House Dimir's progress toward its goals depends on a web woven from meticulously gathered intelligence. Unpredictable behavior by other guilds can destabilize that web. When the Boros take sudden, forceful action inspired by an unexpected burst of zeal, the Dimir can be caught off guard. The Selesnya behave predictably on the whole, but the members of the conclave are so numerous that it can be hard for the Dimir to keep track of their activities. Of all the other guilds, the Izzet and the Gruul concern the Dimir the most; their erratic methods of decision-making, combined with their unflinching approach to danger, can quickly undermine any Dimir strategy designed to contain them.

### Dimir Characters
**Alignment**: Usually neutral, sometimes evil

**Suggested Races**: Half-elf, human

**Suggested Classes**: Monk, rogue, wizard

If the following sentences describe you, you might enjoy playing a character who belongs to House Dimir:

- You love subterfuge, intrigue, and deception.
- You like to play rogues, spies, and assassins.
- The idea of stealing thoughts instead of treasure has a special appeal to you.
- You want to deceive your fellow players without necessarily betraying them.

#### Joining House Dimir
You began your career in House Dimir as part of the legion of shopkeepers, librarians, couriers, and traders who maintain the deception that the guild has become civil and tame. Without any exposure to the guild's more covert activities, you helped to discredit those who believe that the Dimir are plotting to control the city, painting them as delusional conspiracy theorists. But at some point your gifts were recognized and you were invited into the deeper mysteries of the guild. Your training focused on stealth, espionage, and infiltration. As a Dimir spy, you might bring a variety of talents to your work.

In your guild role, you engage in surveillance, theft, sabotage, infiltration, and other kinds of espionage. You work in a pocket or sleeper cell, unaware of the identities of most other agents or the guild's leadership. You might be a rogue of the Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster archetype, a monk of the Way of Shadow, or even a cleric of the Trickery Domain.

If you are a spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion), you have the skills needed to join the ranks of the most feared spellcasters on Ravnica: House Dimir's mind mages. Your basic work and role is the same as any other spy's, but you can learn to pull thoughts and memories from a person's mind, use a target's own thoughts against them, attack your foes' psyches directly to create delusions, or scour enemy minds clean.

![[025-212.png|right|300]]

The Dimir Operative background is available for characters who are part of the Dimir guild.

#### A Dimir Party
House Dimir might send an adventuring party on missions focused on stealth and subterfuge. Such a team might be made up mostly of rogues and perhaps monks, with a mind mage (wizard) providing magical support. Potions help to offset the group's lack of healing ability.

#### Rank and Renown
![[026-213.png|right|300]]

As you gain renown within House Dimir, you will be rewarded with missions of increasing importance. No formal ranks exist for you to progress through, but certain thresholds of renown indicate improvements in your standing within the guild. Perhaps most important, according to the philosophy of House Dimir, higher standing brings greater knowledge of the inner workings of Ravnica and the guild.

At the start of your career, your orders include step-by-step instructions—or they consist of just a single task. You receive these instructions from your guild contact.

#### Independent Agent
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in House Dimir*

As an independent agent, you have considerable latitude in the way you choose to implement your mission goals.

You acquire a *spies' murmur* (described in *chapter 5*)—a magic device that allows you to communicate telepathically with other Dimir agents who wear similar items. If this item is lost or destroyed, it's up to you to secure a replacement.

#### Collector of Secrets
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in House Dimir*

By the time you reach this level of renown in House Dimir, you are amassing a significant collection of secrets about the people and places around you. You know the location of a hidden safe house where you can take shelter in case of dire need. At the DM's discretion, you might also know (or be able to find out) a secret about a person or group who lives or operates in a neighborhood you're familiar with. The secret is typically a person's flaw or details about a dark episode in a group's past. Whatever it is, the secret is a weakness that can be used to manipulate the person or group to assist you or your associates.

In addition, you gain a Dimir charm (described in *chapter 5*) at the start of each mission you undertake on the guild's behalf.

#### Inner Circle
*Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in House Dimir*

At this level of renown, you are responsible for coordinating the activities of several other Dimir agents. You still receive orders from the usual source, but you're given broad goals and wide latitude in how to carry them out, including delegating specific tasks to other Dimir agents of lesser renown. You are also increasingly trusted with important secrets.

#### Guildmaster's Confidant
*Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in House Dimir*

Few members of House Dimir ever encounter **Lazav**, and those who do are often unaware that they are dealing with the guildmaster. You have been admitted to his circle of confidants. He has entrusted you with a wide network of Dimir agents under your command, but you also bear tremendous responsibility for the success of the missions they undertake.

#### Enemies and Allies
![[027-214.png|right|300]]

It's hard for a guild built on stealth and secrecy to maintain a positive relationship with any other guild. All guilds are monitored with suspicion, and they assessed for their current and prospective levels of threat, as well as for their usefulness to House Dimir's schemes. Each cell may foster its own relationships with the other guilds, but it ultimately defers to Dimir's enigmatic leaders to steer overarching strategy.

Your missions might put you at odds with any other guild by calling on you to infiltrate that guild and gain insight into its plans, steal proprietary information from its guildhall, or subvert its leadership. For instance, you could be tasked to steal the transcript of an Azorius interrogation, the memories of Golgari spy, or the contents of an Orzhov ledger.

You might cooperate with members of other guilds, openly or in disguise, insofar as their goals don't conflict with yours. Sometimes, the easiest way to assassinate one of your enemies is to put the forces of law on their trail, so joining forces with the Azorius and Boros, for example, can be a beneficial arrangement for everyone concerned.

> ##### The Dimir View on Other Guilds
>To House Dimir, every other guild is a potential source of information, its members all potential foils and patsies.
>
>- **Azorius** "They can't be allowed to monopolize the flow of knowledge. Clog their networks with misinformation. To stop someone from discerning the truth, drown them in plausible untruths."
>- **Boros** "Not inherently dangerous. The true danger is that they'll drag down all we've worked for while chasing some romantic crusade. Continue to direct their righteous fury toward our strongest enemy—until the Boros threaten to become the strongest."
>- **Golgari** "We once appreciated them for their ability to make a corpse disappear, but we found that too many of our victims rose up to face us again. Now we use the city's fear of the swarm to keep them in their place. The more the Golgari try to rise from the mire of their reputation, the more we make them wallow in it."
>- **Gruul** "They've always been convenient scapegoats, but their recent aggressiveness threatens to become a larger problem. We must thin their numbers—selectively and without confrontation. Catch them alone in the dark, and take them out one by one."
>- **Izzet** "Even an overloaded, sizzled clock is still right twice a day. When Izzet experiments succeed, they can have unpredictable consequences for active missions. Their activities must be monitored at all times."
>- **Orzhov** "We're amused at how well they've used their hierarchy to mask the corruption of their organization, but their need for the public's trust gives us an edge. They can be manipulated by playing on their fear of the people discovering their ruse."
>- **Rakdos** "They've turned pointless activity into an art form, but their performances nevertheless make very useful distractions. Let them be bright and loud, drawing all attention, while we slip quietly through the dark."
>- **Selesnya** "Strength without guile is perhaps the most dangerous kind. One can't bluff the player who can't conceive of bluffing. Currently, the covert war plays to our strengths; we must ensure that the conclave never becomes conscious of the advantages they possess."
>- **Simic** "They are never short of intriguing surprises, so we know they are gearing up for something. Keep eyes inside their organization to see what their efforts are leading to—but don't be tempted to partake of their enhancements."

## Golgari Swarm
![[028-215.png|right|300]]

*A small crowd of pale elves and humans stepped into the light. Bits of bone and detritus woven into their matted hair clicked lightly. Their chitinous armor swarmed with tiny, riotous insects that moved in and out of the sheen of moss growing on their shoulders—a bed for sprouting fungi. Whether it was the Golgari themselves who had made the chittering sound or their bugs, Ral could not be sure.*— Doug Beyer, *Return to Ravnica: The Secretist*The teeming masses that compose the Golgari Swarm see themselves as pragmatic above all else, uncowed by the simple fact that death is part of the cycle of life. They believe the idea of life and death as opposing forces to be nothing more than naive sentimentality. They know everything crumbles and rots in the end, and then new life springs from that rot. Time inevitably passes, bringing both destruction and new creation to all things.

The original mandate of the Golgari Swarm under the leadership of Svogthir, its Devkarin founder, was to maintain Ravnica's agriculture and manage its waste. But Svogthir's interest in necromancy, and his eventual transformation into a lich, shaped the course of the guild's activities and gave birth to its philosophy of embracing death as part of nature's cycle.

### Inside the Swarm
The leadership of the Golgari has undergone several major changes, but the nature of the swarm makes it easily adaptable to the churn of continuous cycles. Being alive isn't a prerequisite for leadership, as demonstrated by the rule of the current guildmaster, the elf lich **Jarad Vod Savo**. Assassination is seen as a perfectly valid means of effecting political change, which is how Jarad's sister, Savra, took control of the guild before him. Various groups of people and monsters coexist within the swarm, their relative power waxing and waning with the years, and through it all, the guild goes on.

The three most important power groups within the Golgari are the Devkarin elves, the medusas (also called gorgons in Ravnica), and the insectile kraul. Jarad is an undead representative of the Devkarin, so the elves claim a privileged position within the guild for the moment.

Members of the Golgari Swarm live in the shadow of Jarad and the leaders of the individual factions. The machinations among elves, medusas, kraul, and other creatures rarely bring any significant improvement to the lives of the swarm's countless members, but often cause disruption and occasionally disaster. Most guild members believe it's best to keep their heads down and stay out of the political conflict and to avoid attracting the disfavor of the Ochran, the guild's order of assassins. More adventurous members might enjoy intrigue and politics, or might unwittingly become tangled up in the schemes of the guild's leaders.

Jarad maintains a council of shamans and rogues to serve as a combination of advisory parliament and spy agency. These high chancellors rarely convene publicly, preferring to disperse themselves throughout the swarm to keep information flowing from the nucleus to every part of the organism.

#### Goals of the Golgari
The Golgari Swarm celebrates the growth and vibrancy of the natural world, but gives equal attention to nature's facets of destruction, decay, and death. It finds allies and agents in the form of fungi, oozes, insects, diseases, and other unsavory aspects of nature, and it uses the power of nature actively toward the goal of advancing its own place in the world. But the Golgari have also learned patience from nature; they are content to work from the shadows, harnessing the energy that comes from decay while the civilization of Ravnica slowly erodes and destroys itself.

The teeming hordes of the Golgari Swarm believe it is finally their time to shine. They have dwelled under the streets and under the sway of the other guilds for too long. They are convinced that Ravnica's institutions are now on the verge of collapse and that the absence of the Living Guildpact proves it. However, the Golgari are neither surprised nor panicked by this, for they believe that all things eventually rot and die, and from this decay, new life blooms. As such, the Golgari see the looming interguild conflict as a necessary final push to bring about a new era—their era.

The Golgari are preparing for upheaval. They have sealed many of the passages leading into the undercity, making their territory seem like an impregnable subterranean fortress. Within it, the Golgari domain retains its grandeur, a mysterious and wondrous kingdom. The rare visitors who stumble into it are awed by its beauty and its aura of ancient power. Palatial architecture fills cavernous sewer chambers, and luminescent spores float through the air to shed an otherworldly light on the moss-covered masonry. Entering Golgari territory feels like stepping into a secret world of dangerous beauty.

> ##### Dark Elves of the Golgari
>Also called the elves of shadow, the Devkarin are one of the three branches of Ravnica's elf race. Like other elves, the Devkarin are adept spellcasters, counting most of the Golgari's shamans among their number.
>
>After being cast out of the nascent Selesnya Conclave millennia ago, the Devkarin found a home amid the corrupted and overgrown places of Ravnica, and the Devkarin necromancer Svogthir became the founder of the Golgari Swarm. Since then, the Devkarin have been a major influence in the guild, even during the times when they didn't hold absolute power. Regardless of who rules the guild, the Devkarin follow the guidance of a high priest, called the matka. The matka's spiritual leadership usually aligns with the guildmaster's temporal commands, but during times when the guild is ruled by a non-elf faction, the matka can be a significant dissenting voice.

### Golgari Characters
**Alignment**: Usually neutral, often evil

**Suggested Races**: Human, elf (dark)

**Suggested Classes**: Druid, fighter, ranger, rogue, wizard

The Golgari Swarm might suit your character if one or more of the following statements are true:

- You're drawn to the darker side of nature or the greener side of necromancy.
- You are drawn to sinister, creepy, or grim characters.
- You like elves and druids but want to explore an unusual direction.

#### Joining the Golgari Swarm
Similar to a **swarm of insects**, the Golgari collectively behave more like a single organism than a scattering of individuals. New members aren't recruited or initiated into the Golgari Swarm; you have been absorbed and incorporated, and the biological system of the swarm funneled you to where your talents are most needed to contribute to the health of the guild. Your position within the guild is defined by your capabilities.

You might act as a shaman of the Golgari if you are a spellcaster—perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Necromancy, a druid of the Circle of the Land, or a druid of the Circle of Spores (described in *chapter 1*). In this revered position, you teach and advise other members of the swarm, keeping them attuned to the natural cycle of death and regrowth. You might manipulate that natural cycle by wielding the magic of death, snuffing out life and reanimating the dead. Or you might wield your magic to spread fungal rot and noxious gases, preparing parts of the city for annexation.

If you aren't adept at magic, the swarm still needs you. Golgari warriors both defend the guild's territory and, when necessary, take offensive action. If you are a fighter (typically of the Champion archetype), you can serve as a shock trooper, perhaps fighting alongside kraul and trolls on behalf of the swarm. If you are a ranger (likely of the Beast Master archetype) or a rogue (of the Thief or Assassin archetype), you are more of a skirmisher. Golgari rangers favor insects and reptiles as companions.

![[032-219.png|right|300]]The Golgari Agent background is available for characters who are part of the Golgari guild.

#### A Golgari Party
An adventuring party drawn from the teeming ranks of the Golgari Swarm might focus on traversing the undercity or on stealthy missions in the streets above. A pair of shamans (a druid and a wizard) would form the core leadership of the group, supported by a warrior (fighter or ranger) and a stealthy member of the Ochran (rogue).

#### Rank and Renown
Every member of the Golgari Swarm has its place, and every role is important to the proper functioning of the guild. Aside from a few leadership positions, the swarm doesn't consider different functions to be more or less important than others. The idea of progressing up the ranks is foreign to the Golgari way of thinking. That said, your renown within the Golgari is a direct measure of the guildmaster's knowledge of you, his confidence in your abilities, and his interest in your activities.

At the start of your career with the Golgari, the guildmaster and his chancellors have no way to distinguish you from the masses of others who perform a similar function. If you receive instructions from the high chancellors, the orders are directed toward you as part of a larger group: for example, "Reclaimers, keep your eyes open for an *Izzet keyrune* believed to be lost in this sector of the sewers."

#### Agent
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Golgari Swarm*

You have distinguished yourself from the mass of your peers. Guildmaster Jarad might not know your name, but he knows that a member of your group is reliable and effective, and his high chancellors single you out for specific missions. The guild provides you with supplies you need to complete those missions (within reason).

#### Monstrous Favors
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Golgari Swarm*

When you reach this level of renown in the Golgari Swarm, Jarad knows your name and appreciates that you can be relied on to help fulfill the guild's objectives. Thanks to this prominence, you can get away with begging a favor from the guild's more monstrous members. You can ask an undercity medusa, a troll, or a kraul death priest to help you with a task that benefits the Golgari Swarm. The creature is not obligated to help you, but it holds you in enough esteem to at least consider it—in exchange for the promise of a favor in return.

In addition, you receive a Golgari charm (described in *chapter 5*) at the start of each mission you undertake on the guild's behalf.

#### Ochran (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Golgari Swarm*

Having achieved considerable renown within the guild, you can choose to become a member of the Ochran. The Ochran often serve as stealthy bodyguards, lurking out of sight until some danger threatens their wards. The Ochran are also sent out as assassins or burglars to further the guild's goals.

#### Advisor
*Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Golgari Swarm*

Although you aren't yet one of Jarad's personal counselors, your value to the guild is clear. The high chancellors regularly call on you to perform tasks for the guild and to share your insights. You can be sure that anything you say to a high chancellor will pass quickly to the ears of the guildmaster.

#### High Chancellor
*Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Golgari Swarm*

Jarad seeks out the most powerful, effective, and loyal members of the Golgari Swarm to serve as his high chancellors. At this point, you certainly qualify. The amorphous nature of Jarad's council means that you don't need to wait for a vacancy to open up; Jarad summons you to his presence, and you are expected to appear and accept the new position offered to you.

As a high chancellor, you advise Jarad in his decision-making, keep him informed of happenings throughout the guild, and convey his instructions to the various parts of the guild's "body."

#### Matka (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Golgari Swarm, elf (dark), spellcasting ability*

You are eligible to fill the role of matka, the high priest of the Golgari elves. You can attain this position only if the previous matka has died or stepped down. Becoming matka requires you to claim the position and maintain your title against any challengers. It isn't unusual for competing claims among would-be matkas to be resolved by combat... or assassination.

As matka, your status among the Devkarin is comparable to that of the guildmaster's. Even high chancellors who are Devkarin attempt to balance their loyalty to Jarad with their loyalty to you.

![[033-220.png|right|300]]

#### Enemies and Allies
The Golgari Swarm shares a general philosophical approach with the other nature-oriented guilds—Simic, Gruul, and Selesnya—in its concern for the forces of life and growth. Under the right circumstances, a member of the Golgari can work well with agents of those organizations. But the Golgari's emphasis on death as part of the life cycle is foreign to those other guilds.

The Golgari prefer to erode their enemies' strength through a process of attrition rather than by launching frontal attacks. If you are called on to take direct action against another guild, it is probably a matter of self-preservation against a guild that is threatening the life and livelihood of the Golgari. You might oppose the Azorius as they attempt to extend their jurisdiction into the undercity or strike back at the Boros to dissuade them from launching more attacks into Golgari territory. Occasionally, you might be assigned to assault the enemies of the Golgari more directly, especially if you are a member of the Ochran. If the death of a particular person or the theft of a key treasure will contribute to the decline and downfall of an enemy guild, even the typically patient Golgari will try to seize that opportunity.

You might ally with members of another guild if they are working—even unwittingly—toward goals you share. The Gruul, for example, are adept at hastening the decay of both humanoid populations and physical structures, even if they remain unaware of their full role in the natural cycle. If some event threatens to upset the balance of nature, such as a necromantic blight that kills all growth or a magical wildfire rampaging through the city, you might join other nature-oriented guilds in an attempt to curtail it and preserve the balance.

> ##### The Golgari View on Other Guilds
>To the Golgari, the other guilds of Ravnica are shortsighted and inevitably doomed to collapse.
>
>- **Azorius** "Such hubris! As if all their laws could shore up this crumbling society. Their regulations and institutions are just detritus in the making."
>- **Boros** "The Boros speak a language we will never understand. Their militant dedication to empty concepts like 'justice' and 'righteousness' is both confusing and disturbing."
>- **Dimir** "They collect information like trinkets, so how can they ever grasp the deeper truths we possess? But their presence in the undercity is an all-too-real threat to our dominion beneath the streets."
>- **Gruul** "The clans serve as effective instruments of the natural cycle, though in their anger, they are blind to the extent of the role they play."
>- **Izzet** "Perplexing. They are attracted to whatever flashes brightest and booms loudest. Their fascination with their toys will only hasten their own end."
>- **Orzhov** "They flout the natural order and use their knowledge of death to resist its pull. While their bodies rot, their spirits persist, clinging to the fiction of material wealth."
>- **Rakdos** "They understand the inevitability of death but seek to hasten its arrival for their petty ends. What the demon destroys, we nurse back to life again."
>- **Selesnya** "Their reverence for nature is the mark of immaturity and naiveté. They fear death, so they can't understand life. They can be dangerous when they fervently cling to their narrow-minded and inadequate view of life."
>- **Simic** "They seek patterns in the natural world, which is commendable enough, but they believe the search will lead them to find perfection through all of its flaws. They strive to move forward but fail to see that the path they tread is cyclical."

## Gruul Clans
![[034-221.png|right|300]]

*Jace had never seen, or for that matter smelled, a Gruul war party at all. Their armor was made from animal hides and bones, and their weaponry was heavy pieces of scavenged city rubbish. Their skin was alive with tattoos, etched with a combination of magic, ink, and, Jace supposed, a considerable amount of pain. Each of them was a hulk of muscle, and Ruric Thar was the largest and mightiest of them all.*— Doug Beyer, *Return to Ravnica: The Secretist*The Gruul Clans are a wild people in a civilized land, a loose affiliation of bands that squat on the fringes of Ravnican society. They shun the centers of civilization, which they see as a source of oppression and weakness, and instead haunt Ravnica's alleyways, abandoned zones, and ruins. They want to see the edifice of civilization torn down so the world can revert to the pure wilderness that thrived before the city grew to cover everything. Then the true order of nature can be restored—an unbridled and brutal state in which only the strong survive and the strongest rule.

In a world covered with city streets and towering buildings, the Gruul are the most out of place, the most ill at ease, and the most eager to topple it all and start fresh. Constant ritualistic warfare reverberates among the clans, every skirmish reinforcing their doctrine of the survival of the fittest. They frequently send sorties into civilized areas to secure goods—and to wreak havoc.

The first leader of the Gruul was Cisarzim, a cyclops who was purportedly the ancestor of **Borborygmos**, the current guildmaster. Cisarzim was called the Lord of Chaos, and his guild's original function as maintainers of Ravnica's natural places meant keeping his faction as remote as possible from the civilized parts of the world. The gradual expansion of the city, however, has driven the Gruul into smaller and smaller refuges.

> ##### Itching for a Fight
>Gruul goblins live in colonies scattered at the edges of Gruul territory and civilized neighborhoods. They fight fiercely when threatened, punctuating their attacks with hisses and growls. When battle fury takes hold of a Gruul raiding group, it typically starts with the goblins, and after the battle, the surviving goblins are still frothing at the mouth and looking for someone to hit.
>

### Inside the Clans
As a collection of disparate clans, the Gruul have no single leader and no headquarters. But the Gruul respect strength and are willing to follow a strong individual who points them in a direction they want to go anyway. For several decades, that position has been held by the mighty cyclops **Borborygmos**, chief of the Burning Tree clan. His nihilistic anger inspires the rest of the Gruul, so when he calls on the other clans to join a raid, they usually agree. Even the fractious Gruul can see the benefit of banding together. The clans sometimes gather at Skarrg, a ruined palace in the rubblebelt adjoining the Tenth District. Here are descriptions of the clans:

**Burning Tree Clan**. The Burning Tree clan is the most fearsome of the Gruul Clans, as well as the largest and most diverse, with branches in several districts of Ravnica. The fear and awe inspired by **Borborygmos** unifies its diverse membership. The Ravnican populace regards the symbol of the Burning Tree clan as the symbol for the entire Gruul guild.

**Ghor Clan**. The Ghor clan is led by an ettin named Ruric Thar (or, perhaps more properly, Ruric and Thar, since the heads claim separate names). Of all the clans, the Ghor carry out the most frequent and savage assaults on Ravnica's citizenry. The clan is known for its audacity in forging encampments close to heavily populated districts.

**Scab Clan**. Members of the Scab clan display scars and body modifications, which they view as expressions of the powerful rage they harbor within themselves. The clan has grown in influence by engulfing or destroying several smaller clans in recent years, but the leader of the Scabs, a corpulent giant known as Narbulg Nine Fingers, has not gone so far as to challenge the Burning Tree clan.

**Slizt Clan**. The Slizt clan is a clutch of sly, skittish warriors, consisting largely of reptilian humanoids called viashino (use the **lizardfolk** stat block in the *Monster Manual* to represent them), along with a few wily humans. This clan survives in the rubblebelts by taking up hiding places in high ground and ambushing its enemies with ranged attacks from above. Other Gruul regard the Slizt as skulkers and cowards, but nonetheless all are cautious when entering areas with elevated ruins. The home ground of the Slizt clan is the Husk, an area at the center of a vast rubblebelt featuring many large, ancient structures that have remained standing for generations.

**Gravel Hide Clan**. The Gravel Hide clan believes that resilience is the truest measure of strength. Though a relatively new group, its members have already earned a reputation (almost certainly exaggerated) for shrugging off devastating attacks. The clan's leader, a hot-tempered goblin named Skorik Boulder Tooth, adorns himself with the shattered remnants of weapons that he has rent to bits with his own jaws.

**Zhur-Taa Clan**. The Zhur-Taa clan advocates an extreme interpretation of the Old Ways. Central to this view is its belief in the imminent awakening of an ancient boar god—Ilharg, the Raze-Boar—who will lay waste to the overcivilized world. Led by a centaur druid called Nikya of the Old Ways, the Zhur-Taa pile up skulls as offerings to this god, and their druids perform guttural chants before and during battle that are said to be in the language of the old gods.

Zhur-Taa druids are adept at summoning and training beasts as war-companions and mounts, and the clan's warriors wade into battle alongside giant boars, other beasts, and even wurms or hydras.

**Bolrac Clan**. The most selective of all the Gruul Clans, the Bolrac clan denies membership to the smaller races. Its members are all enormous, lumbering brutes, primarily cyclopes, ogres, and giants. The clan's leadership changes frequently—sometimes daily, since battles for supremacy are as common as meals. The Bolrac clan specializes in bringing down massive structures using mauls and battering rams. The only thing the Bolrac love more than destroying something smaller than them is toppling, overrunning, and destroying something larger than them.

**Trogs**. Some wandering hermits, known as trogs, find even the company of a clan to be too suffocating, so they spend their days alone in the wild places of Ravnica. These individuals are fierce, independent warriors who traverse the rubblebelts as apex predators. Trogs are notoriously short-tempered and impatient around others. Occasionally, they heed the call of the guildmaster to join in riots or festivals, but more often they conduct their own ceremonies and celebrations in private.

#### Goals of the Gruul
So far as any philosophy can be said to underlie the Gruul way of life, it is about living in the now, with little concern for forethought, planning, or speculation. Impulse drives the actions of the Gruul Clans. They want to live their lives unimpeded, and they lash out when something tries to stand in their way. Emotion and impulsiveness drive them as they seek to do what they want, take what they want, and smash what they want.

### Gruul Characters
**Alignment**: Usually chaotic, often neutral

**Suggested Races**: Human, centaur, goblin, minotaur

**Suggested Classes**: Barbarian, cleric, druid, fighter, ranger

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Gruul Clans if one or more of the following sentences are true:

- You enjoy playing rage-mad barbarians and savage druids.
- You want to throw off the shackles of civilization and indulge your inner beast.
- You like being a force of chaos who keeps things moving in your adventures.

#### Joining the Gruul Clans
You might have been born and raised among the Gruul, like many of the guild's members. Or you could be an outcast, a refugee, or a fugitive from civilized society, shunned for your violent ways or for fleeing the hand of justice. As long as you are strong enough to survive among the Gruul, you are welcome, no matter what secrets haunt your past.

The Gruul "guild" is actually a collection of different, independent clans loosely united under one powerful leader. When you decide to join the Gruul, you join a specific clan, not the guild as a whole. You can roll a d8 or choose from the options in the Gruul Clan Options table to determine your character's clan allegiance.

##### Gruul Clan Options
| d8 | Clan |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Burning Tree clan |
| 2 | Ghor clan |
| 3 | Scab clan |
| 4 | Slizt clan |
| 5 | Gravel Hide clan |
| 6 | Zhur-Taa clan |
| 7 | Minor or new clan |
| 8 | Trog |

The rites of becoming Gruul, whether you have come from outside the guild or are marking your entrance into adulthood, center around being buried alive. When you enter the shallow grave, the person you were before is dead. Your past wrongs and errors are forgotten, but so are your past accomplishments. No matter how well you proved yourself in battle before, when you rise from the earth you are untested. The clan leaders recognize you only when you earn glory in battle as a Gruul.

Most of the Gruul find their place among the fierce warriors of their clans. If you are a fighter, ranger, or barbarian, this is your natural role. Gruul fighters tend to adopt the Champion archetype, Gruul rangers usually adopt the Hunter or the Beast Master archetype, and Gruul barbarians follow either the Path of the Totem Warrior or the Path of the Berserker. Whatever your class, as a Gruul warrior you are devoted to tearing down the edifices of civilization, both physical and institutional. You lash out at a system that you believe is the root of corruption and weakness.

If you are spellcaster, such as a druid (usually of the Circle of the Moon) or a cleric of the Tempest Domain, you might adopt a more spiritual role in your clan. You practice what the Gruul call the Old Ways, a discipline that predates the foundation of civilization on Ravnica, to channel the primal energy that still pulses through the wild places of the world.

![[035-222.png|right|300]]

The Gruul Anarch background is available for characters who are part of the Gruul guild.

#### A Gruul Party
A group of Gruul adventurers can serve as a raiding party to pursue the goals of one clan or the guild as a whole. The combination of anarchs and berserkers (fighters, rangers, and barbarians) with druids of the Old Ways (druids or clerics) creates a powerful mix of muscle and magic. Such a party lacks the capacity for subtlety or stealth, but Gruul missions rarely require such abilities. (A ranger can provide them, in the rare case where they are necessary.)

#### Rank and Renown
![[036-223.png|right|300]]

Renown among the Gruul could also be called glory—when you prove yourself in battle, you earn the respect of your fellows. With glory comes acceptance of your leadership and warriors willing to follow you into battle. The Gruul have no formal holders of titles aside from the chieftains of clans and the guildmaster, but relative status within one's clan is still important.

#### Proven
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in your clan*

With several battles under your belt, you have demonstrated service to your clan and earned the recognition of your peers. You have the right to tattoo your body to commemorate your triumphs in battle and demonstrate your loyalty to the Gruul. You don't yet have authority over others, but when you go into battle with your clan, your fellow warriors fight near you, acknowledging your prowess. Your clan chieftain knows your name and might decide to single you out, offering you an opportunity to prove yourself by performing a special task. Depending on the nature of the task, the chieftain might send 1d4 **anarchs** along to help you.

#### Beast-Friend
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in your clan*

When you reach this level of renown, you develop a rapport with the beasts that haunt the rubblebelts. When you are in a rubblebelt area, you can summon one beast to be your mount: a batterboar (a **giant boar** as described in the *Monster Manual*), a ceratok (using the stat block of a **rhinoceros**), or a raktusk (equivalent to a **giant elk**). It doesn't fight for you unless you have magic or another ability that can control a beast.

In addition, when you carry out a raid on the guild's behalf, a druid of your clan gives you a Gruul charm (described in *chapter 5*) at the start of the raid.

#### Celebrated
*Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in your clan*

You are a hero in your clan, and your reputation extends to other clans as well. You can count on the aid of your clan in most situations. Your clan's druids cast spells for you, and you lead a warband that consists of 3d4 **anarchs** plus three **berserkers** or **ogres** (see the *Monster Manual* for their stat blocks).

Your chieftain keeps an eye on you, aware that you're a potential challenger for leadership of the clan.

#### Chieftain
*Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in your clan*

You can now rightfully challenge your chieftain in single combat for leadership of the clan or take the warriors loyal to you and form a new clan.

#### Enemies and Allies
By standing in opposition to the civilized ways of the other guilds, the Gruul Clans have made it practically impossible to establish alliances with those guilds.

Similar to the Golgari, Selesnya, and Simic, the Gruul respect nature and maintain a close relationship with animals—in the Gruul's case, the monstrous beasts that stalk the rubble and ruins. But the Gruul would just as soon smash the sewers, gardens, and laboratories of those other guilds than cooperate with them in an effort to establish nature as a larger presence within the city.

Because they see all of the remaining guilds as cogs in the vast machine of civilization, the Gruul tailor their tactics toward breaking the machine, rather than directing their attacks at any particular guild. Any guild can be the target of Gruul aggression, as the opportunity arises. The fiercest assaults often come against the guilds that take it upon themselves to combat the Gruul, primarily the Boros and Azorius.

In certain circumstances, such as when some nightmarish horror rears its head in the heart of a rubblebelt, you and your clan could accept the help of members of another guild in putting an end to the danger. Or, when the schemes of other guilds pit one clan against another, there might be some benefit to you and your clan in cooperating with those efforts. But your truest allies are other members of your clan.

> ##### The Gruul View on Other Guilds
>Since every other guild participates to some extent in the establishment and sustenance of the civilization that the Gruul despise, the Gruul look down on all other guilds as soft, corrupt, or downright abhorrent.
>
>- **Azorius** "Civilization is a disease, and the Azorius are its plague bearers. Once they are destroyed, Ravnica will reclaim its primal essence."
>- **Boros** "Puppets who are all too eager to kneel at the feet of their angel handlers."
>- **Dimir** "Skulkers, whisperers, and back-stabbers! They are an infestation of roaches. If they remain in the shadows, they will be crushed beneath the rubble of a city that we bring down on their heads. If they face us in open battle, well, then we'll have a good laugh."
>- **Golgari** "Hermits and under-dwellers. They see that civilization must be brought to its knees, but they just want to replace it with another of their design."
>- **Izzet** "Like us, they respect the powerful. But they seek it in their gadgets and try to contain it in jars."
>- **Orzhov** "The schemers of the Orzhov are the festering wound on a limb that must be hacked away. They amass their power by preying on the weak, so how powerful can they be?"
>- **Rakdos** "The guild of fools. They waste their potential on acts of mockery while the real work of razing the city remains undone."
>- **Selesnya** "The Selesnya would coddle a wolf, teach it to fetch sticks, and call it a dog. We prefer to starve the wolf, let it hunt for its food, and make it a stronger wolf."
>- **Simic** "The Simic enjoy twisting nature, but they will not enjoy it when nature twists back."

## Izzet League
![[038-225.png|right|300]]

*The Izzet mages weren't hard to find. After a couple of days of observation, Jace heard an explosion and saw a startled flight of birds from across the district. The plume of blue smoke was a telltale sign of one of the Izzet's pyrotechnic experiments. Jace tracked the source of the blast and spied two mages, a human and a goblin, outfitted with alchemical gadgetry and mizzium gauntlets. They emerged from a disused tunnel, leaving behind charred bricks and a haze of smoke, and their instruments crackled with energy. From what Jace had gathered, this was the Izzet style of research: keep adding energy until something blows up, then observe the results.*— Doug Beyer, *Return to Ravnica: The Secretist*The Izzet are obsessive experimenters, combining a keen creative intellect with a short attention span. The original mandate of the Izzet guild was to provide solutions for public works projects (sewers, boilers, and roadways), but their increasingly far-fetched experiments satisfy only their insatiable curiosity. Sometimes their experiments yield useful technological advancements; other times they produce unintended mana geysers, spatial rifts, arcane portals, or huge explosions—all of which can be useful in their own way.

The league's most grandiose experiments typically concern public works projects and elemental experimentation. These efforts use a methodology that relies on unexpected outcomes: all results are informative, even if they completely defy expectations. For example, an experiment that begins as the creation of a "hypermana focusing lens" might be renamed a "scram-range teleportal" once the researchers discover more properties of what they have fashioned. Then, after a few goblin volunteers vanish inside it, the apparatus gains the designation of "universal refuse disintegrator"—until the goblin volunteers are discovered alive, having been teleported far from the workshop. This sort of adjustment is par for the course in Izzet experiments; the "fiddle and find out" method is favored over any process of systematic scientific research.

The Izzet League is one of the few guilds whose founder, the dragon **Niv-Mizzet**, remains its guildmaster, just as the guild continues to fulfill its original mission (even as its experiments go far beyond the guild's original mandate).

### Inside the League
**Niv-Mizzet**, the original and current guildmaster of the Izzet League, is a fifteen-thousand-year-old, vain, temperamental, super-intelligent dragon. As he directs experiments throughout the guild, he values results over success, accepting and even anticipating that Izzet experiments will end in gloriously unpredictable ways. However, the dragon rarely concerns himself with the day-to-day running of the guild, preferring to craft long-range plans and let underlings implement the details.

Overseeing the daily operations of the guild is the purview of the Izmundi, a board of directors that assembles teams from among the rank and file of the Izzet League to carry out research according to **Niv-Mizzet**'s directions. The Izmagnus is a smaller board with five to seven members (some members' identities remain secret) who serve as **Niv-Mizzet**'s closest advisors.

The Izzet League is organized into units designated as laboratories that specialize in certain fields of research. Though they all operate under the general guidance of the Izmundi, each laboratory is typically left alone to conduct its research. New fields of study emerge all the time, but the more established laboratories—each populated by hundreds of mages and their attendants—include the following:

The **Laboratory of Pyrology** has a prominent facility in the guildhall, Nivix. Its emphasis is on heat, fire, and explosion.

The **Laboratory of Storms and Electricity** focuses on controlling the weather as well as containing and conducting electrical energy. Its headquarters is in a spire atop Nivix, known as the Lightning Rod.

Research into smelting and forging, most often using the magical metal known as mizzium, is conducted at the **Laboratory of Metallurgy**, which has a small outpost in the Tenth District's Smelting Quarter.

The magical science of transmuting one substance to another is the study of the **Laboratory of Alchemy**.

The **Laboratory of Orientation**, concerned with teleportation and spatial recombination, has multiple workshops that seem to appear and disappear at random.

The **Laboratory of Mimeography** studies means of duplication.

The **Laboratory of Continuism** emphasizes the study of temporal manipulation.

Research into counter-magic and redirection takes place in the **Laboratory of Arcane Geometry**, which has a small presence in Prism University in the Tenth District.

The **Laboratory of Gravitational Inversion** conducts research on means of flight and maintains a workshop near Augustin Station in the Tenth District.

The **Laboratory of Plasma-Dermatology** places emphasis on the combining of opposing elements, with the purpose of creating creatures called weirds.

Izzet laboratories function in a constant state of high energy that propels researchers from one experiment to the next. Some grand-scale experiments draw on the resources of an entire laboratory, while others are a lone visionary's labor of love.

> ##### In the Name of Magical Science!
>Izzet laboratories buzz with creative and often destructive energy, as countless researchers go about their business pushing the boundaries of knowledge. But the lure of discovery is anything but monolithic across the Izzet League.
>
>**Humans**, who make up the majority of the guild's mages, are fueled by limitless curiosity and sustained by their ability to approach any problem from a multitude of different angles.
>
>**Goblins** embody the Izzet's unrestrained enthusiasm for their endeavors. They epitomize the recklessness of Izzet mages, and some participate as subjects in hazardous experiments—even ones of their own devising. More often, they thrive in their role as attendants to researchers.
>
>**Vedalken** tend to be more focused, organized, and astute compared to their Izzet compatriots, and thus they often serve as leaders of projects in the guild's laboratories. Some vedalken are so obsessive about their work that they like to see to every detail themselves, rather than delegating any task to underlings or assistants. This attitude can irritate and alienate their guild mates—and put the vedalken in harm's way when an experiment goes awry.

#### Goals of the Izzet
The Izzet League thirsts for knowledge, cherishes intellect, and speculates about the secrets of the multiverse. It brings to its scientific pursuits a flaming passion that turns its search for knowledge into an insatiable hunger, makes its cold intellect brilliantly fruitful, and widens its speculation into a search for connections between wildly disparate objects or concepts. It is manic in its expressions of creative energy, shifting from careful analysis to intuitive leap seemingly for no reason, always thinking outside the proverbial box. As the Izzet see it, unpredictable action, far from being antithetical to methodical research, has experimental value. In the words of one researcher, "The only action worth taking is one with an unknown outcome."

As Ravnica descends into increasing turmoil, the Izzet have further intensified their frenetic research, though now their efforts are mainly directed toward one outcome: the development of super-weapons. The suspicion that festers in the mind of the Izzet guildmaster, the ancient dragon **Niv-Mizzet**, urges him to push his guild's research toward increasingly dangerous and volatile experimentation.

For the rest of the guild members, the search for bigger and better weapons is mainly an opportunity to engage in all sorts of wild research while abandoning all outward pretense of safety or reason. Much of the guild's laboratory space has been converted into testing grounds that are capable of withstanding great discharges of magical energy.

### Izzet Characters
**Alignment**: Usually chaotic, often neutral

**Suggested Races**: Human, goblin, vedalken

**Suggested Classes**: Fighter, sorcerer, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Izzet League for any of the following reasons:

- You like to make things happen and don't care about the consequences.
- You're drawn to wild magic and dangerous explosions.
- You want to be an innovative genius.
- You relish the madcap high jinks of goblins.

#### Joining the Izzet League
Most Izzet recruits begin their careers as attendants. In the service of a more powerful mage, a crew of up to forty attendants engages in tasks such as recording and organizing information (sometimes under dangerous circumstances), acquiring rare items or elements (usually under dangerous circumstances), or completing experiments (always under dangerous circumstances). Goblins relish this sort of work, while other folk seek promotion into a new position as quickly as possible.

If you are a spellcaster, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, the easiest way up and out of your position is by proving your skill with magic. Most Izzet sorcerers get their magic from the Wild Magic origin, but a few claim a Draconic Bloodline. Izzet wizards tend to specialize in the School of Conjuration, Evocation, or Transmutation. As an Izzet spellcaster, you are probably connected to a particular laboratory, either one described in the "Inside the Izzet" section or a less prominent one focused on a narrower topic. You could be an independent researcher, a functionary devoted to carrying out errands for the guild's leadership, or a coordinator charged with synchronizing the efforts of different laboratories.

Even though the work of the Izzet League is largely focused on magic and research, if you are a more martial-minded character you still have a role to play in the guild. Fighters with the Eldritch Knight archetype often serve as guards, protecting laboratories and the inventions contained within them, or you can aspire to the elite role of scorchbringer (which comes with a flame-throwing magic device called a *pyroconverger*, described in *chapter 5*).

![[040-227.png|right|300]]

The Izzet Engineer background is available for characters who are part of the Izzet guild.

#### An Izzet Party
A party made up entirely of Izzet members might be a mage (wizard or sorcerer) accompanied by guards (fighters) and attendants (any class). The structure of the guild generally assumes that the mage is in charge of steering the group, but it's possible for any of the other characters to be the true brains of the operation. This party lacks healing ability, but alchemist-crafted healing potions can help sustain the party in the absence of a dedicated healer.

![[041-228.png|right|300]]

#### Rank and Renown
Renown within the Izzet League brings with it more responsibility in your chosen field of study, as well as an increasing ability to choose the activities that interest you. This greater responsibility and independence is reflected in a progression of ranks, from that of a mere attendant to a coveted position on the Izmagnus.

#### Rank 1: Researcher
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Izzet League, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

When you have advanced the guild's interests and survived a few magical experiments, you graduate into a position where you can conduct experiments yourself. Only a spellcaster can craft and operate the laboratory equipment involved in Izzet experiments.

As a researcher, you can request equipment for use in your experiments and during adventures. You can secure the aid of 1d4 barely competent attendants to assist you. Your attendants use the **commoner** stat block in the *Monster Manual*.

When you achieve this rank, you can help create your own *mizzium apparatus* (described in *chapter 5*). To do so, you must spend 10 days of downtime in an Izzet workshop, assisting a more experienced researcher in the construction of the device. The apparatus is given to you at the end of this time. If your apparatus is lost or destroyed, you can create a replacement by spending 50 gp and another 10 days of downtime.

#### Scorchbringer (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Izzet League*

Scorchbringers are soldiers assigned to protect Izzet laboratories. As a scorchbringer, you are given a *pyroconverger* (described in *chapter 5*) and are expected to use it in the defense of Izzet property. If your *pyroconverger* is lost or destroyed, you can get a replacement for 50 gp.

#### Rank 2: Supervisor
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Izzet League*

Whether you're an accomplished researcher, a committed soldier, or even a dedicated (and skilled) attendant, you are eligible for promotion to a supervisor position. As a supervisor, you oversee your former peers. Your role is primarily to translate the instructions of the director above you into concrete tasks that the people who report to you can accomplish.

If your director sends you on a mission outside the laboratory, you receive an Izzet charm (described in *chapter 5*) at the start of that mission.

As a supervisor, you earn a salary sufficient to maintain a modest lifestyle.

#### Independent Researcher (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Izzet League, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

Not every researcher chooses to advance through the ranks of management to become a supervisor. As an independent researcher, you can use the resources of your laboratory to conduct any kind of experiment. Assisting you in your research are 2d6 competent attendants (use the **commoner** stat block in the *Monster Manual*, and give them proficiency in the Arcana skill).

In addition, you can create your own Izzet charm (described in *chapter 5*), given 5 days of work and access to your laboratory. When you do so, any other charms you have created vanish.

#### Rank 3: Director
*Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Izzet League*

You oversee a laboratory and all its personnel. In addition, as a director, you are eligible to join the Izmundi, the Izzet board of directors, as a representative of your laboratory. You must have the approval of **Niv-Mizzet**, and a position on this board usually becomes available only if a vacancy opens up. If you assemble your own laboratory, you can be added to the board as an additional member.

It's up to the Izmundi to assemble the correct team to carry out the guildmaster's directives. The Izmundi decides which laboratory should have primary responsibility for any given project, and the director of that laboratory is responsible for assigning people to the team.

Within the bounds of **Niv-Mizzet**'s directives, you have wide latitude in directing the activities of your laboratory. That means you can steer the researchers of your laboratory toward the creation of particular items or effects.

Between adventures, you can maintain yourself at a comfortable lifestyle as a member of the Izmundi.

#### Rank 4: Advisor
*Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the Izzet League*

As one of the most famous members of the guild, you are eligible to join the ranks of the Izmagnus. The decision to include you on this board is solely **Niv-Mizzet**'s. The number of members on the board isn't fixed, so you don't need to wait for a vacancy.

As a member of the Izmagnus, you have the ear of the dragon guildmaster. You can never be fully aware of the scope of his plans, but you know more about them than anyone aside from the other members of the board. The guildmaster listens to your opinion, even though you're not an ancient dragon with thousands of years of accumulated knowledge and wisdom. Ultimately, **Niv-Mizzet** tells you what to do—and you (along with your peers) tell the rest of the guild how to do it.

As a member of the Izmagnus, you can maintain yourself at a wealthy lifestyle between adventures.

#### Enemies and Allies
The Izzet have difficulty relating to the concerns of other guilds. The closest affinity they feel for another guild is their respect for the scientific minds of the Simic—but from the Izzet viewpoint, the Simic efforts lack passion. Conversely, the Izzet can appreciate the passion of the Boros, Gruul, and **Rakdos**, but they don't agree with the goals those passions are directed toward.

The Izzet have a reputation for unprovoked aggression, spurred by the ambition of **Niv-Mizzet**. From your perspective as a guild member, the ancient dragon has a good reason for everything he does. If you are sent to test a new weapon against a suspected Dimir safe house, a Gruul camp, or a deceptively peaceful Selesnya enclave, those must surely be dangerous foes of the Izzet. You are also bound to oppose the Dimir when they steal the secrets of your laboratory's research, the Gruul when they smash the delicate equipment that supports your life's work, and the Boros and the Azorius if they decide that your work presents a danger to the city or breaks some obscure law.

Sometimes members of other guilds can help advance your research, intentionally or otherwise. The Izzet are intelligent enough to recognize their weaknesses, and adventuresome souls from other guilds can offset those weaknesses. The healing spells of Boros clerics can be an invaluable aid, and if a cyclops isn't available to lend its brute strength to your work, a Boros minotaur or a Selesnya centaur can fill the need nicely.

> ##### The Izzet View on Other Guilds
>To the lively intellect of the Izzet, the members of Ravnica's other guilds seem slow, dull, and utterly lacking in the spirit of scientific inquiry and experimentation.
>
>- **Azorius** "The Azorius create regulations for everything, including freedom. What dull, shackled lives they lead."
>- **Boros** "All too often when we're on the verge of setting off a little explosion or a spell that tears a hole in reality, the Boros show up to spoil the fun."
>- **Dimir** "The less we see of the Dimir, the more we know they are monitoring us."
>- **Golgari** "They keep to themselves and clean up our messes. As long as they stay out of sight, it's hard to view them as a threat."
>- **Grull** "They're even better at wrecking our laboratories than we are!"
>- **Orzhov** "Progress means taking risks. But when you gamble with the Orzhov, you always wager more than coin."
>- **Rakdos** "Steer clear of these senseless riot-fiends. Their enthusiasm is best appreciated from a distance."
>- **Selesnya** "These zealots run with beasts and worship figments of the past. They would be wiser to embrace the wonders of the future."
>- **Simic** "The Simic are inventive, but their creations are bereft of soul and fire. They tinker with life but lack the inspiration to breathe true spirit into their inventions."

## Orzhov Syndicate
![[042-229.png|right|300]]

*Representing the Orzhov was a tall, well-dressed noblewoman Jace didn't recognize. The identities of the Orzhov knights around her were concealed by full helmets; instead of faces they bore only the Orzhov's black sunburst symbol. Small, ugly, gray-skinned servant creatures attended to their black capes.*— Doug Beyer, *Return to Ravnica: The Secretist*Wealth is power, and you absolutely *can* take it with you if you're an undying spirit living in decadent luxury on the ruling council of the Orzhov Syndicate. Built on the crushed dreams and broken bodies of citizens deeply indebted to the syndicate's banks and loan sharks, Orzhov's elaborate hierarchy of syndics, priests, and oligarchs exists for the single purpose of funneling wealth to the top. Beneath the twin facades of religious hierarchy and banking operation, Orzhov is an organized crime syndicate with its fingers in businesses across the city.

The Orzhov's original function was both religious and financial, with the two functions closely related. As Ravnica's dominant church, the Orzhov continues to preach an oppressive message that equates sin with debt and promises forgiveness to those who make tithes and donations. As Ravnica's principal bank, it stores and secures the riches of the city, collecting interest at high rates to expand its own wealth. Its members truly believe that their work is necessary to the proper functioning of Ravnica. Although most other Ravnicans see the Orzhov for the corrupt organization it is, many people are still dazzled by the syndicate's promises of wealth, prestige, and longevity.

The Ghost Council, also called the Obzedat, that leads the Orzhov founded the guild and signed the Guildpact, but it isn't clear which members of the original Obzedat might have faded from existence since then and which current members have joined since.

### Inside the Syndicate
The Orzhov are ruled by the iron-fisted Obzedat, a council consisting of the oldest and most powerful undead oligarchs. A vast hierarchy stretches out beneath them, so most of your interactions with the leadership of the guild are with people (or spirits) who occupy the rank just above yours. This hierarchy has corruption in it at every level, and at any time your superiors might be passing instructions down from on high or just using you to pursue their own agendas of greed and ambition.

Orzhov churches and basilicas are scattered across the city, each one led by a ministrant with a staff of knights and syndics. These sites are centers of commerce clothed in the trappings of religion, where lowly borrowers come to seek atonement for their sins—atonement that is given in the form of debt and obligation.

Orzhov attorneys and advokists maintain offices near New Prahv and other Azorius courts. Despite their proximity to law enforcement, these offices are centers of operation for Orzhov protection rackets and other criminal activities.

#### Goals of the Orzhov
The Orzhov Syndicate is dedicated to the quest for power. It sees the value in an organized, structured, law-abiding community, because it is adept at exploiting laws and structures for its own gain. It sees itself, in a perfect world, as the arbiter and enforcer of a social order that keeps everyone in their place and the Orzhov in the highest place.

Increasing tensions in Ravnica have led to an atmosphere of instability, and to counter this, the Orzhov Syndicate promises the trappings of a stable, ordered life amid the chaos—for a price. The Orzhov believe that adherence to hierarchy is the key to success, and they find great comfort in the rigid structure of their guild.

To boost their declining profits in a vacillating economy, the Orzhov have begun offering protection services, promising to shield their "customers" from both physical harm and fiscal disaster. These operations amount to racketeering, bringing with them the underlying threat that those who refuse to pay for protection become targets of the Orzhov's thugs and enforcers.

The Azorius are the greatest threat to Orzhov's operations. In times past, the Orzhov danced along the edges of the law and presented an appearance of legality, but the combination of an ever-expanding legal code and the guild's move into racketeering and other explicitly illegal activities has made it vulnerable to Azorius enforcement. So far, the Azorius have demonstrated more interest in cracking down on the chaotic activity of the Gruul and the **Rakdos**, but Azorius arresters also routinely shut down Orzhov protection rackets and take enforcers into custody. To make matters worse, the Azorius Senate's increasing use of precognitive magic is proving difficult for the Orzhov to work around.

So far, the syndicate's most effective tactic has been to increase the layers of separation between the day-to-day criminal operations of the guild and the leadership, ensuring that no matter how many street-level thugs and syndics are apprehended to fill the Azorius prisons, the guild's leadership remains intact. Contact between the oligarchs and lower-ranking members of the guild is increasingly rare in this situation, and even the pontiffs find it ever more difficult to arrange a hearing with their superiors.

### Orzhov Characters
**Alignment**: Usually lawful, often evil

**Suggested Races**: Human

**Suggested Classes**: Cleric, fighter, rogue, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Orzhov Syndicate if any of the following sentences are true:

- You want to move through the corrupt underbelly of society and make respectable people squirm in your presence.
- You enjoy playing fearsome or decadent characters.
- You want to strive for wealth, lavish beauty, or both.

#### Joining the Orzhov Syndicate
At the beginning of your association with the Orzhov, you are regarded as a borrower. Whether you are the wealthy scion of an oligarch family or a penniless citizen deep in debt to the guild, your status is functionally equivalent: you owe everything you have, even your life, to the Orzhov. Your only hope of improving your status is through your service to the guild. As you acquire renown, you can rise above this debased position in the guild hierarchy. Choose one of three parallel tracks of advancement, depending on your capabilities: advokist, enforcer, or priest.

#### Advokist
If you are a spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Abjuration, Divination, or Enchantment), you can aspire to be an advokist—one of the syndicate's lawyers, with duties that include overseeing contracts, representing clients in Azorius courts, and prosecuting those who fail to pay their debts. Some clerics of the Order Domain also choose to pursue this path.

Many advokists draw on the power of law magic to enforce regulations and contracts to the advantage of the guild. They use their magic to draw out the truth from debtors and those who dare to break their contracts with the guild, to ensure that petitioners approach with the proper humility, and to punish those who offend them or violate their contracts. Some advokists (particularly specialists in the School of Abjuration) also deal in encrypting texts, warding vaults and secret meeting rooms, fortifying structures, and cloaking important personages in magical protections.

#### Enforcer
Enforcers guard Orzhov property and protect the guild's bureaucrats, administrators, and aristocrats. You might be the muscle who collects protection money and debt payments from the syndicate's clients, or an assassin (euphemistically called a euthanist) who brings speedy ends to lives deemed to have gone on too long. Most Orzhov enforcers are fighters. Rogue enforcers typically emulate the Thief or Assassin archetype.

#### Priest
If you are cleric (most likely of the Order Domain), you can aspire to serve an important function in the Orzhov Syndicate, which continues to maintain the outward appearance of a religious institution. Once you earn a position of respect in the syndicate, you will hear confessions and dole out penance (which is always of a financial nature). Your "calling" centers on collecting monetary tithes and offerings in a wide range of forms. Your spellcasting ability comes from the collective power of the spirits that rule the guild, not from a god.

You might even be a most unusual priest for the syndicate—one who thinks the guild's wealth should be used to ease the suffering of the downtrodden. You might also believe in the inspiration and delight that beautiful pageantry can offer to the world. If you seek to distribute wealth and share beauty, rather than hoard them, you must do so discreetly to avoid the ire of the Obzedat.

![[043-230.png|right|300]]

The Orzhov Representative background is available for characters who are part of the Orzhov guild.

#### An Orzhov Party
An Orzhov adventuring party might be assembled in one of two ways. If its primary purpose is the application of brute force, some number of hulking enforcers (fighters) form the core of the ground, perhaps supported by a stealthy "euthanist" (rogue) and a knight (paladin). A priest (cleric) could provide additional magical support.

If the group is more focused on the political scheming of the Orzhov, involving the use of persuasion and coercion rather than outright force, a priest (cleric) and an advokist (wizard) will probably lead the group, accompanied by more sophisticated bodyguards (fighters or rogues).

![[044-231.png|right|300]]

#### Rank and Renown
The Orzhov adhere to a very strict power structure. Positions open only at the bottom of the organization, and rising through the ranks requires utmost devotion. With increasing rank comes a greater degree of leverage over those who occupy the ranks below you.

#### Rank 1: Syndic
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Orzhov Syndicate*

Syndics are low-ranking functionaries. At this level of the hierarchy, you can expect deference from borrowers, who will perform small favors that require no significant risk, effort, or cost. The bulk of your work for the guild, in turn, involves doing favors for those above you.

As a priest of this rank, you can perform minor tasks in an Orzhov church: collecting tithes at the door, scheduling appointments for the senior priests, keeping ledgers, and the like. As an advokist, you copy documents, research legal precedent, depose witnesses, and otherwise assist more senior guild members. As an enforcer, you flex your muscle to collect minor debts that are of little importance to the guild as a whole.

#### Rank 2: Knight
*Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Orzhov Syndicate*

Each knight carries a title that expresses a quality of character, such as Knight of Penance or Knight of Despair. As a knight, you have authority over syndics, and you are trusted—so far as anyone in the Orzhov Syndicate trusts anyone else—to transport large sums of money. You also have access to sufficient funds to maintain a comfortable lifestyle between adventures.

As a priest of this rank, you hear confessions and collect penance, lead rites (and take offerings), perform ceremonies, and offer counsel to your superiors when asked. As an advokist, you represent clients in court, draw up contracts, and put your magic to use in a variety of ways. As an enforcer, you are entrusted with collecting larger sums and interacting with powerful clients.

When you're sent on a mission that poses a potential threat, your superior bestows on you an Orzhov charm (described in *chapter 5*). In addition, you have the authority to demand service from borrowers, including **indentured spirits**. But that's an authority you must use sparingly, since their service counts as credit to their debt, and it's in the guild's interest to keep borrowers in debt.

#### Rank 3: Ministrant
*Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Orzhov Syndicate*

The rank of ministrant is the highest position anyone can hope to attain without being born into the guild. As a ministrant, you study finance, while managing the syndics and knights under your control. Between adventures, you can now maintain a wealthy lifestyle.

You are given a **servitor thrull** that is yours to command. If it is killed, your pontiff gives you a new one at their discretion, possibly up to 1d4 weeks later. You also have a staff of 2d4 knights and 4d8 syndics under your command. You can order them only to carry out tasks that contribute to the work your pontiff assigns to you. The duty of protecting you from physical harm is always appropriate service for your knights, however. Your knights can be **knights** or **priests**, and your syndics are either **nobles** or **acolytes** (stat blocks for them appear in the *Monster Manual*).

#### Rank 4: Pontiff
*Prerequisite: Rank 3 and renown 50 or higher in the Orzhov Syndicate, Orzhov birth*

As a pontiff, you are one of the executive managers in charge of enacting the will of the Ghost Council. For that purpose, you have a staff of 2d6 ministrants (use the **mage** or **priest** stat blocks from the *Monster Manual* to represent them), with their attendant knights and syndics as described for rank 3. You have access to 2d4 **servitor thrulls** and **winged thrulls** at any given time, to carry messages and perform menial tasks for you. You also gain the occasional privilege of speaking with members of the Obzedat. Between adventures, you can maintain an aristocratic lifestyle.

![[045-232.png|right|300]]

#### Enemies and Allies
A syndicate built on a foundation of exploitation and extortion can't rely on alliances. The Orzhov appreciate certain aspects of other guilds' work and missions, but they treat other guilds as resources to be plundered. In general, the Orzhov view guilds that promote order and stability (Azorius, Boros, and Selesnya) more kindly than guilds that sow chaos and destruction (such as Golgari and **Rakdos**).

Sometimes adherence to order can get in the way of an efficient crime operation, though, and that's when the Orzhov part ways with the other law-and-order guilds—especially the Azorius. Any guild that obstructs the Orzhov from amassing more wealth is an enemy, whether the disruption comes from horning in on Orzhov operations or enforcing laws against racketeering.

The best way to secure individual allies from other guilds is to make them owe you something. Borrowers seldom make friendly or especially loyal allies, but they can be useful pawns. You might form a genuine alliance with members of other guilds if you share a common enemy: the overreaching Azorius or Boros, the spies of the Dimir or assassins of the Golgari, or the rampages and excesses of the Gruul and **Rakdos**. Alternatively, you might team up with members of a chaotic guild to bring down an opponent that is causing too much trouble for Orzhov operations.

> ##### The Orzhov View on Other Guilds
>In the eyes of the Orzhov Syndicate, the other guilds primarily represent either opportunities for exploitation or dangerous threats to its way of life.
>
>- **Azorius** "Their new laws challenge everything we know Ravnica stands for. If they will not protect the people, then we will do it for them."
>- **Boros** "Though their structure is reasonable, they are naive in their outlook on justice. What glory is there in risking one's life when work continues in the afterlife?"
>- **Dimir** "It's hard to begrudge them their love of secrets. As long as they stay out of our business, we will leave them be."
>- **Golgari** "Admirably resourceful and elegant, but tragically unhygienic. The swarmers may persist, as long as they don't try to force their aesthetic sensibilities on us."
>- **Grull** "They know nothing of order and dignity, and therefore they serve little purpose as an organization."
>- **Izzet** "Combative and obnoxious. Their allegiance lies with no one, and their naiveté isn't worth our time."
>- **Rakdos** "A necessary source of creativity and satire. Wit is a dangerous weapon, and their critiques speak to the people more than fear and surveillance ever will."
>- **Selesnya** "The Selesnya are idealistic fools. Looking toward nature ignores the problems at hand in the civilized world."
>- **Simic** "Their preoccupation with life disregards the might that death can provide."

## Cult of Rakdos
![[046-246.png|right|300]]

*Jace walked into the **Rakdos** club, pushing into a wall of scents and sounds. The ceilings were surprisingly high inside, draped with banners and spiked chains. An impish creature hooted as it dangled from a high wire while a man in leather chaps swallowed orbs of fire and breathed them back out through his snaggly teeth. Scarred, black-scaled drakes fought viciously in cages that swung from the ceiling, and the stink of sweat and singed flesh wafted from adjoining alcoves. Against the wall stood an enormous sentry, somewhere along the spectrum between rotund man and compact giant, dressed in what looked like the motley of a harlequin jester crossed with barbed wire.*— Doug Beyer, *Return to Ravnica: The Secretist*Tomorrow is an illusion; everything is ridiculous. Members of the Cult of **Rakdos** have witnessed the grandiose speeches and self-important plans of other guilds and concluded that their rivals take themselves far too seriously. Since death comes for everyone, and since order tends inevitably toward chaos, the **Rakdos** believe that unrestrained, moment-to-moment hedonism is the only sane way to live. Of course, few other Ravnicans would describe the **Rakdos** as sane.

The Cult of **Rakdos** bears the name of the demon lord who founded it. As laid out in the Guildpact, the guild was intended to fill roles concerning entertainment, mining, and manual labor. Some argue that any effort to give a demonic cult a respectable role in society was doomed to failure, but the cult remains part of Ravnica's social fabric nevertheless. The Guildpact prohibits the cult's extermination, and its entertainments—even as dark and destructive as they are—hold broad appeal. From rowdy mobs who love to see the **Rakdos** skewer the powerful elites to decadent socialites who come to the **Rakdos** for illicit amusements, most of Ravnica's people don't really want the **Rakdos** to go away, as much as they might publicly protest otherwise.

### Inside the Cult
As one of Ravnica's original guild founders, the demon **Rakdos** has been part of Ravnica for millennia. Members of other guilds know **Rakdos** through his reputation for capricious cruelty and megalomania, but those who join the guild idolize him for his magnetic presence, which inspires art and encourages utter wantonness. Because **Rakdos** finds destruction entertaining, his cultists incorporate deadly acts into their performances in hopes of catching his eye and earning his favor.

Stages for **Rakdos** performances appear on streets and plazas throughout Ravnica every night, and they're gone by morning—carried to and from on the backs of giants. Permanent establishments that cater to dark desires are tucked away in the seediest neighborhoods of the city, such as the Smelting Quarter in Precinct Six of the Tenth District.

#### Goals of the Rakdos
The Cult of **Rakdos** is centered on a demon lord who exemplifies the concepts of chaos and evil. At its worst, the cult is driven by a lust for power, extreme selfishness, and a lack of compassion. Cultists take delight in causing pain to others to make sure they know their place, which is subservient to the powerful adherents of this self-centered philosophy.

The cult's chaotic nature fuels its passion, impulsiveness, and obsession with freedom. A guild of unbridled hedonism, it does what it wants, driven by base desires and a strong streak of cruelty.

The Cult of **Rakdos** was originally recognized as a guild as part of an effort to channel the impulses of demons, giants, ogres, and humans into an acceptable direction. That effort has never been completely successful. Now, as tension builds in Ravnica and several guilds attempt to crack down on chaos and criminal activity, the **Rakdos** cult reacts to this building pressure with increasing violence.

The Cult of **Rakdos** already serves a megalomaniacal demon of chaos, so its members have no interest in seeing any other ambitious figure achieve supreme rulership over Ravnica. They fear that any other guild might gain enough power to overwhelm all the others and impose its own values on everyone. For this reason, they focus their efforts on subverting other guilds' schemes, by undermining popular and powerful leaders and interfering—often violently—with any effort to build a centralized concentration of authority.

The Azorius Senate currently stands as the greatest threat to the **Rakdos** way of life. The cult targets Azorius senators and arresters for ridicule, harassment, and occasionally assassination. The Boros Legion's zealous pursuit of order and justice poses a similar threat. Although Boros's attention is focused on the Gruul at the moment, **Rakdos** cultists are well aware that any sufficiently disruptive performance with a high enough body count could bring the wrath of the legion down on their heads. The overreaching of the Azorius and the self-righteous wrath of the Boros engender true fear in the anarchic **Rakdos** cultists, and the **Rakdos** respond to fear with bloodshed.

![[047-233.jpg|right|300]]

### Rakdos Characters
**Alignment**: Usually chaotic, often evil

**Suggested Races**: Human, goblin

**Suggested Classes**: Barbarian, bard, fighter, warlock

You might enjoy playing a **Rakdos** character if any of the following sentences describe you:

- You enjoy mayhem.
- You like playing showy, dramatic characters who are often the center of attention.
- You're drawn to bards or warlocks.
- The idea of finding a heroic way to participate in a demonic cult sounds like a fun challenge.

#### Joining the Cult of Rakdos
The Cult of **Rakdos** attracts misfits and malcontents, who can't abide the civilized norms of Ravnica, as well as wayward souls eager to idolize an ancient demon lord and partake in riots. However, what Ravnicans like most about the guild is that it has evolved into a roving circus that attracts hedonistic, anything-goes performers who really know how to put on a show.

By the time you start your adventuring career, you no doubt have a great act ready to go, and you're champing at the spike-studded bit to get out there and show the world what you've got. But you must earn a place on the stage or in the ring, and that means first doing your part backstage to keep the show running. "Backstage" can also mean "out in the city," carrying out a variety of errands for people who have more pull than you. And with the **Rakdos**, such errands tend to look more like adventures than like shopping trips.

What does your chosen form of performance look like? What skills do you aspire to learn? Spikewheel acrobats, lampooners, fire jugglers, puppeteers, pain artists, noise musicians, and hellbeast riders form the heart of the cult's bizarre entertainments, putting on shows in guild-owned dark speakeasies and on portable stages in the streets. Performers called uncagers tend—and unleash—the variety of beasts and horrors used in **Rakdos** shows.

Other **Rakdos** performers are spellcasters of spectacular sort, using expressive, free-wheeling, and dangerous magic. These mages find inspiration in the responses expressed by witnesses of their magic. They can be equally gratified by howls of laughter or howls of horror—any attention, in their minds, is good attention.

Most **Rakdos** performers are fighters of the Champion or Eldritch Knight archetype, barbarians of the Path of the Berserker, or rogues of the Thief or Assassin archetype. Spellcasting performers are often bards of the College of Valor or warlocks of the fiend (the demon lord **Rakdos**).

![[049-235.png|right|300]]

The Rakdos Cultist background is available for characters who are part of the **Rakdos** guild.

#### A Rakdos Party
A **Rakdos** adventuring party could operate as a performance troupe, performing a variety of activities under the cover of its nighttime shows. The master of ceremonies (bard) is the public face of the troupe, with a number of performers (fighters, barbarians, rogues, or warlocks) doing their own unique acts. A blood witch (warlock) might take the place of a spellcasting performer or assume the role of the master of ceremonies.

![[050-247.png|right|300]]

#### Rank and Renown
The anarchic nature of the Cult of **Rakdos**—aside from the absolute rulership of **Rakdos** himself—makes rank a meaningless concept to the members of the guild. Nevertheless, renown matters: performers who are well known within the guild also tend to be well known outside the guild, which means larger audiences. Renown in the Cult of **Rakdos** is the difference between being a bit player in someone else's performance and being the ringmaster of your own show.

#### Extra
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos*

You have proven yourself both useful and talented and have earned a place on stage. It's a small place, and a dangerous one—bit players like you are as likely to suffer injury or death during a **Rakdos** performance as audience members are. But that's the thrill of live theater!

#### Sideshow Act
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos*

You have gained a reputation both within the Cult of **Rakdos** and (to some extent) outside it, though you are still a long way from achieving top billing. You might stage performances in back alleys and abandoned warehouses, with a handful of other performers helping to bring your vision to life.

When you go on an adventure, you can call on 1d4 helpers—a mix of **cacklers**, stage hands, or extras—to help you complete it. Use the stat blocks of **cultists** and **thugs** from the *Monster Manual* for the stage hands and extras, respectively.

Your status also means that you can venture into the depths of Rix Maadi, the lair of **Rakdos**, to petition for a Rakdos charm (described in *chapter 5*). **Rakdos** can grant a charm with barely a thought, but your station in the guild doesn't guarantee safe passage to and from the demon's presence.

#### Blood Witch (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos, the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

The aggressive tormentors known as blood witches are the closest thing the Cult of **Rakdos** has to ranking officials. You can't personally mobilize large numbers of guild members, but individual performers, ogres, giants, and even demons are quick to obey your commands as long as they don't contradict the ethos of the guild or the will of **Rakdos** himself.

When you become a blood witch, you are assigned to torment a particular enemy of the guild. This enemy can be an individual, a family, an organization, or even an abstract concept. Examples of blood witches include the Judge of the Judges, who targets the Azorius guildmaster; the Tormentor of the Wojek, who confounds Boros military intelligence efforts; and the Disintegrator of Law and Order, who undermines all efforts to uphold law.

#### Star Performer
*Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos*

At last, you have the opportunity to display your genius to the masses. When you perform, you're the star of the show, the climax of a night of revelry. The rest of the guild regards you with admiration and more than a little envy, since crowds pack whatever venues you choose for your shows. **Rakdos** himself might even come to watch. You can count on the support of your ringmaster, and you can call on the aid of other performers in your troupe—just be careful not to turn your back on the ones who would kill in return for a moment in your spotlight.

You can bring 2d4 **Rakdos** performers (**blade jugglers**, **fire eaters**, or **high-wire acrobats**) and 1d4 **Rakdos lampooners** with you when you're going on stage or heading out to riot on the streets.

#### Ringmaster
*Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Cult of Rakdos*

The show is yours to command. You determine what performers take center stage and when, and you design the exciting and bloody final act of the show—meaning that you decide who lives and who dies. You might adopt an ominous or overwrought title, such as Choreographer of Flame or the Dramaturge. A troupe of 3d10 + 20 **Rakdos** performers (**blade jugglers**, **fire eaters**, or **high-wire acrobats**) is at your service, and you can call on 2d4 **blood witches** to aid you with their magic. You're probably also considered a significant public enemy by the Azorius, but they can't arrest you if they can't catch you.

#### Enemies and Allies
![[051-236.png|right|300]]

A cult of demon worshipers doesn't make a lot of friends. Ideologically, the **Rakdos** have the most in common with the Gruul and the Golgari; all three guilds have a desire to topple the structures of power in Ravnica. Of course, the guilds disagree about what (or who) should replace the existing structures.

Making the powerful look ridiculous lies at the heart of the **Rakdos** performance philosophy. The bulk of the guild's aggression is directed toward guilds that have power and abuse it or guilds that make blatant bids for power. That's particularly true when powerful guilds—especially the Azorius—try to use their power to suppress the **Rakdos**.

Making the ridiculous powerful is the flip side of the **Rakdos** philosophy. Usually, this means elevating the status of the **Rakdos**—and yourself—at the expense of others, but circumstances might lead you to cooperate with members of other guilds in pursuit of a common goal. For example, a power struggle in another guild can be an opportunity for you to install a sympathetic (or ineffectual) leader in that guild. Beyond that, other chaotic guilds have grudges against the law-enforcing guilds and would be happy to join your efforts to strike a blow against them.

> ##### The Rakdos View on Other Guilds
>The Cult of **Rakdos** serves a demon lord who is feared, if not respected, by most citizens of Ravnica. Its cultists express their zeal through riotous, bloody, and deadly performances and revels. To other guilds, they are a fearsome threat to the city. To the **Rakdos**, the other guilds invest too much effort in a vain search for meaning and might.
>
>- **Azorius** "Insufferable killjoys, and every artist's eternal enemy. Everyone thinks we are the guild of ultimate evil, but we're not the ones who want to monitor, legislate, and control your every move."
>- **Boros** "We love a parade, but their demonstrations always come across as stiff. They're the deserving straight man for our every punch line."
>- **Dimir** "They crave secrets, but there's nothing they can get by eavesdropping that we won't freely scream at the top of our lungs. They lurk in the shadows trying to look mysterious, practically inviting our mischief."
>- **Golgari** "We know they're tired of being the downtrodden, misunderstood misfits. If they're truly ready to anger the powers that be rather than lick boot soles, we invite them to run away and join our circus."
>- **Grull** "Our well-meaning cousins in chaos! We want to take society down a peg, and they want to raze civilization to the dirt. That's practically common ground!"
>- **Izzet** "Every performance benefits from prop masters and pyrotechnicians. They can be useful backstage, but they lack the charisma for the spotlight."
>- **Orzhov** "The more the Orzhov try to coerce free people to act against their desires, the easier it is for **Rakdos** to gain recruits."
>- **Selesnya** "Such crowds! They would scarcely notice if they were missing a few by night's end. They'd make the perfect audience, if only they had a better appreciation for bleeding-edge art."
>- **Simic** "Imaginative creators who nevertheless fail to appreciate the meaning of their living creations—nor do they appreciate the tragic irony of not knowing how funny that is."

## Selesnya Conclave
![[052-237.png|right|300]]

*Selesnya troops poured into the streets, emptying the nature temples, wildlife preserves, and other green spaces controlled by the conclave. The centaurs' hooves clattered on the cobblestones and the wolf-riders bounded over stone bridges. Human and elf infantry flooded through the arteries of the district, streaming past intersections and flowing around buildings. Griffons and their riders swooped down out of a blanket of low clouds, strafing past the spires. Emmara rode on the shoulder of a massive creature made of a snarl of marble, wood, and vines, her hand resting on its great head. Two more of the nature behemoths strode ahead of her, swinging their limbs in slow motion, indenting the streets with their footfalls as the other Selesnya troops ran between their legs. Below her, Captain Calomir led the Selesnya army. He rode his white war rhino, driving the Selesnya ranks forward, guiding them through the streets toward the **Rakdos** horde.*— Doug Beyer, *Return to Ravnica: The Secretist*Like a thriving garden, carefully tended and abundantly fertile, the communities of the Selesnya Conclave are a harmonious union of nature and civilization. The members of the conclave dream of embracing all of Ravnica in their peaceful union. In the meantime, they are growing an army, preparing to resist the ambition and destructive impulses of the other guilds and fight to defend their way of life.

At the heart of the Selesnya faith and philosophy is the Worldsoul, called Mat'Selesnya, which its devotees believe to be a manifestation of nature itself. At the signing of the original Guildpact, Mat'Selesnya was embodied in an elemental form and acted as the guild's first guildmaster. The current guildmaster, **Trostani**—three dryads fused together with Mat'Selesnya into a single being—is said to embody the will of the Worldsoul in a similar way. The original mission of the conclave involved conservation and charity, but its focus has long been on expanding its community, in which all members are cared for and nature is preserved in harmony with civilization.

### Inside the Conclave
The Selesnya Conclave is organized into enclaves called vernadi, which are communes built around central trees. The vernadi are smaller versions of the guildhall, the great city-tree Vitu-Ghazi. A dryad, called a voda, is called forth from that central tree to be the leader of the community, connecting the vernadi and its devotees to the Worldsoul and uniting them with the will of the entire conclave.

A voda is accessible to all the guild members in her care. You have regular contact with your voda, who knows your name and has a good idea of your interests, goals, and strengths. And since your voda is mystically linked to the guildmaster, **Trostani**, through communion with the Worldsoul, it's safe to assume that **Trostani** knows who you are as well.

In addition to the voda, military and religious leaders in each vernadi regularly communicate with its members. Ordinary members of the conclave spend a few hours every day training with a military instructor and studying with a religious teacher.

#### Goals of the Selesnya
Despite the growing tensions that now grip the world, in the long view of the Selesnya Conclave, not much has changed. Ravnica is troubled, but Ravnica has always been troubled. The Living Guildpact is absent, but the Guildpact comes and goes. The Worldsoul has not changed, nor has the will of Mat'Selesnya: the conclave's main goal is to grow, as it has always been. Its strength lies in its numbers.

The conclave clings to the ideal of a peaceful collective in which individual desires are subordinate to the good of the whole group. The guild wants to see this beloved community grow, flourish, and thrive in peace. But as much as it values peace within the community, it displays incredible ferocity when that harmony is threatened.

Selesnya's vision is centered on the idea of harmony between civilization and nature. To advance the cause of civilized society, the conclave believes in the need for an ordered structure that orients the group toward the pursuit of the common good. At the same time, the guild's connection with the natural world gives the conclave a fervent appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things. Selesnya doesn't tolerate selfishness or ambition, instead urging its members to put the needs of others ahead of their own desires and to use the power of nature—including nature's wrath—to drive away those whose selfishness threatens the coherence of the group.

The greatest danger that Selesnya faces lies in the ambitions of other guilds, which are flourishing in the absence of the Guildpact. Selesnya's way of curbing this grasping selfishness has always been to outnumber the other guilds. Its members aren't naive; they fully realize that the ambitions of other guilds will lead to violence. And they aim to be prepared for that violence when it erupts.

"For my seedlings to survive," Mat'Selesnya says, "we must grow an army capable of overwhelming such ambitions." Some of that army is literally grown, in the case of plant creatures and elementals. A great many members grow up in the guild from childhood and learn their martial skills at the guild's training grounds. And still more join the guild through recruitment—especially in these troubling times, when rumors of war and a sense of imminent doom make Selesnya's message of harmonious community sound ever more appealing.

### Selesnya Characters
![[053-238.png|right|300]]

**Alignment**: Usually good, often neutral

**Suggested Races**: Human, centaur, elf (wood), half-elf, loxodon

**Suggested Classes**: Bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, warlock

You might enjoy playing a Selesnya Conclave character if one or more of the following statements are true:

- You like the idea of being part of a huge, peaceful community.
- You like playing druids, rangers, or spiritual monks.
- You believe in victory through respectful teamwork, overwhelming numbers, or both.
- You want a spiritual connection to something bigger than just your character.

#### Joining the Selesnya Conclave
New initiates come to the Selesnya Conclave as children, to be brought up by the guild's members, or as recruits drawn from the guildless or the membership of other guilds. Regardless of the path you took to get here, you start out in the role of initiate. As an initiate, you must subsume your desires to the needs of the guild while finding a way (under the guidance of your enclave's leader) to put your talents to use in service to Mat'Selesnya. This effort isn't so much a process of carrying out orders, but of gradually discerning the will of the Worldsoul and finding your place in it.

In your search for communion with the Worldsoul, you are part of a worldwide community, but you are also part of a smaller local community—an enclave called a vernadi, which is led by a dryad called a voda. Your role in the conclave is specifically oriented toward your vernadi, at least at the start of your career. Your voda helps you in your process of discerning the will of Mat'Selesnya and your place in relation to it.

The Selesnya Conclave is both a community of worshipers and a militia, and thus its leadership includes both military and religious figures.

#### Military Roles
Selesnya looks from the outside like a peaceful community, but it is also an army. If you are a fighter, a ranger, or a paladin (usually having sworn the Oath of the Ancients), your place in the guild is a military one. Unlike in the Boros Legion, though, the conclave's military ranks aren't highly structured; each enclave has its own forces, with a single commander and one other layer of command (at most) above the troops. A variety of special military roles become available to you as you prove yourself useful to your vernadi and the conclave. You might aspire to be a votary standing watch over the temple gardens, a sagittar archer, a pegasus-riding equenaut, or a wolf-riding Ledev guardian.

#### Religious Roles
If you are a druid (perhaps of the Circle of the Land), a cleric (of the Life or the Nature Domain), a warlock with the Archfey (Mat'Selesnya) as a patron, or a devout monk (who might follow the Way of the Open Hand), you might be drawn to a role of religious leadership. These leaders mediate the relationship between the members of the conclave and the voice of Mat'Selesnya. A number of special roles will be available to you as you establish your place. You might hope to carry the message of the conclave out into the world as an evangel, and great religious leaders are honored with the title of hierarch.

![[055-240.png|right|300]]

The Selesnya Initiate background is available for characters who are part of the Selesnya guild.

#### A Selesnya Party
An adventuring party is a community in itself, a symbiotic group in which each individual contributes to the success of the whole. A fighter, a ranger, or a paladin provides a starting point of martial might. A druid or a cleric offers support and healing. A bard or a warlock gives additional spell support. A monk, a bard, or a ranger can add some measure of stealth and skill specialties. Such a group is well equipped to help Selesnya grow—and to smite the guild's enemies.

#### Rank and Renown
The Selesnya Conclave doesn't classify its members in a rigid hierarchy, because doing that would encourage individuals to seek to rise above the rest of the community and put their desires above the good of the whole. Thus, aside from the leadership of **Trostani** over the whole guild, and each voda over her vernadi, the members of the conclave are distinguished mainly by the diverse roles they fill instead of by rank or status.

Indeed, many Selesnya initiates never leave that basic role. They have discerned their purpose, and it is to live a proper life in support of the conclave, without pursuing any kind of prestigious role. But if you achieve greater renown in the guild, a variety of special roles become available to you.

Regardless of renown and role, members of the conclave don't earn salaries. The guild cares for its own, however, and every member can live in a vernadi at the equivalent of a modest lifestyle.

#### Evangel (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave*

Evangels extend their hands to potential converts and welcome new initiates into the life of the Selesnya Conclave. They include fervent preachers who speak the will of the Worldsoul in the promenades and marketplaces, humble missionaries who serve among the poor in the darkest districts of the city, and even centaur warriors who evangelize in Gruul territories where words of war speak louder than prayers of peace.

When you become an evangel, you gain one additional contact from a guild other than the Selesnya Conclave, which can be someone you have met in your adventures or chosen from the Non-Selesnya Contacts table earlier in this section. In your new role, you belong to a vernadi and can expect help and support from that community, but you spend your time away from it, operating with a great deal of independence. When you return to your vernadi, you teach and train new initiates.

#### Votary (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, proficiency with martial weapons*

Votaries are soldiers who protect the vernadi gardens in the area immediately around its central tree. As a votary, you are usually assigned to guard duty, but your voda might also assign you to special missions that require strength of arms.

While you are in the garden you're sworn to protect, the plants obey your word, allowing you to transform the foliage into 1d6 **awakened shrubs** or 1 **awakened tree** (both described in the *Monster Manual*) for as long as a threat to the garden persists. These awakened plants won't leave the garden.

#### Sagittar (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, proficiency with the longbow*

Sagittars are archers who defend key guild locations, including the guildhall at Vitu-Ghazi. Their range and accuracy are so great that a common saying has arisen among Ravnicans: "Sagittars aim their bows using maps." If a conclave mission would benefit from the support of disciplined archers, **Trostani** herself might call on sagittars to render aid.

As a sagittar, you never have to want for arrows; the guild provides arrows to you at no cost.

#### Selesnya Charm
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave*

You can request that the voda of your vernadi bestow a Selesnya charm (described in *chapter 5*) on you before you undertake any mission on the guild's behalf.

#### Equenaut (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, proficiency in Animal Handling*

Equenauts are knights who ride pegasi and serve as warriors and scouts. In addition to surveilling enemy forces and terrain, they are also on the lookout for places where a new vernadi can take root. As an equenaut, you are sometimes called on to take part in military activity, but you are free to pursue your vision of how to serve Mat'Selesnya—from the back of your **pegasus** mount (see the stat block in the *Monster Manual*).

Your mount effectively belongs to you, entrusted to your care. If it comes to harm through your negligence or mistreatment, you might be punished—perhaps to the extent of losing your position as an equenaut.

#### Hierarch (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

The ranks of the Selesnya clergy aren't hierarchical, yet you are honored with the title of hierarch. Hierarchs lead rites that invoke the blessing of Mat'Selesnya, bringing Selesnya's initiates into closer communion with the Worldsoul and with each other. They are assisted in these rites by less experienced clergy.

As a hierarch, you can call on the aid of 1d4 **acolytes** (see the stat block in the *Monster Manual*), even leading them on missions.

You have an important voice in decision-making for your vernadi, and you are expected to offer advice and opinions to your voda when requested.

Your position within the guild and your vernadi gives you access to superior food and lodging, the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

#### Ledev Guardian (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 25 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave, 10th level or higher*

The Ledev guardians are knights who were originally protectors of Ravnica's roadways but now serve the Selesnya as champions. Their ranks include a number of centaurs. The humanoids among them ride dire wolves, which they raise from pups to forge close bonds between rider and mount. If you have a **dire wolf** mount, it effectively belongs to you (see the *Monster Manual* for the stat block).

#### Dignitary (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Selesnya Conclave*

Chosen by **Trostani** herself, dignitaries act as emissaries in dealing with other guilds. As a dignitary, you must be available when **Trostani** has need of your service, but you have great latitude to pursue your vision of the guild's goals. You can call on 10d10 Selesnya initiates to support you in your missions for **Trostani**, and 8d10 initiates for a mission of your own devising. These initiates are **acolytes**, **scouts** (both described in the *Monster Manual*), or **soldiers**.

Your position gives you access to the best food and lodging, the equivalent of a wealthy lifestyle.

#### Enemies and Allies
The Selesnya philosophy is one that embraces all of Ravnica. Everyone is a potential ally, until the moment they demonstrate their hostility to the conclave or the will of the Worldsoul. The Selesnya have difficulty with the riotous **Rakdos**, the sinister Dimir, and the chaotic Izzet, but their focus on ordered community and verdant nature gives them some amount of common ground with every other guild.

Any guild can become an enemy of the conclave, though, if its guildmaster's ambitions—or rogue agents within the guild—upset the balance of power on Ravnica. From the other side, many other guilds see the Selesnya as a quiet threat and seek to diminish its strength before its numbers grow out of control, so as a member of the conclave you are duty-bound to oppose their operations of sabotage. The wanton plunder of Ravnica's natural resources can also provoke the Selesnya to take action.

When members of other guilds pursue noble aims—promoting peace, strengthening community, and opposing other guilds' efforts to expand—they act as allies of the conclave and thus your allies. Furthermore, they are potential recruits into the fold, since they have demonstrated their sympathy for Selesnya's goals and their value to the community.

> ##### The Selesnya View on Other Guilds
>In the Selesnya vision of a perfect Ravnica, the guilds would be abolished and all people would live in harmony with nature and each other. Until such a vision comes to pass, the conclave judges the other guilds against that standard of perfection.
>
>- **Azorius** "All their laws are meant to create a semblance of the unity that binds us already. If they would only be still and listen to the voice of Mat'Selesnya."
>- **Boros** "Sooner or later they will tire of their fighting, and when they do, the gentle embrace of the Selesnya will be waiting for them."
>- **Dimir** "Just as they hide from the light and cling to the shadows, they hide from life and cling to secrets. They see everything as a scheme, everyone a tool, instead of recognizing the power of unity and mutual growth."
>- **Golgari** "They wallow in filth and rot, too preoccupied with death to appreciate the bliss of life's connections."
>- **Grull** "They are a desperate echo of what they should be, reaching blindly toward something greater. Such a waste. And a smelly, unreasonable, destructive one at that."
>- **Izzet** "The path to unity doesn't lie in the oppressive control of a massive ego like the dragon's. The Izzet can tinker and meddle all they like, but they are doomed to failure."
>- **Orzhov** "An endless stream of grasping hands, reaching for more and more, pursuing their individual ambitions at all costs—even from beyond the grave."
>- **Rakdos** "They laugh at tragedy and wallow in pain. Eventually, they will submit to Mat'Selesnya. Until then, they must be contained."
>- **Simic** "They chart a twisted course of warping and mangling life and nature. Yes, we must grow and adapt, but nature will take its own time in completing that task."

## Simic Combine
![[057-242.png|right|300]]

*The Simic representative was a stern-looking mage whose parentage appeared to be partly human and partly aquatic, possibly merfolk; he rode astride a creature that seemed the offspring of a giant, blue-carapaced crab and an irate squid. The Simic squad was rounded out by a host of mages clad in scale armor, and improbable hybrid fusions of scaled, finned, and shelled creatures.*— Doug Beyer, *Return to Ravnica: The Secretist*The secrets of life are revealed in the laboratories of the Simic, and their research notes plumb and catalog nature's wonders. Their original mission was to oversee issues of public health, but the Simic came to believe that complete health—of individuals and of society as a whole—depends on the mutual adaptation of nature and civilization to one another. Thus, biological experimentation has always been among its primary concerns.

Historically, the guild's approach to its mission has been one of incremental progress toward a utopian ideal of thriving biology, and it remains more aloof from politics than other guilds. Its fundamental mission remains unchanged by the current political instability, and the isolation of its laboratories protects most Simic guild members from immediate harm.

Little is known about the combine's founder, except that this individual's first or family name was Simic.

### Inside the Combine
Vast sinkholes called zonots are the primary geographic divisions among the Simic. Each zonot pierces layer upon layer of crumbled city as it descends deep below the surface and connects to ancient, long-forgotten ocean waters. A zonot is a distinct Simic habitat with its own culture and ecosystem, as well as a leader called a Speaker. The Speakers of all nine zonots form the Speakers' Chamber, and they elect a Prime Speaker from among them to serve as the Simic guildmaster. **Zegana**, the current Prime Speaker, is the Speaker of Zonot One, which is located in a remote, sparsely inhabited part of Ravnica far from the political activity of the Tenth District.

The Simic guildhall, Zameck, is located in Zonot Seven within Precinct Five of Ravnica's Tenth District. A huge chamber just below the street serves as the gathering place for all the Speakers, as well as a location where non-Simic visitors can meet with the Prime Speaker or other combine emissaries.

#### Goals of the Simic
Two philosophical principles, in tension with each other, combine to give the Simic Combine its unique approach to science and nature. In traditional Simic thought, these principles are called the Holdfast and the Upwelling.

The Holdfast principle, named for the biological mechanism that keeps kelp and sponges anchored to the sea floor, advises members of the Simic Combine never to stray so far from nature that they become "adrift." It espouses the idea that nature left undisturbed will evolve toward adaptive traits and increased strength. Nature will flourish and grow, and every creature will find its proper niche in the ecosystem where it can thrive.

The Upwelling principle, named for the phenomenon of nutrient-rich water rising to the ocean surface, advocates that the new and enlivened should replace the old and depleted in an unending cycle, bringing constant refreshment and renewal. This principle accounts for the combine's analytical bent and its emphasis on knowledge as a means of transformation. Learning the secrets of the universe lets you shape the world as you desire. The Upwelling encourages every creature to discover its full potential.

![[058-243.png|right|300]]

The Holdfast encourages the Simic to promote nature; the Upwelling urges them to perfect nature. The end result is the same: a hastened system of evolution that brings out the best in every creature's nature. But different factions within the Simic Combine interpret these principles in their own ways.

The leadership of the Simic Combine represents the traditional philosophy of the Utopians. Their vision is of an ideal world in which nature and civilization exist in balance, in which natural life adapts to life in the midst of modern civilization and the civilized world adapts to accommodate these creatures. Utopians generally interpret the Holdfast principle as being about staying rooted in nature, and the Upwelling as concerned with slow, predictable, cyclical improvement. So they remain hidden in their subaquatic laboratories, pursuing their research while isolated from the volatile interrelationships among the other guilds. Prime Speaker **Zegana** encourages that isolationist attitude.

At the same time, a growing faction within the Simic believes that an all-out war among the guilds is inevitable, given the growing unrest in the city. These members, the Adaptationists, believe that the guilds exist in a fragile ecosystem in which the slightest imbalance can have cascading effects. With an absent Living Guildpact failing to maintain the balance, only catastrophe can result. The Simic must change in order to survive, and slow, small steps in pursuit of an ideal vision aren't enough. The future of the guild is in imminent danger, and the Simic need to focus on survival. Adaptationists tend to interpret the Holdfast as being about defense and security, and the Upwelling as a call for sudden, disruptive growth.

As befits members of a guild of scientists, the Adaptationists' preparations for war include the creation of soldiers that are magically and biologically adapted. The Guardian Project has yielded hybrids that combine human, elf, or vedalken stock with the characteristics of crabs, fish, jellyfish, and a variety of other creatures to give them natural armor and weapons, gills, venomous stings, and other combat-focused adaptations.

### Simic Characters
**Alignment**: Usually neutral

**Suggested Races**: Human, elf (high), Simic hybrid, vedalken

**Suggested Classes**: Druid, fighter, monk, wizard

You might enjoy playing a character who belongs to the Simic Combine if one or more of the following statements are true:

- You are drawn to the image of the mad scientist tinkering with the fundamental forces of life.
- You like playing curious wizards, druids, or mutants.
- Prying into secrets and mysteries inspires your curiosity.
- You want to make the world a better place through research.

#### Joining the Simic Combine
Many paths lead people to the Simic Combine, all of them guided by the notion that tomorrow can be made better than today. All of the guild's efforts strive to achieve a utopian future that they believe is within reach. When you join the Simic, choose one of the following roles for your character.

#### Scientist
If you are a spellcaster such as a wizard or a druid, you can find a natural home among the Simic as a scientist, magically manipulating the forces of life and nature to shift the world toward the guild's utopian ideal. Most Simic wizards specialize in the School of Transmutation, using their magic to alter living creatures or alter the natural environment. Simic druids often choose the Circle of the Land, putting similar magic to the guild's service. Those who focus on manipulating life forms are known as biomancers, while those who focus on water, weather, and atmospheric conditions are called terraformers, but you can choose your own path of research.

#### Guardian
If you are playing a Simic hybrid, you initially became involved in Simic research as a test subject in the Guardian Project. You volunteered to participate, but it's possible there was some pressure on you, or you viewed it as the only way to be accepted in the guild. Your biological modifications make you ideally suited to specific tasks, and you might come to operate as a spy, an infiltrator, or brute muscle. Good class options include fighter or rogue (of any archetype), or a monk of the Way of the Open Hand.

#### Deepsage
You might instead choose an ascetic, contemplative life as a deepsage (perhaps as a wizard or monk). You would devote yourself to meditating on the philosophical principles of the Holdfast and the Upwelling, a pair of complementary ideas that describe the Simic approach to nature and the city. Deepsages inscribe short philosophical riddles, bordering on paradoxes, into shells, exoskeletons, and stones, and Simic guild members reflect on these sayings to advance their understanding of the combine's role in the world. Deepsage wizards typically specialize in the School of Conjuration, and deepsage monks follow the Way of the Four Elements (focusing on air and water over the other two elements).

![[059-244.png|right|300]]

The Simic Scientist background is available for characters who are part of the Simic guild.

#### A Simic Party
An adventuring party drawn from the ranks of the Simic is typically formed around the nucleus of one or two mages, perhaps a biomancer (wizard) or a terraformer (druid). They might be accompanied by a soldier (probably a Simic hybrid fighter) and a deepsage (monk).

#### Rank and Renown
Tiers of responsibility and importance—functional ranks—create a hierarchy among the scientists of the Simic Combine. A scientist's course of advancement is the path of increasing responsibility within a clade or project. Guardians and deepsages have more limited opportunities for advancement, though they still gain the benefits of high renown scores.

#### Rank 1: Technician
*Prerequisite: Renown 3 or higher in the Simic Combine, Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

As a technician, you can begin performing experiments, following the instructions of a researcher as you operate instruments, care for experimental subjects, extract samples of bodily fluids, and run errands up and down the zonot and out into the city. Such errands can bring you into contact with members of other guilds and lead to adventures.

If you have any kind of pet, familiar, mount, or animal companion, you can add one random adaptation to it from the Minor Adaptations table. Doing so requires 1d6 days of work (8 hours per day) for each creature, and the work must be done in a Simicfacility.

![[060-245.png|right|300]]

#### Rank 2: Researcher
*Prerequisite: Rank 1 and renown 10 or higher in the Simic Combine*

After doing your time as a technician, you are eligible to lead your own experiments. You must be associated with a clade or a project, and must work on experiments related to its primary focus under the general guidance of the clade or project leader. Project leaders are more hands-on, ensuring that your research contributes to reaching the immediate objective. Clade leaders check in from time to time, but they give you wide latitude to pursue your own experiments under the general aegis of the clade's interests.

If your research requires it, your project leader or clade leader can equip you with a Simic charm (described in *chapter 5*) before you undertake a mission or an experiment. In addition, you can call on a **category 1 krasis** to assist you on any mission authorized by the guild. You choose the krasis's two adaptations.

#### Luminary (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 10 or higher in the Simic Combine*

As a guardian, deepsage, or other non-scientist within the Simic, you don't progress through ranks, but as a luminary you might be entrusted with the leadership of guerrilla or espionage missions, with other Simic hybrid agents under your command. Or you might be respected as a wise and enlightened teacher.

If your work for the guild requires it, a project leader, clade leader, or other superior can equip you with a Simic charm (described in *chapter 5*) before you undertake a mission or an experiment on the guild's behalf.

In addition, when you're on guild business, you can call on the following Simic hybrid agents to assist you: one **hybrid brute** or **hybrid flier**, up to two **hybrid poisoners** or **hybrid shockers**, or 1d4 **hybrid spies**.

#### Rank 3: Project Leader
*Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 25 or higher in the Simic Combine*

A proven researcher, you are eligible to oversee your own project, directing the efforts of other researchers toward the solution of some problem facing the guild. The Speaker of your zonot gives you laboratory space, and you have a staff of 3d12 researchers (which use the stat blocks of **commoners** or **merfolk** from the *Monster Manual*). You can have this staff work on projects for you, which can include the creation of a **category 2 krasis** (with minor or major adaptations of your choosing, which you can then bring outside the laboratory on important business, ideally under carefully controlled conditions.

Hosting the work of a successful and important project reflects well on the Speaker of a zonot, so your Speaker keeps a close eye on your work. On the positive side, you can count on access to the considerable resources of the zonot as long as your research is going well. On the other hand, you can expect your Speaker to try to meddle in your work to ensure that your efforts remain relevant to the overall goals of the Simic Combine.

#### Rank 4: Clade Leader
*Prerequisite: Rank 2 and renown 50 or higher in the Simic Combine*

As a famous researcher or a successful project leader, you stand ready to take on a supervisory role for an entire clade. New clades rarely form, so you must wait for your clade leader to retire (one way or another) before a position exists for you to fill, except in truly exceptional circumstances. Similar to a project leader, you are responsible for directing the efforts of researchers exploring a wide variety of projects related to the focus of your clade. Unless an experiment turns out to be especially interesting, these efforts can carry on without your supervision. If you need to, you can enlist the aid of 5d12 researchers (which use the stat blocks of **commoners** or **merfolk** from the *Monster Manual*), and you can also request the support of hybrids, krasis, or any other creature associated with the Simic Combine (see the list in *chapter 6*) from the Speaker of any zonot where the members of your clade live and work.

Because most clades span multiple zonots, you have status equal to the Speakers of the zonots. You have no voice on the Speakers' Chamber, unless you can persuade one or more of its members to speak on your behalf.

#### Speaker (Special Role)
*Prerequisite: Renown 50 or higher in the Simic Combine*

You are eligible to become the Speaker of a zonot. The selection of a new Speaker (in the event of an existing Speaker's retiring, dying, or otherwise leaving the position) takes place through a combination of popular election and the input of the other eight Speakers, with the current Prime Speaker having the final word. If you emerge as the victor after this rigorous process, you assume the leadership of your zonot and are empowered to bring its concerns before the Speakers' Chamber.

You are a political leader rather than a scientific one, so you have authority over other members of the combine only if they live and work in your zonot. If a clade has a laboratory in your zonot, you have the right (and responsibility) to supervise its activities to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, but not to interfere in its research beyond that point. And if the clade leader lives in a different zonot, you have no authority whatsoever over that person.

#### Enemies and Allies
The Simic Combine has an affinity for guilds that care for the forces of nature, and as such it has worked alongside the Selesnya, Gruul, and Golgari in the past. To a lesser extent, the combine also has a rapport with the other scientific guild, the Izzet. But overall, the Simic attitude toward other guilds is one of healthy caution bolstered by a general tendency toward isolation.

Any guild could break the peace and send the entire world spiraling into war, so all the guilds are potential enemies—particularly if they direct their aggression at the Simic Combine. The Golgari Swarm has launched a direct attack against Zonot Four (located in the Sixth District), and they could expand that attack to other zonots at any time. Azorius arresters are prying into all the zonots, looking for evidence of wrongdoing. Thus, the Simic efforts at preparing for war are in danger, and the need for those efforts to be brought to fruition could arise at any time.

Your most obvious allies are those who seek to restrain the ambition of other guilds and maintain the balance of power. At various times, that category could include members of any other guild, particularly the Selesnya Conclave. Everyone (with the possible exception of the chaotic **Rakdos** and Gruul) has an occasional interest in maintaining the status quo, no matter how revolutionary that notion might seem at other times.

> ##### The Simic View on Other Guilds
>The most insular members of the Simic Combine avoid interacting with other guilds entirely. No one but another Simic scientist could ever fully grasp or appreciate the work of the guild, and too many of the other guilds react with fear to what they don't understand.
>
>- **Azorius** "An absurd and inelegant construct, forever trapped in a maze of their own making. They would outlaw evolution if they could. And if any of them truly seek utopia, the rest are far too busy shuffling papers to notice. Avoid their attention at all costs."
>- **Boros** "They style themselves the agents of 'justice.' But the law is no better excuse for aggression than any other."
>- **Dimir** "We need not compete. Let them be, and they will let us be—but observe them closely."
>- **Golgari** "Less an organization than an infestation. They are nearly as adaptable as we are, and they seem intent on competition. More than any other guild, they pressure us to improve."
>- **Grull** "The Gruul conceive of nature only in terms of savagery and privation. But their ways are no less a response to civilization than our own. They will survive, barely, and perhaps one day they will understand."
>- **Izzet** "The Izzet have spent ten thousand years mimicking the appearance of research, producing more pyrotechnics than progress. Surely that is a performance to rival the **Rakdos**."
>- **Orzhov** "They hoard their treasure throughout their pointless lives and lengthy afterlives. With such riches, we could swiftly bring about a future in which gold is as irrelevant as death."
>- **Rakdos** "Camouflage, mimicry, resilience, and versatility. If the guilds were species, we would count the **Rakdos** among the most impressive. But they aren't, and that makes the **Rakdos** far more erratic—and dangerous."
>- **Selesnya** "Like us, they seek a synthesis between 'natural' and 'artificial' systems. Unlike us, they wish to achieve it by unconditional surrender. They are adequate partners in stable times, but in the present climate they have little to offer."

# Chapter 3: The Tenth District
![[061-301.jpg|right|300]]

The Tenth District is a sprawling place. To be governed effectively, it is broken into six precincts, each the size of a small city. This chapter describes the various features you can find in those wondrous places.

## The Six Precincts
Each precinct, as well as its distinct personality, is explored in its own section later in this chapter. Here are brief descriptions of each of them to help orient you before your tour:

**Precinct One**. This is the hub of the wealthy and powerful, where courtly games and espionage play out among visitors gawking at the impressive architecture. The precinct is also known as the Guildpact Precinct.

**Precinct Two**. Many professionals live here in clean and orderly neighborhoods, in the shadow of New Prahv, while mob bosses coerce residents in order to enrich themselves and influence local politics.

**Precinct Three**. In the Greenbelt, nature has encroached into the urban environment to varying degrees, and folk here provide bountiful sustenance and domesticated beasts for most of the district.

**Precinct Four**. Constantly in a state of turmoil, the scarred streets of Precinct Four are a proving ground for soldiers and marauders alike. Visitors here had best be spoiling for a fight.

**Precinct Five**. Precinct Five is where the learned folk of the Tenth District gather to discuss theory or to put their knowledge to practical use in the precinct's many schools, libraries, and laboratories.

**Precinct Six**. In the hardscrabble neighborhoods of Precinct Six, the working folk eke out a living by toiling at warehouses, docks, and factories controlled by callous employers. When night comes, the residents hide indoors to avoid becoming prey to creatures that stalk the darkness.

### People and Rumors
Each precinct's section includes two tables that can help you, as DM, improvise as characters explore that part of the city.

When a character wants to talk to a person on the street, you can roll on the People on the Street table for the precinct. Unless otherwise noted, these NPCs can be of any race. They might use the *Monster Manual* stat blocks for **commoners**, **guards**, or other creatures, at your discretion.

Whenever characters are gathering information or talking with contacts in a precinct, you can use the Rumors table for the precinct to add some flavor to their interactions or to generate adventure hooks.

![[062-302.png|right|300]]

## Major Trade Ways
Two major avenues run across the whole Tenth District, crossing precinct lines.

**Tin Street** is the longest thoroughfare in the city, a vital center of trade, and a hub of activity day and night. In addition to its shopping attractions, Tin Street is also a popular spot for nightlife, with its many restaurants and theaters. Much of the street runs through the western part of Precinct Four, and other parts are claimed by goblin gangs. The prominent presence of Boros soldiers along the length of Tin Street helps the populace feel safer, but the threat of rubblebelt raiders and goblin thieves remains.

The **Transguild Promenade** makes its way across the district from the edge of the rubblebelt in Precinct Four to the southern gates of Precinct One. The Promenade's northern reach is heavily patrolled by Boros soldiers, and caravans coming from the north employ heavily armed escorts to ensure their safe passage through the ruined areas. Markets and parks line the avenue as it winds through Precinct One, and parades clog the street on festive holidays.

## Beneath the Streets
Even though most Ravnicans think the city begins at ground level and stretches upward, the part of the city that lies beneath the streets impacts the lives of everyone. Immediately underground are the city works, such as the sewers and the transit system. Below the complex network of tunnels and passages that make up the city works lies the undercity—a realm populated by creatures that shun the surface world.

### City Works
The Izzet League is responsible for constructing and maintaining public works, including sewers and other pipe systems. Many members of the Golgari Swarm live or work here, farming fungus and scavenging for valuable trinkets in the muck. Orzhov crypts and vaults, Dimir hideouts, and Simic laboratories can also be found in the city works.

> ##### Millennial Platform
>Anchored by enormous chains at the juncture of Precincts One, Three, and Four, the Millennial Platform is a floating observation deck that affords the best overhead view of the Tenth District. The most exclusive restaurant in the district is located here. Every citizen is given a token that can be redeemed for one airship ride to the platform anytime during the coming year, but those who want to dine at the Millennial Restaurant might have to make a reservation months in advance.
>

#### Sewers
A vast, winding sewer network runs under the Tenth District, lit by *continual flame* spells. Some of the tunnels are simply storm sewers, meant to carry rainwater (and the debris it washes from the streets) into great cisterns, where it is purified and sent into the pipes in the plumbing system that serves Ravnica's nicer neighborhoods. Others carry waste and refuse out of those neighborhoods, depositing it in different cisterns or dumping it into the subterranean oceans of the undercity.

#### Pipe Tunnels
Around the sewer system, smaller tunnel networks carry steam, distilled magical energy, and water to various places throughout the city. These passages are large enough for a humanoid to walk through but are often quite uncomfortable, filled with impure air and stifling heat.

#### Transit Tunnels
Magically charged tracks line the floors of tube-like tunnels that send vehicular constructs to major locations in the Tenth District and beyond. The tunnels open into small stations that have staircases leading up to the surface.

#### Crypts
Ancient resting places lie in secret chambers below the surface of Ravnica. Many of them have been magically warded to prevent unauthorized entry. Some of these sites are homes for restless undead or gathering places for thieves, smugglers, and other criminals.

### Undercity
![[063-303.png|right|300]]

Deep below the Tenth District lies a vast, thriving community of folk who have no desire or choice to live under the sky. Here, the Dimir, Golgari, **Rakdos**, and Simic hold sway in the caverns, causeways, and bodies of water that grace the darkest depths.

#### Nightveil
The sprawling residence of many of the House Dimir elite, parts of Nightveil overlap the Tenth District in the undercity. An extensive system of natural caverns houses high-walled mansions and sunken crypts that have a grand, sinister motif. Patrolling specters and other incorporeal undead make it difficult for the unwelcome to enter.

#### Duskmantle
The Dimir guildhall is protected by memory wards (glyphs of warding that store *modify memory* spells) to ensure that few know of its existence. Those who are called there never remember what transpired, beyond what is necessary. Most assume that the place lies somewhere within Nightveil, but it could lie anywhere in the undercity.

#### Korozda
Also called the Maze of Decay, Korozda is an arched subterranean cathedral surrounded by fungal hedgerows and moss-encrusted ruins. In its center is a great amphitheater where the most important issues are brought to the Golgari's attention. Penvar, the Hanging Keep, is a castle fixed upside down on the ceiling above the entrance to Korozda. Its soldiers, predominantly the insectoid kraul, prevent any unauthorized visitors to the Golgari stronghold.

#### Rix Maadi
Known as the Dungeon Palace, this is the guildhall of the Cult of **Rakdos**, and the lava-filled lair of the demon himself. An immense, crumbling, red stone staircase called the Demon's Vestibule begins the journey from the Smelting District down into the depths, treating travelers to terrifying images depicted on banners as they descend. Farther down, the temperature rises and the passage eventually opens up into the Festival Grounds, where the bloodiest performances of the **Rakdos** and their torturous equipment are on display.

#### The Undersea
Rivers, lakes, and oceans run deep below the surface of Ravnica. Several of them connect to the Simic habitats known as zonots. They are also used as thoroughfares by aquatic races and monsters.

## Precinct One
The grandeur of Precinct One is the heart of Ravnica's civilization, and visitors gawk at the impressive architecture and rub shoulders with the rich and powerful. Immaculately maintained avenues and manicured gardens create an impression of order, civility, and high culture. During the day, the streets are filled with tourists, government officials, diplomats, and wealthy merchants and financiers. At night, most of Precinct One is quiet, with a few lit carriages drawn by constructs and well-groomed beasts making their way to exclusive nightclubs and restaurants.

The people who live in this precinct are accustomed to having high-quality goods and spending a lot of leisure time in social engagements. Neighbors are polite and affable toward others of their station, but gossip is quite common and accepted.

![[064-304.png|right|300]]

### Affiliated Guilds
All the guilds have interests here. Lawyers, bureaucrats, and soldiers of the Azorius Senate are found throughout the precinct. The Orzhov Syndicate runs many of the clubs and restaurants here, and this is the location of both its guildhall, Orzhova, and its monumental Vizkopa Bank. The Selesnya Conclave helps to maintain the grounds around the plaza and is often involved as diplomatic envoys for meetings and negotiations that take place here.

### Neighborhoods and Landmarks
Precinct One has few permanent residents, except for the very wealthy and some government officials who live in well-appointed apartments. Buildings here are of modern construction and well maintained.

#### Tenth District Plaza
A popular place for meetings, recreation, shopping, and simply being seen, Tenth District Plaza is a beautiful oasis of calm and cleanliness. Kept perpetually clean through magic and constantly patrolled by Azorius arresters, the plaza is considered neutral ground for every guild, gang, and faction in the city. Drawing a weapon within the confines of the plaza is met with a swift response from the arresters and marks the offender as a person who can't be trusted.

#### Chamber of the Guildpact
The long promenade of Plaza Avenue connects the south end of Tenth District Plaza to the great meeting hall of the guilds. The Chamber of the Guildpact is accessible by a grand staircase leading up into a cavernous hall where visitors and dignitaries from all over Ravnica meet. The Living Guildpact has an office here, but he is seldom present. In his absence, various functionaries who occupy the upper levels of the chamber try to carry out his work of adjudicating disputes between guilds and maintaining a semblance of peace.

#### Plaza East
This neighborhood is home to many government officials, and it offers temporary housing for diplomats. Stately homes intermingle with more modest apartments. Transportation by carriage between Plaza East and Tenth District Plaza is readily available, especially in the morning and evening.

#### Plaza West
The best nightclubs and restaurants, most of which are run by the Orzhov, are in this neighborhood. There are few permanent residents in Plaza West, aside from the very rich who reside in spacious, luxurious, multilevel homes.

#### Plaza South
Derogatorily known as Downside by the nobles and elite, this neighborhood is the hub of commerce in Precinct One and has more permanent residents than the other neighborhoods. Specialty shops catering to tourists and the wealthy line the route of the Transguild Promenade as it runs through the area. The residents here tend to be well-to-do merchants and crafters, making their living off visitors and a few rich clients.

#### Orzhova
The Orzhov Syndicate's lavish guildhall, also known as the Church of Deals, is on the western edge of Tenth District Plaza. The towering spires and stained glass windows house the grand gatherings of the guild and also serve as the quarters for its most elite members, including the ghosts of the Obzedat. Below the cathedral lies the mausoleum, glittering with opulence and serving as a resting place and a gathering point for secret meetings far from prying eyes and the Guildpact.

#### Vizkopa Bank
The Orzhov-controlled main bank of Ravnica, and also the place where the Orzhov mint their coins, Vizkopa Bank is a giant, opulent structure guarded by gargoyles. Spirits in debt to the Orzhov float within its halls and around the outside of the building.

### Goods and Services
There are few general shops in Precinct One, but luxury items, grooming supplies, and fine clothing are available in boutiques in the area. Even practical items, such as backpacks and lanterns, are expensive and of the highest quality, bearing artisan's flourishes. Standard adventuring gear, including weapons and armor, is difficult to procure.

Meals and lodging suitable for a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle are readily available in Plaza West, and comfortable accommodations are the norm for the officials in Plaza East and the merchants in Plaza South. Poorer people, including anyone who maintains a lifestyle as expensive as modest, might be seen as uncouth or undesirable.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who don't maintain a comfortable or more expensive lifestyle might have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct One.

### Law and Crime
The privileged and wealthy people who live in Precinct One believe that the purpose of law enforcement is to serve them and keep them protected from the more unsavory elements of the city. Government officials here are more practical in their view of the law, recognizing that Precinct One is the entry point into the Tenth for many visitors and thus it must keep up the best of appearances. Azorius law enforcement officers are ever-present here, with at least one arrester assigned to patrol each street in Precinct One. It is illegal to brandish a weapon here, and people who walk around with unconcealed weapons (even sheathed ones) draw attention. Minor crimes are reported as soon as they are witnessed or discovered. Due to enhanced monitoring by precognitive mages, the typical response time to any crime is 1d6 minutes, and the squad consists of an Azorius **lawmage** and three **soldiers**.

Very little street-level illicit activity takes place within Precinct One due to Azorius's constant surveillance. Private rooms in exclusive establishments are, however, sometimes used by the Orzhov and other wealthy criminals to conduct high-end black market transactions away from the eyes of law enforcement.

## Precinct Two
Small houses, modest apartments, and commercial shops are sprinkled throughout Precinct Two, a place that law enforcement officers, lawyers, retired soldiers, and well-off working families call home. Corner shops cater to everyday needs, and many establishments are run by ex-soldiers. Streets are kept tidy, and buildings are maintained to be serviceable. Under the precinct's urbane veneer, tension simmers between law officers and the opportunistic crime families who call this precinct home.

The folk who live in this precinct believe in performing civic duties, conforming to your role, and maintaining strong friendships and family ties. Good neighbors show respect to one another and enjoy competing among themselves to achieve greater successes.

![[067-307.png|right|300]]

### Affiliated Guilds
New Prahv, the Azorius Senate guildhall, is located at the eastern end of the precinct, and many residents work there. Some active officers and retired soldiers from the Boros Legion make their homes in this precinct. The Orzhov Syndicate has a presence here through its connections to many of the small businesses.

### Neighborhoods and Landmarks
Most of Precinct Two is occupied by small commercial centers and rows of simple houses. It is populous but not stiflingly so.

#### New Prahv
The tallest structure in the Tenth District, the austere New Prahv consists of three towering columns, reminding everyone of the omnipresence of the Azorius Senate. Each column serves as the headquarters for one of the three branches of the senate. Inside, spacious chambers on the lower floors give way to a host of offices upstairs where day-to-day assignments are issued and the strategy of maintaining law is continually honed.

#### Whitestone
Whitestone is an orderly neighborhood on the northern side of the precinct, named for its rows of alabaster stone houses. It was built up by the Azorius to serve as a housing zone for many who work in New Prahv. To meet the demands of construction, many residents of this section of the city had to be relocated to the much more densely populated Griffin Heights.

#### Griffin Heights
![[068-308.png|right|300]]

Two-story houses are nestled in the rolling hills of this neighborhood in the southern section of the precinct. Griffin Heights is rife with corruption, and less scrupulous government officials exchange information and money with the Orzhov in business establishments here. The locals are fiercely loyal to the Orzhov knights who watch over them, dutifully paying their protection fees.

#### Augustin Station
The main airship station for the Tenth District, Augustin Station is located at the western end of Griffin Heights. Travelers from all over Ravnica are carried in various forms of air travel: from gondolas hung from giant balloons to compartments strapped to the backs of enormous floating beasts bred by the Simic Combine. Augustin Station has twenty platforms, with flights arriving and leaving at all hours. The most popular flight is to the Millennial Platform, a journey that costs 5 sp per passenger. Other flights carry passengers to smaller stations in each precinct of the Tenth District (1 gp), to large stations in each other district (10 gp), and to various other stations around the world (1 gp per mile).

#### Statue of Agrus Kos
A ten-foot-tall granite statue of a Boros Legion soldier stands in a small park in Whitestone, surrounded by weatherworn tables. During the Decamillennial Celebration seventy-six years ago, Agrus Kos became a hero by foiling various schemes to undermine the Guildpact. His statue has become a social gathering point for war veterans, mob contacts, and spies who talk as they play various strategy games.

### Goods and Services
Most any sort of merchandise can be acquired from some shop in Precinct Two. Former soldiers and ex-adventurers run many of the businesses here, and weapons and armor are commonly available in Griffin Heights. Meals and lodging are often of modest or comfortable quality in this precinct, which has lots of boarding houses instead of inns. Corner taverns are frequent and serve as the centers of neighborhood society.

The people who live in Precinct Two aren't fond of people who don't fit in with them, and that includes those of both higher and lower means. People who don't maintain at least a modest lifestyle are viewed as lazy and undesirable, and those who aspire to a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle are seen as arrogant snobs. At the DM's discretion, adventurers in either category could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Two.

### Law and Crime
Many citizens in Precinct Two work for the Azorius, but others feel stifled by the guild's intrusive presence under the shadow of New Prahv. Most residents respect order, but some rely more on Orzhov protection than on Azorius law. Almost everyone here knows someone who is trained in the use of weapons. The typical response to a reported crime is about 2d6 minutes, and the squad consists of two Azorius **soldiers** or 1d6 Orzhov **thugs** (from the *Monster Manual*).

The organized crime elements of the neighborhoods are locked in a power struggle against law enforcement officials. This conflict rarely manifests in open violence, but often antagonists "disappear" or "have an accident." Overt violent crimes sometimes involve ex-soldiers who have been psychologically scarred by past battles.

## Precinct Three
![[069-309.png|right|300]]

Ample parks, busy stables, and large gardens combine to create a vibrant environment in Precinct Three. Natural and urban life intermingle throughout the precinct, and the people who reside here view it as a respite from most other places in the Tenth District. Folk here tend to live simply, and generations of families have dwelt in the same structures for hundreds of years. During the day, the gardens, small pastures, and stables are tended by young and old. Evenings are given over to communal gatherings, sometimes featuring performances by trained beasts or storytelling.

The people of Precinct Three are comfortable with living around nature. They have no problems with pets or beastly companions sharing their space as well as residing in multifamily structures. Good neighbors help tend to plants, animals, and children whenever necessary.

![[070-310.png|right|300]]

### Affiliated Guilds
The Selesnya Conclave's influence on this area is strong, and its guildhall, the towering tree of Vitu-Ghazi, stands at the northern edge of the precinct. Members of the Gruul Clans sometimes venture into the northern part of the precinct, rarely with peaceful intentions.

### Neighborhoods and Landmarks
Precinct Three is made up of old stone structures partially reclaimed by nature, standing alongside well-preserved wooden buildings that have been enhanced by Selesnya magic.

#### Vitu-Ghazi
The Selesnya guildhall, a towering tree that also serves as a cathedral to Mat'Selesnya, is the epicenter of Selesnya culture and law. Members of the conclave from across Ravnica make pilgrimages to Vitu-Ghazi in hopes of finding a spiritual connection with the heart of the guild. All who come without ill intent in their heart are welcome to visit the public areas of the tree.

#### The Canopy
The northern neighborhood of the precinct is covered in tall trees, all of which are overshadowed by Vitu-Ghazi. To accommodate a growing population, buildings are situated around the trees and on the larger branches, making use of a network of ladders and rope walkways.

#### The Great Concourse
A network of elevated roadways links many of the most important Selesnya communities near Vitu-Ghazi. The polished white stone of the roadways gleams in the sun, and the pathways are topped with lush trees, grasses, and flowers. On high holy days, its central hub, called the Great Concourse, serves as a gathering place for throngs of Selesnya devotees. On most other days, the Concourse is a teeming marketplace where goods transported across the city on the great roadways are bought and sold.

#### Concordance
Once known as the Old City, the eastern neighborhood of Concordance is the oldest section of the precinct. Many buildings in this area were once Orzhov structures, but they have been reclaimed by moss, shrubs, and other growth that make them blend in with the homes, parks, and the Selesnya vernadi that fill the rest of the neighborhood. The Great Concourse runs overhead through most of the neighborhood.

#### Beast Haven
The western neighborhood has many small pastures and stables, some of which are on open, multilevel structures. The area is filled with the sights, sounds, and smells of beasts of many sorts. Here, beasts are trained for labor and sold to customers from across the city. Every so often, a beast escapes captivity and rampages through the neighborhood, but the tough residents are usually able to bring any disruption under control quickly.

### Goods and Services
![[071-311.png|right|300]]

The bounty of nature is plentiful in Precinct Three, which serves as the main source of food for the Tenth District. The finest steeds and livestock are raised here, as well as many war beasts (although they're often trained in Precinct Four). Unlike in most other precincts, barter is an acceptable form of transaction here, and some vendors outright reject payment in coin of any kind. Manufactured goods are relatively hard to find, except in large markets such as the Great Concourse.

Meals and lodging are widely varied, from squalid to comfortable, depending on the neighborhood. In general, the neighborhoods in Concordance tend toward the more expensive end of that scale, and those in Beast Haven more toward the other end. The residents of Precinct Three don't put much stock in personal appearance, and they're slow to pass judgment on anyone based on visible standards of wealth. The truly wretched sometimes evoke pity and sometimes scorn, and the very wealthy are generally disliked.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Three.

### Law and Crime
Most of Precinct Three is policed by its residents, occasionally supplemented by Boros troops when a serious threat rears its head. Each block elects a watch captain, who receives weapon training from Selesnya soldiers. The captain can call on additional citizens for support in case of a crisis. The typical response to a reported crime takes about 1d8 minutes, and the squad consists of a watch captain (a **scout**) with two **guards** or two **wolves**. In Concordance, it's either a **knight** or a Selesnya **druid** with a topiary guardian (**awakened tree**). See the *Monster Manual* for these creatures' stat blocks.

Crime usually takes one of two forms in Precinct Three. Some residents engage in outright banditry, but they typically target visitors or go outside the precinct to do their dirty work. More common are incidents of livestock theft, which sometimes lead to outbreaks of violence between neighbors, particularly in Beast Haven.

| 6 | "We should go find that loxodon priest and see if she's still having visions. I'll bet we can get her to tell us our future!" |

## Precinct Four
![[072-312.png|right|300]]

Few days or nights pass quietly in Precinct Four. The frequent din of battle as Boros soldiers guard against Gruul marauders, the strange sounds of volatile magic emanating from Izzet experiments, and the occasional explosive flare-ups of goblin gang wars keep the precinct a dynamic and dangerous place. Its buildings include ramshackle tenements damaged by conflict, impregnable fortresses and laboratories, and bustling markets filled with merchants ready to defend themselves and their wares.

The people of Precinct Four are always ready for a fight. Being able to defend oneself and adapting to change are the most important qualities in this precinct. Good neighbors are your battle mates when you're fighting for your home or your life.

![[073-313.png|right|300]]

### Affiliated Guilds
The Boros Legion's guildhall fortress, Sunhome, is located here, and that guild is the heart of the precinct's defense against the savage forces that come from the northern rubblebelt. The Izzet League often likes to test its latest experiments in this precinct. Its guildhall, Nivix, towers over the south end. The Gruul Clans frequently raid into the rest of the precinct from the rubblebelt in the north. The Cult of **Rakdos** delights in sowing mayhem here, stoking the fires of conflict and gathering inspiration for future performances.

### Neighborhoods and Landmarks
Precinct Four is home to a wide range of folk, most of whom are used to fighting for a living. Transients, soldiers, goblin gang members, and hardy merchants call this precinct home.

#### Sunhome
The seat of the Boros Legion's power, the guildhall known as Sunhome is an imposing structure that serves as a fortress, barracks, and spiritual center. It is widely believed to be impregnable and serves as a reminder to attackers from the north of the strength of Boros resolve.

#### Nivix
One of the tallest towers in Ravnica, this impressive structure crackles with the wild power of the Izzet and serves as their guildhall. Filled with laboratories, testing facilities, and housing for their inventors, Nivix is the center of Izzet innovation.

#### Red Wastes
The rubblebelt to the north is a wasteland filled with ruins, gutted buildings, and debris-ridden streets. Aside from the Gruul Clans, the only citizens who live in the neighborhood are the ones too stubborn to move away. The Gruul share the space with ferocious beasts, elementals, and other monsters.

#### The Bulwark
The neighborhood between Sunhome and Nivix is filled with reinforced structures that serve as low-rent apartments and shops. Those who live in the Bulwark are mainly workers or professionals who see opportunity in supporting the Boros garrison.

#### Skarrg
The Gruul Clans periodically converge on the gutted, cratered remains of a huge palace in the Red Wastes where a great bonfire perpetually burns. Skarrg is the closest thing the Gruul have to a guildhall—a place where their clans can come together, roast giant boars, boast of their exploits, and form something akin to camaraderie before they go their separate, violent ways. It's not neutral ground, though—old grudges frequently boil over into combat. Outsiders are never welcome.

### Goods and Services
Precinct Four has a wide variation in available goods, depending on the neighborhood. There is little or no commerce in the Red Wastes, except for what can be bartered with Gruul clansfolk or scavenged. The Bulwark carries many basic goods and services, with weapons and armor plentiful due to the constant threat of conflict and the nearby foundries in District Six. On Tin Street, almost anything is available for a bit of searching and the right price.

The precinct offers a wide range of food and lodging, appropriate for lifestyles from squalid to wealthy. The more affluent folk of the precinct are careful not to flaunt their wealth, lest they make themselves targets for raiders from the Red Wastes.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who maintain either a squalid or aristocratic lifestyle could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Four.

### Law and Crime
![[074-314.png|right|300]]

Much of Precinct Four is a war zone, and mundane methods of law enforcement aren't always effective in such an environment. No one takes the constant patrolling of the Boros Legion as a guarantee of their safety, and almost all folk know how to fight to some degree. Typical threats include giant monsters, unstable elementals, and Gruul raiding parties, and a curfew system is often instituted when a neighborhood is beset by one of these dangers. The only area that is usually safe from external threats is Tin Street. Petty crimes aren't given much attention, since the soldiers are primarily concerned with curbing violence and mayhem. The typical response to a reported crime or a dangerous threat is 1d8 minutes, and the squad consists of a Boros Legion **knight** (from the *Monster Manual*)**** leading 4d4 **soldiers**.

The Red Wastes is a lawless region mostly beyond the reach of Boros patrols and Azorius laws. In other parts of the precinct, goblin gangs shake down locals whenever possible and skirmish against each other over turf. The Shattergang Brothers are a notorious goblin gang that haunts Tin Street in this precinct, dealing in weapons and explosives.

## Precinct Five
![[075-315.png|right|300]]

As the home of prestigious universities, ancient libraries, and hidden laboratories, Precinct Five is the hub of information and learning in the Tenth District. People of all ages flock to this precinct to spend time learning, whether by poring over texts and scrolls or finding a mentor who will guide a student. It's also the place to find information brokers, who sell specialized or secret knowledge available nowhere else. Multilevel buildings set next to each other with little regard for planning give way to an occasional square or open campus where socially minded residents congregate during daytime hours. At night, many continue their studies while others tinker with their latest creations or intellectual endeavors. Taverns and pubs tend to be more urbane than in other parts of the district and often feature poetry readings, storytelling, and musical performances.

People who live in Precinct Five have a zeal for learning and tend to be inquisitive. Getting into a heated debate or touting a recent success to your neighbors is part of showing your worth. Good neighbors keep their projects and research hidden until a result can be displayed; it is considered uncouth to allow others to view a work in progress.

![[076-316.png|right|300]]

### Affiliated Guilds
Zonot Seven, the home of the Simic Combine's guildhall, is located on the western edge of the precinct. The Izzet League maintains a network of laboratories and workshops close to Nivix (in Precinct Four). House Dimir agents are seen and unseen all around the district, and they secretly run the Ismeri Library. Some members of the Azorius Senate who prefer to study disciplines aside from the law make their homes here as well.

### Neighborhoods and Landmarks
Life for residents in Precinct Five is spent mostly indoors, or in the case of the Simic, underwater. The precinct's occupants—including significant populations of students, instructors, researchers, scribes, and university staff—are crowded into dormitories and apartments squeezed in among laboratories, libraries, and magical machinery.

#### Zonot Seven
The Simic Combine's watery habitat is made up of huge sinkholes filled with the overflow from a subterranean ocean. Zonot Seven is the only zonot within Ravnica City proper, and it contains Zameck, the Simic guildhall. In contrast to the rest of the precinct, the zonot is a bustling place, with activity at all hours. A huge chamber just below the street surface serves as a gathering place for all the Simic speakers, as well as a place where visitors can meet with Prime Speaker **Zegana** or other Simic emissaries. A Simic researcher might invite a land-dwelling colleague to visit the habitat, but such an occurrence isn't common. Canals lead from here farther into the precinct and to Precinct Six.

#### The Blistercoils
A series of gigantic waterwheels, built and operated by the Izzet League, turns just outside Zonot Seven in the north end of the precinct. The system generates magical energy to power public works, Simic laboratories, and, of course, Izzet workshops. Few outside the Izzet realize that the amount of energy generated in the Blistercoils far exceeds what is actually used, with the excess stored in underground batteries that could explode if they became overloaded.

Blistercoils is also the name of the neighborhood near the waterwheels, which largely consists of workshops and private laboratories.

#### Hightower
The western end of the precinct is packed with educational institutions of all sorts, from grand universities that cover a broad span of disciplines to specialized schools that instruct students in subjects ranging from theoretical metaphysics to fine arts. The neighborhood takes its name from the fact that most of these schools boast at least one tall spire among their structures. Students and staff live both on and off the various campuses, and several cozy pubs and small lecture halls are busy from afternoons through late in the night.

#### Prism University
A crystal-paned center of learning that concentrates on magical theory and application, Prism University draws potential wizards and other would-be mages who want to learn about all forms of magic, in contrast to the specialized and practical applications of magic espoused by the guilds. Even though the school maintains a formal state of neutrality, it's an open secret that many guilds have infiltrated the university and planted agents to woo prospective members. Partly as a result of this influence, many graduates of the university do go on to join a guild, finding a way to apply their broad experience to support the narrower focus of the guild. (A player character spellcaster might well be a graduate of the university, which could explain the character's ability to use magic that wouldn't normally be taught within their guild.)

#### Ismeri Library
One of the greatest libraries on all Ravnica, the Ismeri Library is open to all citizens at all hours. Hundreds of thousands of books covering every conceivable subject are found here. The place is also one of the centers of Dimir communication. Secret messages are hidden within its books by a variety of methods both magical and mundane. Dimir agents might have to gather message fragments hidden within several different documents, for example, to find their next assignments or targets. Intricate codes and magical wards protect other secrets.

### Goods and Services
Specialty items that are commonly used by scribes, researchers, and inventors can be found in many small shops in the precinct, usually run by a tinker or academic. Precinct Five also has the best apothecaries, alchemists, and magic-mongers in the Tenth District. On the other hand, mundane adventuring gear, weapons, and armor are harder to find.

Information is an especially valuable commodity in Precinct Five. In addition to holding booksellers, the precinct is home to a variety of people who make a living (or at least a sizable side income) selling information, including private investigators, rumormongers, and spies.

Meals and lodging of modest to wealthy quality are available here. Older and more experienced people—high-ranking Simic researchers or established scholars—tend to maintain lifestyles toward the more expensive end of that scale.

The poor are pitied and the most affluent are envied, so adventurers who maintain an aristocratic, poor, squalid, or wretched lifestyle, at the DM's discretion, could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Five.

![[077-317.png|right|300]]

### Law and Crime
Much of the crime in Precinct Five is of a sort that is hard to detect: blackmail, espionage, identity theft (of the literal kind, perpetrated by shapechangers), and the like. Most of the precinct's residents spend their time absorbed in study, unaware that such activities might be happening under their noses. Only rarely does violence break out, and Azorius arresters try hard to keep the incident quiet and maintain public calm.

The typical response to a reported crime here is 1d12 minutes, and the force consists of two Azorius arresters (use the **veteran** stat block in the *Monster Manual*).

## Precinct Six
![[079-319.png|right|300]]

Large warehouses, major thoroughfares, and nondescript worker tenements make the utilitarian Precinct Six a hub of activity for shipping, storage, and other mercantile concerns in the Tenth District. Wide cobblestone streets allow for the passage of beasts and constructs that transport raw goods from points beyond the Tenth and for the shipping of manufactured materials back to those locations. The demands of commerce keep the area constantly active, and the inconspicuous nature of the warehouses makes them popular as rendezvous points for all sorts of transactions, legal and illicit. At night, lurking undead and the horrors of the undercity, coming up from Deadbridge Chasm, keep wary citizens indoors, while a few people who deal in sinister magic seek the monsters out for nefarious purposes.

People who live in this working-class precinct are often practical-minded and thus tolerant of some degree of illicit activity. Being a good neighbor means keeping to yourself, unless you live in the Smelting Quarter, where the atmosphere is much more raucous.

![[080-320.png|right|300]]

### Affiliated Guilds
The Orzhov Syndicate owns many of the warehouses in the precinct and controls much of the commerce around Tin Street. Members of the Golgari Swarm often crawl around the edges of Deadbridge Chasm, which is an opening to their sprawling subterranean network. The Boros Legion rents many of the warehouses to store manufactured goods from the Smelting Quarter, and Kamen Fortress houses a garrison to protect Boros interests. The Cult of **Rakdos** operates a number of pain clubs throughout the precinct, especially around Tin Street, and **Rakdos** street performances are more common in Precinct Six than anywhere else in the Tenth District.

### Neighborhoods and Landmarks
Precinct Six is home to many working-class folk, most packed into modest apartments near their place of work. It's also home to more than its share of monsters, most of which are active at night.

#### Smelting Quarter
The heart of the manufacturing industry in the Tenth District is at the north end of the precinct. The Smelting Quarter is smoky, hot, and filled with activity day and night. Goblins often make their homes near the factories on Foundry Street, preferring the constant activity to sleepier neighborhoods. Standing south and east of the quarter, Kamen Fortress is a Boros garrison dedicated to keeping watch on **Rakdos** activity. Clashes between the Boros Legion, the goblins, and the Cult of **Rakdos** are common throughout this part of the precinct.

#### Gore House
A **Rakdos** club called the Gore House, run by a viashino (lizardfolk) named Nyoser, occupies a defunct factory in the south end of the Smelting Quarter—and also houses the main entrance to the Demon's Vestibule, the stairway down to Rix Maadi.

#### Medori Park
The western part of the precinct, Medori Park, is named after an Orzhov pontiff who converted a city park into a warehouse lot many years ago. This neighborhood is particularly rife with undead at night, both corporeal and incorporeal. Some serve dark masters and often guard valuables, while others pursue their own evil urges. The Orzhov Syndicate owns many large warehouses here, and the Boros Legion maintains facilities to store a variety of equipment used by their soldiers, including valuable weapons and armor. The most important facilities are heavily guarded—often by angels, whether Boros or Orzhov.

#### Deadbridge Chasm
A gaping opening in the ground dominates the precinct and is lined with mossy stairs and fungal blooms. Deadbridge Chasm serves as an entrance to the Golgari's undercity realm and their guildhall, Korozda. The area smells of decomposition, an odor that grows particularly intense on hot days. Many kraul make their homes in the walls that line the cavernous descent, and Devkarin elves come up to the surface through this passage to trade on Tin Street.

#### Wayport
The neighborhood of Wayport rises like a pillar from the midst of Deadbridge Chasm, and a number of bridges, large and small, connect it to the surrounding city of multiple vertical levels. Many goods traded with other districts are funneled along Tin Street, often pausing in Wayport's warehouses along the way. But only the wealthiest merchants can afford storage space here.

#### Benzer's Bridge
This wide bridge is a main thoroughfare for cargo traveling to and from districts beyond the Tenth. A small market is located here, complete with shops and restaurants, all of which close after dark. Secret pain clubs, hidden below the market in dark rooms inside the bridge itself, come alive after sunset.

### Goods and Services
Trade goods can easily be acquired in Precinct Six, along with manufactured items such as artisan's tools. Weapons, armor, and mounts are rarely on sale here. Fences deal in stolen and otherwise illicit goods. On Tin Street, which runs along the eastern side of the precinct, most anything can be had for the right price.

Meals and lodging of poor to modest quality meet the needs of the laborers, dock hands, and street performers of Precinct Six for a price they can afford. The wealthy are viewed as outsiders, and the truly impoverished are generally shunned.

At the DM's discretion, adventurers who maintain a lifestyle less expensive than poor or more expensive than modest could have disadvantage on Charisma checks when interacting with residents of Precinct Six.

### Law and Crime
The folk of Precinct Six are pragmatic, not overly concerned with the welfare of others, and thus often willing to disregard minor crimes. Arresters from the Azorius Senate can often be found on patrol in and around the warehouses. Soldiers from the Boros Legion are common near the warehouses and in the Smelting Quarter. The typical response time to a reported crime in these areas is 2d10 minutes, and the squad consists of two Boros **soldiers**. At night or in the Smelting Quarter, a response to an attack might instead consist of 1d4 Boros **soldiers** led by a sergeant (use the **knight** stat block in the *Monster Manual*).

Precinct Six is a hotbed for illicit activity, particularly organized crime. Goblin gangs haunt the Smelting Quarter, most notably a large gang that claims Foundry Street, led by a goblin named Krenko. Vicious turf wars sometimes erupt in that area. Violent crimes occur with regularity all over the precinct, with most of the bodies ending up in Deadbridge Chasm. Night-lurking monsters are a particular problem in the precinct as well, often attacking and disappearing before help can arrive.

# Chapter 4: Creating Adventures
![[081-401.jpg|right|300]]

This chapter provides a toolbox to help the Dungeon Master create adventures featuring the guilds of Ravnica. The tensions among the guilds, a constant current of animosity, provide a solid foundation for building adventures.

"*Krenko's Way*" can be used to launch a Ravnica campaign.

The tables and advice in this chapter expand on the material in *chapter 3* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Monsters and nonplayer characters mentioned on the tables can be found either in the *Monster Manual* or in *chapter 6* of this book. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the *Monster Manual*. If the stat block appears elsewhere, the text tells you so.

## Guild-Based Adventures
Each guild gets a section in this chapter to help you craft adventures inspired by that guild. In a guild's section, four basic seeds for creating adventures are provided: guild locations, guild villains, character objectives, and adventure hooks.

### Guild Locations
Each guild's entry in this chapter includes a map of an iconic location associated with the guild. Any of these sites can serve as the location for an adventure.

The description of each guild location includes a table that lists possible goals for an adventure based there. You can choose an adventure goal, or roll one randomly, from the table in the description of the site you've chosen. If none of those goals inspires you, choose a goal or roll one randomly from the Guild Location Goals table instead.

##### Guild Location Goals
| d8 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Prevent a magical catastrophe inside the location. |
| 2 | Find the source of strange occurrences in or near the location. |
| 3 | Escape the location (and help others escape) when a disaster occurs inside. |
| 4 | Quell a riot inside or around the location. |
| 5 | Kill or drive out a monster that has turned the location into its lair. |
| 6 | Defend the location against an external attacker. |
| 7 | Seize control of the location. |
| 8 | Infiltrate the location and report on what's happening inside. |

#### Linked Locations
You can create an adventure that links two locations together. The Location Connections table offers broad suggestions for how you might lead your players from one adventure location to another.

##### Location Connections
| d6 | Adventure Connection |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Transport a person, an object, or information collected at the first location safely to the second. |
| 2 | Plant something taken from the first location inside the second to incriminate someone in the second location. |
| 3 | Do the same thing at the second location as was done at the first. |
| 4 | Uncover the source of interference encountered at the first location, which lies in the second. |
| 5 | Follow a fleeing foe or trail a suspicious figure from the first location to the second. |
| 6 | Follow up on information gained at the first location by investigating the second. |

### Guild Villains
Player characters might belong to any guild, and their adversaries might as well. The guild entries in this chapter offer examples of the kinds of villains and villainous schemes that might be connected to each guild.

Certain kinds of goals and schemes are common to villains in every guild. Some generic villainous schemes appear on the Guild Villains table. You can also use the Villain's Scheme and Villain's Methods tables in *chapter 4* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to flesh out a villain's activities, and a guild's section in this chapter points to specific parts of those tables that characterize how villains from that guild enact their plans.

##### Guild Villains
| d6 | Villainous Activity |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A villain is attempting to disgrace or discredit a powerful person. |
| 2 | A villain is striving for power within their guild. |
| 3 | A villain has claimed power in their guild and needs to be supplanted. |
| 4 | The villain is sending agents to infiltrate one or more guilds. |
| 5 | The villain's agents are luring members away from another guild. |
| 6 | The villain's agents are sabotaging the operations of another guild. |

### Character Objectives
The impetus for adventuring might come from within the player characters' own guilds, rather than from external guilds. Each guild entry in this chapter provides some examples of missions that the guild might send its members on. These missions can also serve as side quests that a character is asked to fulfill while engaged in a larger task that involves the whole party.

##### Guild Character Objectives
| d8 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Find an item that is important to the guild. |
| 2 | Get information from a guild member. |
| 3 | Protect or rescue a guild member in the midst of a catastrophe. |
| 4 | Free a guild member from captivity. |
| 5 | Find a missing guild member. |
| 6 | Kill or capture an enemy of the guild. |
| 7 | Help a guild member who's in trouble with the law. |
| 8 | Recruit someone to join the guild. |

### Adventure Hooks
Each guild section includes a table of adventure hooks—events that might drive adventures but don't necessarily involve specific locations or villains. They offer a general description of circumstances that can lead to adventure.

## Choosing a Guild
Here are the main ways to approach the choice of guild for your adventure:

- Choose a guild that has an aesthetic or a story that excites you and that will lead to the sort of villain or type of adventure you want to build. The following section, "Adventure Types," shows how different guilds are natural fits for certain types of adventure.
- Pick a guild that fits your players' tastes. The introduction to the *Dungeon Master's Guide* offers some guidance for crafting adventures to please different kinds of players. The guild or guilds your players choose will also help you understand your players' desires. It's a safe bet that a player who creates a **Rakdos** character is looking for mayhem and combat, while a Dimir player is more interested in intrigue and sabotage. Armed with that understanding, you can better craft an adventure experience aimed at your players.
- Go with a guild that easily provides a villain to face. A few guilds make very straightforward villains: Gruul, **Rakdos**, Dimir, and Golgari.
- Let a die decide the guild, using the Random Guilds table in this book's introduction.

The guild you choose will provide a potential location, villain, mission, or adventure hook, as well as point you toward the type of adventure you're going to run.

> ##### Quick Build
>To make a simple location-based adventure quickly, follow these steps: 
>
>1. Choose a guild (or use the Guilds table in *chapter 1* if you want to choose randomly). The adventure will take place in that guild's location, as described in this chapter. 
>
>2. Determine the adventure goal using the table associated with that location. 
>
>3. Use creatures associated with the guild (shown on the tables in *chapter 6*) to populate the location. Optionally, you can use the Location Connections table in this chapter to link the location you're using to a second location. You can either select a location based on the result of that table or determine the second location randomly.

### Adventure Types
![[082-402.png|right|300]]

Certain guilds lend themselves to particular types of adventures better than others, as shown below. If you're interested in running an intrigue adventure, where the heroes must unravel twisted plots within plots, you'll want to choose a different guild from what you would select if you want to run a dungeon delve that will take the adventurers into the labyrinthine undercity.

#### Dungeon Delve
Beneath the urban environment of Ravnica is an entirely different city—the dark, dank undercity, where vermin and horrors lurk and the Golgari Swarm maintains its elegant courts. Indeed, thousands of years of development have buried countless layers of construction beneath the current surface streets, making the undercity much larger than the surface city, though much of it is inaccessible. But if a sinkhole or other catastrophe opens long-sealed vaults and exposes them to the surface again, who knows what horrors might be revealed?

##### Dungeon Delve Guilds
| d12 | Guild |
|:---:|---|
| 1–3 | House Dimir |
| 4–8 | Golgari Swarm |
| 9–10 | Cult of **Rakdos** |
| 11–12 | Simic Combine |

#### Wilderness
Though the world is covered with streets and buildings, Ravnica also has its wilderness areas, including the ruined rubblebelts haunted by the Gruul and the sylvan wilds cultivated by the Selesnya.

##### Wilderness Guilds
| d6 | Guild |
|:---:|---|
| 1–4 | Gruul Clans |
| 5–6 | Selesnya Conclave |

#### Plots and Intrigue
Every guild has its internal politics, making it easy for characters to get caught up in intrigue—particularly within their own guilds. Certain guilds are more likely to involve themselves in the politics of *other* guilds, which makes them particularly good villains for intrigue-based adventures.

##### Intrigue Guilds
| d12 | Guild |
|:---:|---|
| 1–2 | Azorius Senate |
| 3–6 | House Dimir |
| 7–8 | Golgari Swarm |
| 9–11 | Orzhov Syndicate |
| 12 | Simic Combine |

#### Mystery
Ravnica is rife with crime, presenting law-abiding adventurers with ample opportunity to put their mystery-solving skills to the test. Identifying a guild assassin, tracking a stolen treasure, or unmasking a corrupt bureaucrat could all fall into this category. Of course, the adventurers need not be virtuous or law-abiding themselves: the Orzhov are more apt to send their own enforcers after thieves than they are to turn to the forces of law for assistance.

##### Mystery Guilds
| d12 | Guild |
|:---:|---|
| 1–4 | House Dimir |
| 5–7 | Golgari Swarm |
| 8 | Izzet League |
| 9–11 | Orzhov Syndicate |
| 12 | Simic Combine |

#### Disaster
When a cyclonic rift sweeps through the streets, an uncontrolled wurm crashes through buildings, or a laboratory experiment goes haywire, heroes might be called upon to shelter the innocent, stop the disaster at its source, or hunt down the villain responsible.

##### Disaster Guilds
| d12 | Guild |
|:---:|---|
| 1–2 | Golgari Swarm |
| 3–5 | Gruul Clans |
| 6–8 | Izzet League |
| 9–10 | Selesnya Conclave |
| 11–12 | Simic Combine |

#### Protection
When the innocent are victimized by the powerful, heroes step in. Criminal shakedowns, military raids, endless riots, and more are chances for characters to prove their mettle and earn the adulation of the populace.

##### Protection Guilds
| d12 | Guild |
|:---:|---|
| 1–2 | Boros Legion |
| 3–6 | Gruul Clans |
| 7–8 | Orzhov Syndicate |
| 9–12 | Cult of **Rakdos** |

### Guild versus Guild
Interguild conflict is such a fundamental aspect of life on Ravnica that the player characters' guild membership is an easy starting point for choosing an adventure villain. If you choose a villain from a guild that's already in conflict with one or more guilds that the characters belong to, it's easy to craft villainous goals that are at odds with the characters' goals.

If all the player characters belong to a single guild, choosing almost any other guild will provide opportunities for conflict. The natural state of the relationship between any two guilds is tension at best, and open warfare at worst. All it takes is a villain willing to upset the balance of power, and the characters' guild or their own motivations should easily bring them into conflict with the villain. A party's own guild could even provide a villain, given the amount of scheming and intrigue that exists even within the guilds. A guild official gone rogue, members of the same guild at odds with one another, or even a corrupt guildmaster can put characters in conflict with their own guild.

If the characters come from different guilds, a common enemy provides a good reason for them to work together. Any guild that isn't represented by one of the characters is a fine choice for a villain.

![[083-403.png|right|300]]

## Involving the Characters
Once you've chosen an adventure seed—a villain, a mission, or a general hook—you need to figure out what gets the player characters involved in the adventure. The answer could be as simple as a guildmaster or other authority sending them on a mission, but it's generally good to hook the characters in personally. What motivation do they have to thwart the villain?

The best answers to this question stem either from the adventurers' personalities, ideals, and histories, or from their guild affiliations. The characters might have a common reason to fight the villain (especially if they all belong to the same guild or have been adventuring together for a while), or they might all oppose the villain for different reasons.

For example, say your villain is a group of Gruul anarchs raiding in a densely populated area. A Boros character might be assigned to protect innocent bystanders, or might just happen to be in the area and leap to the defense of the innocents. An Izzet character might be trying to make sure that an Izzet laboratory in the area isn't damaged or its secrets looted. A Dimir spy might leap at the opportunity to steal some Izzet secrets when the laboratory comes under attack.

The Cross Purposes table can help you involve the characters in an adventure by suggesting ways that a villain's activities might directly conflict with the player characters' goals or interests.

##### Cross Purposes
| d10 | The Villain's Activities... |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | ... directly target one or more characters. The adventure begins when characters are attacked by the villain's agents. |
| 2 | ... threaten a character's contact or bond. |
| 3 | ... challenge a character's ideal or exploit a flaw. The character might hear rumors of this activity, spurring them into action. |
| 4 | ... open an opportunity for a character to pursue a personal goal. |
| 5 | ... compete with a character's guild. A guild authority might order the character to rectify the situation. |
| 6 | ... threaten guild members or property. |
| 7 | ... conflict with guild goals. |
| 8 | ... open an opportunity for a guild to pursue its own agenda. |
| 9 | ... catch the characters between fighting forces. |
| 10 | ... cause an accident or catastrophe that traps the characters. |

## Complications
An adventure that pits player characters against a single guild is relatively straightforward, but adding another guild can make an adventure even more interesting.

The involvement of a second guild can be as simple as the appearance of a bumbling innocent who needs the characters' protection, or as complex as a second villain who pursues an entirely separate scheme. The Secondary Guild Role table presents a range of options.

##### Secondary Guild Role
| d8 | Secondary Guild Role |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A rival pursues the same goal as the adventurers, but is doing it "wrong." |
| 2 | One or more members of another guild are caught between the villain and the adventurers. |
| 3 | A group of NPC adventurers from another guild confront the same villain for different reasons. |
| 4 | Someone is manipulating the villain for their own purposes. |
| 5 | A known rival or enemy meddles in the adventure, hoping the adventurers will fail. |
| 6 | A known rival or enemy can provide essential help in stopping the villain. |
| 7 | A second villain's plot is unfolding at the same time but is otherwise unrelated. |
| 8 | A second villain is in competition with the first one. |

### Guild Intrigue
Intrigue in Ravnica most often involves interaction between two guilds, so you can use the Guild Intrigue table to find the nugget of a plot. The villain tables in the guild entries can help you determine the nature and motivations of the individuals involved.

##### Guild Intrigue
| d6 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Guilds are vying for influence over a prominent individual (who might be a player character). |
| 2 | Guilds are competing for control of a key site or swath of territory. |
| 3 | Guilds are locked in a deadly feud but might be open to a peace negotiation. |
| 4 | Villains from two or more guilds are forming a dangerous alliance. |
| 5 | A villain is trying to disrupt an alliance between two or more guilds. |
| 6 | Splinter factions from two guilds are trying to form a new guild. |

### Allies and Rivals
![[084-404.png|right|300]]

A friendly contact can act as a patron, sending a character on a mission or a side quest either as a formal assignment or as a favor. Friendly contacts also have a knack for getting into perilous situations from which they need to be rescued, which can sometimes force characters into making difficult choices between saving friendly nonplayer characters and capturing villainous ones. In extraordinary circumstances, a friendly contact might even join the adventuring party for a short time.

Contacts who have a more antagonistic relationship with a character can hinder the adventuring party's efforts in a variety of ways. They might appear at inconvenient times to delay the party, or catch the group in the midst of some illegal activity. They might leak information to the adventure's villain, subtly aid the villain's efforts, or even become villains themselves.

Contacts can complicate things even more when they interact with multiple player characters or with each other. Consider what might happen when two people who are friendly contacts for two different characters are bitter enemies of each other, or when a single NPC is a good friend of one character and a rival of another. The characters might have to navigate those complex relationships in order to achieve their goals.

> ##### Random Nonplayer Characters
>Any time you need an NPC for an adventure—for example, if the player characters are sent on a mission to rescue a member of their guild—you can use the contacts tables in *chapter 2* to help flesh out the NPC. If you don't know the NPC's guild affiliation, you can roll on the Random Guilds table in this book's introduction to determine the guild. Then you can choose an appropriate stat block to represent the NPC's game statistics.
>

## Azorius Senate
![[085-405.png|right|300]]

Adventures involving the Azorius Senate naturally revolve around law enforcement. Player characters who find themselves on the wrong side of the law might be forced to confront well-meaning Azorius arresters as enemies, even if the characters are innocent of any wrongdoing. Lawful characters might also assist the Azorius in maintaining law and order on the mean streets of Ravnica.

### Arrester Station
Map 4.1 depicts an arrester station, which serves as the law enforcement hub for a precinct or neighborhood.

#### Arrester Station Adventures
Characters might be drawn to the arrester station because of prisoners held there, information or items stored there, or crimes occurring there. The Arrester Station Adventures table presents some possibilities.

##### Arrester Station Adventures
| d12 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Break out of the holding cells. |
| 2 | Break someone else out of the holding cells. |
| 3 | Stop someone before they can give information to the arresters or testify before a judge. |
| 4 | Protect a prisoner from assassins. |
| 5 | Get information from or to someone in the holding cells. |
| 6 | Apprehend a former prisoner who used magic to take over the station and drive the guards away. |
| 7 | Retrieve something held as evidence. |
| 8 | Find proof that the captain of this station is corrupt. |
| 9 | Discover who helped a prisoner escape and how. |
| 10 | Uncover a plot to discredit, blackmail, or kill the station commander. |
| 11 | Steal the arresters' files about a criminal or a case. |
| 12 | Intercept a message being sent to or from the station. |

#### Arrester Station Map
Two separate buildings make up this station, separated by an elevated plaza. One end of the station includes a courthouse (the lower level) and a prison (upper level).

Wide, impressive stairs lead to the main courthouse entrance, which opens into a large waiting room. All the doors leading out of the waiting room are kept locked, so they can be opened only from the other side. To either side of the waiting room are private meeting rooms, which lead back to an extensive area of offices for the large staff that keeps the place running.

The twin courtrooms include bench seats for spectators and witnesses. The judges preside from platforms that hover in midair, with shallow pools of water below. The accused are seated on balconies that overlook the same pools. Doors at the back of these balconies lead to a central hallway that ends at a staircase that ascends to the prison level.

Direct access to the prison area from outside the building is provided by two long, narrow staircases that lead up from the plaza. The stairs end at a balcony that is guarded at all times by archers behind arrow slits. A narrow hall leads through several locked doors to the cells—the general population on one side, where prisoners are allowed to mingle to some extent, and a high-security area on the other side, featuring smaller cells keeping prisoners in complete isolation.

The opposite end of the station is a headquarters for a local detachment of arresters. The main level includes two meeting rooms, an office for the commander, and a break room. The upper level provides working space where arresters can interview suspects and complete paperwork, as well as space for storing evidence. The lower level includes a morgue and a large area where the whole local force can be assembled.

![[086-406.png|right|300]]

### Azorius Villains
Examples of Azorius villains appear in the Azorius Villains table.

##### Azorius Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An ambitious authority figure seeks to achieve a higher rank by framing or defaming a rival. |
| 2 | A venal judge's rulings are swayed by bribes and favors. |
| 3 | A vengeful imperator persecutes a certain group of people, seeking revenge for a past wrong done by one of the group's members. |
| 4 | An overzealous imperator is prepared to arrest a neighborhood full of people to find a stolen item. |
| 5 | A sadistic warden tortures prisoners, ostensibly for the sake of law and order. |
| 6 | A corrupt senator seeks to pass laws that favor a certain class of people. |
| 7 | A **precognitive mage** invents visions designed to frame enemies. |
| 8 | A cowardly bureaucrat destroys evidence to hide someone else's involvement in a crime. |

#### Azorius as Campaign Villains
The Azorius become villains when they abuse the power of the law. A local magistrate might imprison innocent people, or the senate might pass oppressive legislation, thereby drawing the ire of the Boros and the Selesnya, who care about the folk who get caught in the crosshairs. Arresters might decide to crack down on unsafe Izzet laboratory practices, illegal **Rakdos** performances, or the Gruul presence in the city. Self-righteous prison wardens or precinct captains might abuse their authority in the name of the law, and corrupt bureaucrats might use their positions to garner favors for themselves and their relatives.

Low-level characters might suffer harassment at the hands of overzealous arresters. As the campaign progresses, they might be able to identify a particular imperator who is driving this heightened aggression, who then becomes something of a nemesis for them. As they gain experience, this imperator continues to be a thorn in their side and advances through the ranks of the senate as well, becoming a minister and eventually the arbiter who dictates law enforcement policy for the entire guild. Along the way, this villain uses every available means to hinder the characters, probably veering into covert illegal activities (evil means for a good end). The climax of the campaign might involve a violent confrontation with this arbiter and a group of arresters, or a tense verbal argument adjudicated by Supreme Judge **Isperia** herself.

![[087-407.png|right|300]]

### Azorius Character Goals
Characters who are members of the Azorius Senate might be sent on missions of law enforcement by their superiors or contacts in the guild, and trusted characters might be tasked with apprehending criminals without killing them. The examples on the Azorius Assignments table might be side quests specific to an Azorius character, undertaken while a party of adventurers is engaged in a larger mission.

##### Azorius Assignments
| d6 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Find and arrest a wanted fugitive. |
| 2 | Arrest someone identified as a potential criminal by precognitive mages. |
| 3 | Clear the name of an innocent person. |
| 4 | Solve a murder by questioning suspects. |
| 5 | Retrieve a stolen item. |
| 6 | Quell a riot. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The Azorius Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures involving the Azorius Senate.

##### Azorius Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A **precognitive mage** has identified the characters as future criminals, and now there's a warrant out for their arrest. |
| 2 | A **precognitive mage** has foreseen the characters' future struggles and tries to protect them, thereby interfering in their next adventure. |
| 3 | **Felidars** have bonded with the wrong person and now track an innocent citizen. |
| 4 | Hussars—Azorius **soldiers**  mounted on **griffons**—declare martial law in a neighborhood and enforce their harsh authority on the citizenry. |
| 5 | An **archon of the Triumvirate** interprets innocent actions as illegal ones because its connection to the law has been corrupted. |
| 6 | A missing **homunculus** is the sole witness to the murder of a judge. |

## Boros Legion
Adventures involving the Boros Legion might have a military bent, focusing on small-scale conflict between groups of Boros soldiers and bands of rioters or raiders. The legion is generally a prominent force for law and good in Ravnica, which makes it an appropriate home guild for noble-minded player characters. Its holy bent also makes villains drawn from its ranks particularly dangerous and perhaps tragic.

### Legion Garrison
The Boros Legion maintains garrisons throughout Ravnica, ensuring that every neighborhood has a strong military presence. They range from towering fortresses to small bunkers like the one shown in map 4.2.

#### Legion Garrison Adventures
Designed with defense foremost, a Boros garrison is well suited for adventures that challenge the characters to find a way in or fight their way out. The Legion Garrison Adventures table offers a number of possibilities.

##### Legion Garrison Adventures
| d12 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Lay siege to the garrison. |
| 2 | Break a siege at the garrison. |
| 3 | Sabotage the building's defenses so someone else can break into the garrison. |
| 4 | Find a hidden explosive charge in the garrison before it detonates. |
| 5 | Steal a magic weapon held inside the garrison. |
| 6 | Discover evidence that incriminates an officer in the garrison. |
| 7 | Identify a spy among the garrison's soldiers before the spy can escape. |
| 8 | Help a spy get safely out of the garrison without being discovered. |
| 9 | Capture a garrison officer for interrogation. |
| 10 | Shore up the garrison's defenses before an assault. |
| 11 | Clear out the monsters infesting a garrison that was abandoned years ago. |
| 12 | Steal plans for future Boros military action. |

#### Legion Garrison Map
Access to the garrison is limited to a pair of 20-foot-wide walkways elevated above street level and protected by archers behind arrow slits. Two antechambers give the Boros soldiers and angels ample opportunity to screen anyone who seeks to gain entrance. Beyond them is a large hall where troops can be mustered. To one side of the mustering hall is a barracks area, with a kitchen, a mess, food storage, and guest quarters on the other side.

An extensive array of wall niches in the lower tier (at street level) provides storage space for archived records and the like, and a basement beneath that includes food storage and a well for fresh water, enabling the garrison to withstand a long siege.

The upper tier includes more large halls, the commander's quarters and office, and several niches—accessible only by flying from outside the garrison—that serve as living quarters and watch-posts for the angels stationed here. Parapets on the rooftop provide cover for humanoid archers as well, and the broad open space that they surround offers room for training and sparring. Grass-covered ridges separate different training areas and add a contrasting touch of nature's beauty to the otherwise stony building.

### Boros Villains
Examples of Boros villains appear in the Boros Villains table.

##### Boros Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Seeking to avenge a partner's murder, a Wojek League officer turns to vigilantism. |
| 2 | A Boros commander starts preemptively closing Izzet foundries, Simic research chambers, and other locations considered prone to disaster. |
| 3 | Angered at the death of a loved one in a certain neighborhood, a Wojek agent is inciting its residents to revolt, knowing that the Boros will respond with force. |
| 4 | Believing that they are harboring terrorists, a Boros brigadier is slaughtering helpless people in transient communities in the undercity. |
| 5 | A squad of corrupt Boros **soldiers**  is extorting money from local merchants. |
| 6 | A Boros commander under the thumb of another guild is turning a blind eye to the violence perpetrated by that guild. |
| 7 | An overzealous angel has risen up against innocent people, including the soldiers in her own garrison, believing that they harbor evil in their hearts. |
| 8 | A crazed angel demands to be worshiped as a god. |

#### Boros as Campaign Villains
Not too long ago, the leaders of the Boros Legion valued zeal more highly than justice, believing that their military might made their cause right and just. Although the current guildmaster, **Aurelia**, has reversed her stance on the issue, some voices within the legion still espouse these views. Boros villains are typically intolerant, self-righteous warmongers who abuse their power in pursuit of their own private visions of justice. And because the lower echelons of the guild are taught to follow orders without question, even the villains among the Boros can command companies of soldiers to help them carry out their schemes.

![[089-409.png|right|300]]

Boros villains are inclined to engage in activity that involves pursuing one's passion, acquiring power, or exacting retribution. The Boros make good campaign antagonists if the adventurers represent the forces of chaos that the legion opposes—**Rakdos** revelers, Gruul raiders, Golgari corrupters, or Dimir spies.

You could structure a campaign around the legion's slow progress in taking over the authority of the Azorius Senate and imposing a sort of martial law on the city. A campaign of this sort is particularly effective if the characters initially work alongside the Boros, especially if one or more characters belong to the legion. They might help Boros soldiers drive off Gruul raiders or uproot Dimir spies—clearly fighting against evil on the side of the good and just. As time goes on, though, their Boros allies might start taking their war against evil too far. Innocent citizens get caught in the crossfire, most punishment is cruel and excessive, and any resistance is met with overwhelming force, to "set an example" for anyone else who might consider opposing the legion. A Boros ally (or even a close friend) of the characters might become fully caught up in this fervor. Perhaps the characters can talk some sense into their old friend, but the resolution of the campaign might force them to take more extreme measures to curb the legion's excesses.

### Boros Character Goals
The Boros Legion sends individuals or small parties on small-scale military missions, usually to help quell riots or protect bystanders from dangerous situations. Trusted characters might also be involved in internal investigations of suspected wrongdoing, especially if they're associated with the Wojek League. The Boros Assignments table provides examples of missions or side quests that Boros characters might undertake.

##### Boros Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Help quell a **Rakdos** riot or hold back Gruul raiders, or otherwise maintain the peace while protecting innocent bystanders. |
| 2 | Capture or kill a Gruul chieftain who has taken responsibility for a series of brutal raids. |
| 3 | Help evacuate citizens from the area of a natural or magical disaster. |
| 4 | Escort an important person safely from one place to another. |
| 5 | Investigate a Boros commander suspected of cultivating personal loyalty in underlings, rather than loyalty to the legion. |
| 6 | Uncover a spy in the legion. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The Boros Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Boros Legion.

##### Boros Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A Boros officer is awaiting trial for unsanctioned and excessive use of force, and the officer's squad is planning a jailbreak. |
| 2 | The Boros are secretly working with the Shattergang Brothers, a group of black market arms dealers, to develop a devastating weapon. |
| 3 | A Boros offensive is displacing and even killing innocent bystanders caught in its path. |
| 4 | Flame-kin soldiers created as part of an abandoned weapons project are suddenly reactivated and run amok. These soldiers use the **azer** stat block in the *Monster Manual*. |
| 5 | A Boros parade meant as a show of strength provokes widespread protests, some of which erupt into violence. |
| 6 | A flying Boros fortress is about to crash, threatening to devastate the neighborhood below. |

## House Dimir
Masters of misdirection, infiltration, and espionage, Dimir spies and assassins pursue their objectives behind layers of deception. Dimir agents make ideal villains for adventures involving intrigue and mystery in the shadows of dark alleys and the tunnels of the undercity.

### Safe House
House Dimir maintains safe houses throughout Ravnica, many of them tucked away in the undercity, for guild members who need to elude the ready reach of the law. These sites are protected by magical wards that confuse and misdirect all who approach—in particular, spells that make intruders forget where they are or what they're doing there.

A safe house can also be used to hold prisoners for interrogation, with its protections equally effective in preventing escape and in deterring intruders. Often, a single site serves both purposes.

Map 4.3 presents the floor plan of a typical Dimir safe house.

#### Safe House Adventures
The first task in almost any mission involving a Dimir safe house is to find the place. Most people who have been to a safe house or its environs have no memory of the event, thanks to Dimir mind magic.

The Safe House Adventures table offers some reasons why characters might need to visit such a location. In addition, you could use any other guild's sample location as the site for a location-based adventure, with a simple mission: uncover a Dimir spy in that location.

##### Safe House Adventures
| d12 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Find a fugitive hiding in the safe house. |
| 2 | Liberate someone being held in the safe house. |
| 3 | Retrieve a stolen item. |
| 4 | Get information from a prisoner in the safe house without revealing that information to the Dimir. |
| 5 | Acquire information from a Dimir agent to unmask a spy embedded in another guild. |
| 6 | Escape from captivity in the safe house. |
| 7 | Plant a magical surveillance device inside the safe house. |
| 8 | Damage or destroy the safe house so the Dimir can't use it anymore. |
| 9 | Prevent the creation of a horror (a **flying horror**, **shadow horror**, or a **skittering horror**) in the safe house. (You can replace the horror with a different creature from the *Monster Manual*.) |
| 10 | Find and kill a **mind drinker vampire** or other monster that is picking off the safe house's inhabitants. |
| 11 | Disable the safe house's wards and plant a beacon inside it so that members of another guild can find and raid the place. |
| 12 | After stumbling into the safe house accidentally, get out with memories intact. |

#### Safe House Map
This safe house is a domed building encased in a stone exoskeleton characteristic of Dimir construction. The ground level is a comfortable living space that features accommodations for at least five people. It has five bedrooms, abundant storage space, a central lounge, a recreation space, a dining room, a kitchen, and a pantry.

A secret door in the back of a shared closet leads to a spiral staircase that descends to the basement, which contains three small holding cells. A watch post at the end of the hall allows a guard to keep an eye on the cells and anyone coming down the stairs. An interrogation room can be outfitted with equipment designed to extract information. One-way mirrors offer a view on the interrogation proceedings from an observation room.

![[090-410.png|right|300]]

> ##### Safe House Wards
>You can make a Dimir safe house hard to find and hard to get into by using some of these options:
>
>- The safe house is underground and accessible only through a maze of tunnels and crevices.
>- The area surrounding the house is protected by a guards and wards spell. Navigating the ancient underground corridors or the modern alleyways above ground becomes more complicated when intersections are clouded by fog, doors are hidden and magically locked, and magical compulsions drive visitors away.
>- A glyph of warding might cast fear, phantasmal force, or crown of madness on a character who triggers it—or simply explode in a blast of cold energy.
>- Dimir agents might use alarm spells to ensure that they know when intruders are approaching the safe house.

### Dimir Villains
The Dimir can be masterfully sly villains. Example villains appear in the Dimir Villains table.

##### Dimir Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A spy seeks to plunder another guild's secrets. |
| 2 | A **mind mage** is hunting down everyone who witnessed a great humiliation to expunge their memories of the event. |
| 3 | A **mind mage** has implanted false memories of a crime in many minds in order to incriminate someone. |
| 4 | A group of Dimir agents is plundering the minds of people who have knowledge of a vault that holds great wealth or magical power. |
| 5 | After a Dimir spy is unmasked, a **mind mage** erases the memory of the spy's identity from the minds of those involved. |
| 6 | A shapeshifter has replaced a high-ranking member of another guild in order to provoke conflicts. |
| 7 | A **mind drinker vampire** is plundering the minds of its victims. |
| 8 | Roll on another guild's villain table, but the villain is a disguised Dimir agent or someone being manipulated by the Dimir. |

#### Dimir as Campaign Villains
![[091-411.png|right|300]]

Dimir villains favor schemes involving captivity and coercion, defamation, impersonation and disguise, murder, politics, theft, and torture. Perhaps the most insidious technique employed by the Dimir is the erasing and modifying of memories.

Because their tendrils reach into every other guild, Dimir villains could turn out to be the link between plots that initially seem to be unconnected. Even when individual missions might be straightforward dungeon crawls or battles in the streets, the campaign revolves around the mystery of determining the true villain.

At low and middle levels, the characters might find themselves engaged in important but apparently unrelated tasks. They might kill or drive off a monster that is lairing in an abandoned arrester station (unwittingly clearing the way for a Dimir agent to be placed in the station). They might help the Boros capture a dangerous **Rakdos** ringleader (who is actually a Dimir agent working to destabilize Azorius influence). They might unmask a Dimir spy within one of their own guilds (who is an internal rival of the Dimir villain).

As the characters advance in level, they might come to realize that a powerful and ambitious Azorius figure is going too far in spying on the populace, despite that guild's great success in using precognitive mages to arrest evildoers—especially Dimir spies. Ultimately, the Azorius villain is revealed to be a high-ranking Dimir agent, a confidant of **Lazav** or even **Lazav** himself, who is trying to take over the Azorius Senate and turn it into a surveillance and espionage organization under the villain's control.

### Dimir Character Goals
Characters who are members of House Dimir are spies and saboteurs. It's possible to let these characters experience all the most enjoyable tropes of the spy genre while skirting the more sinister aspects of House Dimir.

The missions on the Dimir Assignments table can work for a team of Dimir agents or as secret missions for a Dimir character to pursue under the cover of the larger adventure plot.

##### Dimir Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Impersonate an individual to gather information from that individual's contacts and associates. |
| 2 | Make sure that a particular person (not a main antagonist) at an adventure site doesn't survive the encounter with the characters. |
| 3 | Make sure that a particular person (not the main villain) survives the adventure. |
| 4 | Get information from the main villain by magically extracting the villain's dying thoughts. |
| 5 | Plant evidence to steer the other adventurers away from the true villain. |
| 6 | Get information to a Dimir agent who is embedded in the adventure location. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The Dimir Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around House Dimir.

##### Dimir Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The characters find a bundle of *thought strands*, and Dimir agents are in a rush to find them before they fade away. |
| 2 | A rogue agent hunted by Dimir assassins offers crippling information about House Dimir in exchange for protection. |
| 3 | A Dimir horror (a **flying horror**, **shadow horror**, or a **skittering horror**) is randomly killing people in the dark alleys of a particular neighborhood. |
| 4 | Word is out that someone claims to have a list of Dimir agents embedded in other guilds, igniting a furious contest to obtain the list. |
| 5 | While prying too deeply into ancient lore, a Dimir agent (now deceased) released a nameless evil into the city. |
| 6 | Roll on another guild's adventure hooks table, but the Dimir are secretly behind the situation. |

## Golgari Swarm
A dominant force in the undercity, the Golgari Swarm is ideally suited for dungeon-based adventures. The Golgari represent corruption and decay, counting many villains among their ranks even though most members are mainly concerned with the balance of the natural cycle of life and death.

### Undercity Mansion
The Golgari are a strange underground aristocracy in a city that mostly lacks a noble class; they are like throwbacks to an ancient time when one's birth determined one's station. The mansion depicted in map 4.4 is a stately relic of such a time—a grand hall that happens to be buried hundreds of feet beneath the streets of Ravnica.

#### Undercity Mansion Adventures
The Undercity Mansion Adventures table provides some possible challenges based in and around the Golgari undercity mansion.

##### Undercity Mansion Adventures
| d10 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Find the source of a noxious fog rising from the undercity and poisoning a surface neighborhood. |
| 2 | Rescue several citizens being held hostage by Ochran agents. |
| 3 | Find the daytime lair of an elusive monster that hunts on the surface at night. |
| 4 | Rescue a guild member petrified by an **undercity medusa** that uses the mansion as its lair. |
| 5 | Take shelter in the mansion to escape a horrible monster prowling the undercity. |
| 6 | Win a bet by surviving a night inside. |
| 7 | Escape from captivity here. |
| 8 | Find a fugitive hiding here. |
| 9 | Find and claim a treasure hidden in the mansion. |
| 10 | Attend a masked ball held in the mansion in order to get information from another guest. |

#### Undercity Mansion Map
This structure is built in a large depression, perhaps part of Deadbridge Chasm. A bridge crosses just above it, and a wide, curving stair leads down from the bridge to the grand ballroom on the top level of the mansion. The rest of the structure is built down from there, with the main, elegant halls and parlors on the second level. Notably, a wide hallway on this level connects with a passage leading to other areas of the undercity. A couple of areas on this floor have crumbled with the weight of the ages, but the place retains its stately grandeur.

The bottom level might be a basement excavated in the floor of a chasm, or it could hang above still more open space like a giant stalactite. It includes living quarters for the owners, servants, and guests.

![[092-412.png|right|300]]

### Golgari Villains
Examples of Golgari villains appear in the Golgari Villains table.

##### Golgari Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Armed with a powerful magic item found among the dead in the undercity, a **Golgari shaman** enacts a plan of revenge against another guild. |
| 2 | A **kraul death priest** is seeking a way to revive the ancient gods of Ravnica and destroy the world. |
| 3 | A **Devkarin lich** is capturing living subjects and infecting them with an insidious, mind-controlling fungus. |
| 4 | A trophy-hunting **undercity medusa** for the stat block) is on a killing spree, petrifying victims in interesting poses. |
| 5 | A **Golgari shaman** is spreading a fungal infection that transforms its dead victims into **zombies**. |
| 6 | An elf child lures citizens into the sewers, where a monstrous "pet" is waiting to kill and eat them. |
| 7 | Pursuing a personal vendetta, an Ochran **assassin** is targeting members of a certain guild and trying to ensure that their bodies are never found. |
| 8 | A **kraul death priest**, angry at the way the Golgari have treated the kraul in the past, is killing the elves and medusas of the guild, hoping to eventually take Jarad's place as guildmaster. |

#### Golgari as Campaign Villains
Given their affinity for death, necromancy, and decay, the Golgari make excellent villains. Because they consider life and death as equal parts of the natural cycle, they have no qualms about subjecting entire neighborhoods to poisonous gas or strangling vines to achieve their various goals. When a Golgari assassin goes on a killing spree, when a patch of their vegetative growth begins "reclaiming" an area that isn't yet abandoned, or when their fungus-bearing zombies emerge from the undercity to haunt the city streets, heroes are duty bound to act against the threat.

![[093-413.png|right|300]]

The Golgari possess a combination of ambition and ruthlessness that makes them extremely dangerous adversaries. The tension among the various factions of the swarm (the elves, the medusas, the kraul, and the rising erstwhile) adds an element of instability to the mix. But perhaps the Golgari Swarm's most dangerous quality is the widespread confidence among its members that it will survive any catastrophe that might befall the surface world. This certainty means Golgari villains will stop at nothing in an attempt to provoke such an event—triggering a virulent plague, causing explosive plant growth, or inciting the other guilds into open war, for example. Over the course of a campaign, a group of adventurers might foil Golgari plans to accomplish all these things, or the characters might be constantly struggling against one ongoing disaster.

For example, the characters might spend the early part of the campaign resolving disputes between guilds, unaware that the Golgari are actually the instigators of those conflicts. Perhaps incidental to these missions, they also face a spore druid who is in the early stages of testing a terrible plague. Then, as the campaign reaches higher levels, the plague breaks out again, this time spreading rapidly. The crisis heightens tensions among the other guilds, especially when food sources are threatened. At the climax of the campaign, the heroes must defuse conflict among the guilds while finding a way to get at the druid at the cause of it all, who is locked in an undercity mansion waiting out the catastrophe.

### Golgari Character Goals
Characters who are members of the Golgari Swarm might be sent on missions into the undercity, particularly jobs that involve retrieval or salvage. The secretive agents of the Ochran are more likely to pursue goals that call for theft or even assassination, while shamans could participate in the swarm's work of "reclamation" in surface neighborhoods. The Golgari Assignments table reflects this range of possibilities. An assignment can also serve as a side quest for Golgari adventurers to undertake while pursuing a larger goal with a mixed-guild party.

##### Golgari Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Find a valuable item believed lost in the undercity. |
| 2 | Retrieve a corpse in the undercity. |
| 3 | Collect a sample of a fungus in the undercity. |
| 4 | Steal something that is important to another guild. |
| 5 | Kill an outspoken enemy of the Golgari. |
| 6 | Position a fungus so that its spores will spread into a populated area and drive the inhabitants out. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The Golgari Adventure Hooks table offers ideas for additional adventures themed around the Golgari Swarm.

##### Golgari Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Citizens who die in a particular neighborhood sprout fungal growths and rise as **zombies**, then shamble toward the undercity. |
| 2 | **Shriekers** sprout throughout a neighborhood. |
| 3 | **Swarms of insects** under the control of a **Golgari shaman** terrorize a neighborhood. |
| 4 | Poor people who subsist on Golgari food contract a dangerous, contagious magical infection. |
| 5 | Several kraul have moved into an old tenement and are making their neighbors nervous. |
| 6 | A beloved statue, long assumed to be the image of some forgotten community hero, suddenly returns to life after being petrified for a hundred years. |

## Gruul Clans
![[094-414.png|right|300]]

An adventure involving the Gruul Clans typically revolves around combat. The Gruul provide characters with opportunities to fight huge monsters and vicious berserkers. The Gruul bring chaos and destruction with them wherever they go, so they can easily disrupt and complicate adventures involving any other guild. Any time an adventure needs an injection of brutal violence, the Gruul are a good tool for the purpose.

### Rubblebelt Encampment
The Gruul have no interest in the buildings, streets, and markets of Ravnica, except as targets for their raids. The encampment shown in map 4.5 represents a temporary shelter in the ruins, the sort of place the Gruul might call home for a time.

#### Rubblebelt Encampment Adventures
Many Gruul adventures begin with a raid into a settled part of the city. Adventurers might be able to follow the raiders back to their camp—for the sake of revenge, in an effort to retrieve something, or perhaps in chains.

##### Rubblebelt Encampment Adventures
| d10 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Determine why the Gruul have camped so close to a settled neighborhood. |
| 2 | Free a captive taken in a recent raid. |
| 3 | Win freedom by defeating a Gruul champion in a duel. |
| 4 | Retrieve something looted in a recent raid. |
| 5 | Strike a deal with the Gruul leader to cooperate against a common foe. |
| 6 | Attempt to overthrow the clan chieftain in a combat challenge. |
| 7 | Strike a blow to the Gruul to ensure that they don't launch a raid. |
| 8 | Free a corralled herd of violent beasts so they stampede through the Gruul camp before the Gruul can steer them toward settled areas. |
| 9 | Interrupt a ritual intended to summon or create a huge elemental. |
| 10 | Disrupt a gathering of clans that could lead to an alliance between them. |

#### Rubblebelt Encampment Map
Built in a plaza surrounded by crumbling ruins, this camp offers some defensive advantages to its Gruul residents. An old tower is the one intact structure the Gruul use, because it offers a good vantage point over the surrounding area. A sluiceway provides potable water, and a handful of scraggly trees are a reminder of nature's potential to grow and flourish even among the ruins.

Otherwise, the camp is little more than a handful of tents around a bonfire. A trash pit serves as a means of waste disposal, a few makeshift cages can hold prisoners, and a partially enclosed area to one side has been converted into a pen for the beasts used by the Gruul.

![[095-415.png|right|300]]

### Gruul Villains
The Gruul are straightforward villains, employing direct action and violence to tear down civilized society. They aren't schemers, and they have little patience for political maneuvering. Their cunning is that of a hunter stalking its prey, and the threat they pose is rampant, aggressive destruction. Examples of Gruul villains appear in the Gruul Villains table.

##### Gruul Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A **druid of the Old Ways**, spurred by visions of the end of civilization, plans humanoid sacrifices in the name of Ilharg the Raze-Boar. |
| 2 | A druid is directing herds of beasts to run amok through tenement neighborhoods. |
| 3 | A druid summons huge vines and roots to tear buildings down. |
| 4 | A clan chieftain leads a raid to settle a personal vendetta against another guild. |
| 5 | In a display of strength, a clan chieftain seeks to destroy a significant landmark. |
| 6 | Looking for a totem of spiritual significance, a clanless giant wrecks anything in its path. |
| 7 | Hoping to form a new clan, a clever centaur tries to break violent criminals out of jail. |
| 8 | A druid leads a band that has begun starting fires around the district. |

#### Gruul as Campaign Villains
Using the Gruul Clans as the main antagonists in a campaign could be an opportunity to explore the apocalyptic religious beliefs of the Old Ways—the expectation of the return of an ancient god, Ilharg the Raze-Boar.

At low levels, characters could be drawn into seemingly coincidental clashes with the Gruul, perhaps as minor events in adventures that involve other guilds. Only later does a pattern emerge: the raids correspond with certain astronomical events, the movements of wurms, or another sign that the druids of the Old Ways consider significant. As the adventurers' power grows, so does that of the Gruul druids behind the trouble, and soon the druids are actually instigating natural disasters—earthquakes and mighty storms, for example. As the campaign reaches its climax, the Gruul Clans all come together to perform an enormous ritual meant to summon the Raze-Boar and bring an end to civilization on Ravnica—and the adventurers must stop it.

### Gruul Character Goals
The goals shown on the Gruul Assignments table can be objectives in themselves, or side quests that a Gruul character pursues in the course of undertaking an adventure with a larger purpose.

##### Gruul Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Collect a beast cub so it can be trained for battle. |
| 2 | Slay a powerful monster to prove your strength. |
| 3 | Destroy a laboratory, a work of engineering, or a similar edifice of decadent civilization. |
| 4 | Kill someone who has been persecuting the Gruul. |
| 5 | Free a captive warrior who was imprisoned during a recent raid. |
| 6 | Create a disruption so the clan can raid elsewhere. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The Gruul Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Gruul Clans.

##### Gruul Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Conflict between two feuding clans spills onto the streets of the city, threatening to destroy entire neighborhoods. |
| 2 | Gruul **anarchs** deface or destroy monuments throughout the district. |
| 3 | A Gruul mob riots in the streets in observance of Rauck-Chauv, a holiday celebrated with violence. |
| 4 | A **wurm** breaks free of its Gruul controller and goes on a rampage. |
| 5 | Swine everywhere run wild, and the Gruul interpret this as a sign of the Raze-Boar's return. |
| 6 | Gruul raiders steal something from an Izzet laboratory that will cause a disaster if it isn't returned. |

## Izzet League
Adventures involving the Izzet League typically concern magical mishaps, dangerous inventions, and feats of engineering (for good or ill). Player characters might be called upon to help clean up in the aftermath of a magical disaster, contain the damage, or rein in an ongoing danger. Or they could test or steal or destroy Izzet inventions, perhaps inadvertently causing magical catastrophes in the process.

### Experimental Workshop
![[096-416.png|right|300]]

The fundamental responsibility of the Izzet League is building and maintaining Ravnica's infrastructure, and the guild's work is responsible for many of the magical–technological conveniences that make life in the city relatively safe and comfortable, from paved roadways to running water. Under the leadership of the draconic genius **Niv-Mizzet**, the Izzet have continued to innovate, taking their work far beyond the essential needs of infrastructure and into the realm of wild invention. As a result, the workshops and laboratories of the Izzet are prone to magical mishaps, with results that range from personal injury to district-wide destruction. It is perhaps best for Ravnica as a whole that most of Izzet's work takes place in small workshops scattered throughout the city, rather than being concentrated in one place (with the guildhall of Nivix being the notable exception).

#### Experimental Workshop Adventures
Izzet workshops like the one depicted in map 4.6 are notable for three things: the brilliant minds at work there, the incredible inventions they produce, and the destructive events that can occur when things go wrong. Adventurers might be drawn to a workshop to steal, thwart, or protect any of those things. The Experimental Workshop Adventures table shows some examples.

##### Experimental Workshop Adventures
| d12 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Rescue people trapped in the workshop after a disaster. |
| 2 | Steal plans or a prototype for a new weapon. |
| 3 | Capture an inventor for interrogation. |
| 4 | Stop the spread of toxic gas or molten mizzium from inside the workshop. |
| 5 | Shut down the operation of a dangerous device. |
| 6 | Capture or kill an elemental or an Izzet weird (a **blistercoil weird** or **galvanice weird**) that is running amok in the workshop, and make sure it doesn't escape out into the city. |
| 7 | Get out of the workshop before it is destroyed by a spreading catastrophe. |
| 8 | Destroy the workshop in order to obliterate the research being done there. |
| 9 | Destroy the workshop in order to bring down a different building nearby. |
| 10 | Find a saboteur in the workshop before the traitor's plans can be enacted. |
| 11 | Kill an inventor whose ideas are too dangerous to be put into practice. |
| 12 | Activate an invention being held in storage in the workshop. |

#### Experimental Workshop Map
An Izzet workshop is a chaotic place, buzzing with energy and activity. A mana generator in the basement fuels all the experimentation and construction above. The generator draws power from the city infrastructure, and ultimately from the Blistercoils, but the construction depicted in map 4.6 is designed to amplify and focus the magical energy. The machinery is fragile, so visitors are strongly discouraged from entering the basement.

Some parts of the generator extend up to the ground floor and the laboratory mezzanine above it, with portions of those floors open to the basement or covered only by metal grates. The ground level is typically cluttered with devices attached to the generator below, as well as cast-off pieces of such devices, awaiting new homes in new inventions. The laboratory mezzanine includes three spaces where projects can be developed in isolation, with thick walls providing some shielding from potentially explosive results. Additional equipment related to the generator system is housed in a tower and on the workshop's roof, culminating in a storm siphon that can harness and channel atmospheric energy (including lightning).

The Bizarre Magical Effects table provides suggestions for the sort of events that might result from a failed (or successful!) Izzet experiment, which can add spice to any Izzet adventure.

### Izzet Villains
The behavior that members of the Izzet League display most often is careless disregard for safety, which causes frequent upheavals on both small and large scales. The true villains among the Izzet, though, aren't just accident-prone but also committed to widespread destruction. Out of madness or despair, they might plot the destruction of precincts or districts. Hungry for profit and power, they develop weapons capable of destroying large groups of people and commit crimes to get the resources they need to complete their research.

The Izzet Villains table includes examples of villains as well as those who have less sinister intentions.

##### Izzet Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A disgraced member of the Izmundi tries to embarrass the guild by orchestrating a magical disaster. |
| 2 | A team of inventors is creating a secret arsenal of volatile weapons. |
| 3 | Trying to impress the guildmaster, a mage from the Laboratory of Storms and Electricity creates a device that pushes the weather from one extreme to another. |
| 4 | A researcher siphons power from the Blistercoils to fuel experiments, causing failures in parts of the city's infrastructure. |
| 5 | An obsessive researcher, trying to perfect an alchemical formula, causes a series of ever-worsening laboratory mishaps. |
| 6 | A guild leader orchestrates a series of "accidental" laboratory explosions that are actually meant to disrupt the nearby activities of other guilds. |
| 7 | An imprisoned spellcaster stages an explosive prison break using improvised materials. |
| 8 | A suspicious spellcaster who can't trust research secrets to others creates clones that run amok. |

#### Izzet as Campaign Villains
A campaign involving the Izzet League could revolve around an Izzet researcher's efforts to gain personal power or greater influence for the guild through the wonders of modern magical science.

At low levels, the characters might help deal with a small-scale mishap in an Izzet workshop that is presumed to be an accident. Maybe something in the manner of the responsible researcher stirs up their suspicion, but there's no evidence of wrongdoing at this point. As the campaign progresses, the characters might continue having run-ins with the same researcher, whose work seems to be growing more dangerous. Eventually, they discover evidence that this researcher is developing weapons to use against the other guilds, and as a result the researcher has to move to a secret workshop, perhaps tucked away in the undercity. Or perhaps the guildmaster intervenes, declares this issue to be an internal matter for the Izzet to resolve, and assures the authorities that the researcher will be properly dealt with. As the campaign reaches its climax, the adventurers are tasked with discovering the researcher's secret laboratory and disabling the super-weapon.

![[098-418.png|right|300]]

### Izzet Character Goals
Characters who are connected with the Izzet League might be asked to run errands for higher-ranked researchers, or to take on more difficult tasks on behalf of colleagues. The Izzet Assignments table provides examples of goals that can serve as adventure hooks for a party or as side quests for an Izzet character to pursue in the course of a larger adventure.

##### Izzet Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Acquire a hard-to-find metal or energy source. |
| 2 | Copy a rival's research notes. |
| 3 | Destroy a rival's research. |
| 4 | Take measurements of an unusual object or location (such as spatial dimensions or readings of various magical levels). |
| 5 | Test a new invention. |
| 6 | Repair an important piece of Ravnica's infrastructure, such as a water main or a boiler pipe, that is tucked away in a remote location. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The Izzet Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Izzet League.

##### Izzet Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An Izzet experiment transforms a researcher, who then seeks help in returning to normal form. |
| 2 | An escaped Izzet weird (a **blistercoil weird** or **galvanice weird**) is causing magical malfunctions around the district. |
| 3 | A researcher trying to craft an antigravity alloy for a personal flight apparatus has created a number of *reverse gravity* effects, and is now trapped in midair at the top of one. |
| 4 | After a laboratory explosion, an alchemical fire resistant to conventional firefighting techniques is spreading through several neighborhoods. |
| 5 | A reckless researcher triggered an explosion in a mizzium foundry, causing a wave of molten metal to spill out into the surrounding streets. |
| 6 | A researcher who claims to have traveled back in time warns of an impending disaster. |

## Orzhov Syndicate
The Orzhov Syndicate is a sprawling network of organized crime that operates behind a facade of legitimate banking, robed in the trappings of religion. Adventures involving the Orzhov often include some combination of fighting their criminal activities, interacting with their wealth, and dealing with the haunting spirits and sinister monsters that make up a significant part of the guild's leadership.

### Grand Basilica
Combining the guild's interests in organized crime, banking, and religion, Orzhov properties are ornate basilicas as grand as any cathedral, though the business conducted within them is driven by greed and lust for power rather than altruistic motives. Each location includes a grand space used not for purposes of worship, but to ensure that petitioners feel small and abased before the Orzhov oligarchs. Its lower level contains vaults to store the ill-gotten riches of its leaders, as well as crypts that hold the corpses of family members whose spirits might still be active above.

#### Grand Basilica Adventures
An adventure in an Orzhov basilica, like the one shown in map 4.7, can feel like the action in a gangster movie, a bank heist, or the exploration of a haunted house. The Grand Basilica Adventures table provides some examples.

##### Grand Basilica Adventures
| d12 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Steal (or recover) a magic item from the vaults below the basilica. |
| 2 | Put an end to nightly visitations by finding and confronting the haunting spirit in the basilica. |
| 3 | Survive a night trapped inside the basilica. |
| 4 | Deliver a warning to an Orzhov pontiff in the basilica and get out alive. |
| 5 | Rescue a prisoner being held in the basilica's spire or crypts. |
| 6 | Escape from captivity in the basilica's spire or crypts. |
| 7 | Destroy a dangerous weapon stored in a vault beneath the basilica. |
| 8 | Acquire or destroy some incriminating evidence held by an Orzhov blackmailer. |
| 9 | Retrieve a precious item held as collateral by an Orzhov loan shark. |
| 10 | Get information from a spirit who knew something important in life. |
| 11 | Find concrete evidence of the syndicate's illegal activities. |
| 12 | Discover the fate of someone who was last seen entering the basilica a week ago. |

#### Orzhov Basilica Map
The Orzhov basilica is a huge church with the primary function of intimidating those who come to confess, atone, borrow, or pay. The nave features lofty archways, towering statues of proud oligarchs, and a huge central statue that depicts the Ghost Council surrounded by supplicants. A pair of tall doors behind the statue leads to a sanctuary where minor treasures—worth more than most citizens will ever see in their lives, but less than the true treasures hidden in the vaults—are put on display to encourage devotion. Another statue of a patron oligarch (usually the basilica's founder) stands at the end of this room, flanked by spiral staircases leading up into the spire and down to the crypts. The stairs are secured behind ornate wrought iron gates.

The three levels of the spire hold luxurious apartments where living oligarchs dwell. The doors can be locked from the outside, making them also suitable for holding valuable prisoners.

The crypts and vaults below the basilica hold the bones of ancient oligarchs and their most cherished treasures. Some crypts contain just bones, others just valuables, and some hold both. A security station keeps watch on the entire level, and the guards there are typically the only ones who have keys to open the metal portcullises that obstruct the hallway.

![[099-419.png|right|300]]

### Orzhov Villains
Examples of Orzhov villains appear in the Orzhov Villains table.

##### Orzhov Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A powerful pontiff is using the spirits of dead relatives to intimidate members of other guilds. |
| 2 | An angel defected from the Boros Legion, bringing a magic sword with her that the Boros want back. |
| 3 | An Orzhov knight is trying to collect an overdue debt incurred by one of the adventurers' ancestors. |
| 4 | A pontiff is running an extortion racket, promising local businesses protection from thugs that are also in the Orzhov's employ. |
| 5 | A **blood drinker vampire** is holding prisoners as a food supply in a bank vault. |
| 6 | An advokist is exploiting legal loopholes to win the freedom of several criminals from Azorius prisons. |
| 7 | A desperate spirit tries to frighten people into paying its debts so it can pass on. |
| 8 | An unusually quick-witted **Orzhov giant** for the stat block) with grand visions of starting a criminal gang interferes with the flow of protection money. |

#### Orzhov as Campaign Villains
Orzhov villains often scheme to achieve immortality (if they are still alive and have been denied the prospect of becoming a spirit after death), to gain influence, and especially to gather wealth (because too much is never enough). Their favorite methods include coercion, confidence scams (mostly relying on the fine print in magically binding contracts), murder, politics, theft, torture, and vice.

![[100-420.png|right|300]]

You could build a campaign around the Orzhov Syndicate's efforts to gain control of the adventurers. Recognizing the characters as powerful agents for change, one or more pontiffs scheme to make sure that the syndicate can direct that force toward goals of their choosing. In typical Orzhov fashion, that generally means trying to force the characters into debt, either to the Orzhov in general or to an individual pontiff.

At low levels, the Orzhov might be nothing more than a gentle force behind the scenes. If the adventurers need help, an Orzhov agent might appear and offer it. If they commit crimes, the Orzhov find out about it. The characters' valuables can be kept safe in an Orzhov vault, and Orzhov ministrants can provide healing and other clerical magic at reasonable prices.

As the campaign progresses and the characters acquire more influence in their guilds and in the city at large, the Orzhov begin trying to exert pressure. They call in favors in exchange for the help they have previously offered, they make subtle threats about reporting the adventurers' illegal acts, or they point to the fine print in agreements made with the ministrants. Initially, their motives might not be outwardly sinister. (The Orzhov Assignments table can serve as inspiration.) But if the characters work against Orzhov interests, the syndicate interferes more forcefully. All the while, Orzhov leaders are looking for ways to trap the characters under their ghostly thumbs.

As the campaign builds to a climax, the adventurers might be forced to make sacrifices in order to throw off the yoke of Orzhov debt. That turn of events could lead to a confrontation with an undead pontiff or even the entire Obzedat. And if a member of the adventuring party has died along the way, the other characters might find themselves fighting the spirit of their dead companion!

### Orzhov Character Goals
Characters who are members of the Orzhov Syndicate, as well as those who are indebted to the Orzhov, might receive missions or errands that further the interests of their corrupt overlords. The Orzhov Assignments table includes examples of quests and side quests that such characters might undertake.

##### Orzhov Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Convince a debtor to make a payment. |
| 2 | Damage the person or property of someone who refuses to pay protection money. |
| 3 | Distribute alms-coins to the poor. |
| 4 | Transport a chest of coins to an Orzhov bank. |
| 5 | Destroy evidence that implicates the Orzhov in a crime. |
| 6 | Find information that can be used to blackmail a powerful person. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The Orzhov Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Orzhov Syndicate.

##### Orzhov Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Newly minted Orzhov coins are inscribed with a magical symbol that binds the spirit of anyone who uses them. |
| 2 | **Indentured spirits** have been deployed to haunt a location the Orzhov want to keep people away from. |
| 3 | Thrulls (a **servitor thrull** or **winged thrull**) that have broken free of Orzhov control are causing mischief. |
| 4 | Items appear on the black market that were obviously stolen from an Orzhov vault, but no one admits that the theft has occurred or claims credit. |
| 5 | **Gargoyles** perched on structures throughout the city are robbing passersby and delivering their stolen goods to an Orzhov basilica. |
| 6 | An eclipse triggers violent behavior from bound Orzhov spirits. |

## Cult of Rakdos
![[101-421.png|right|300]]

On most worlds, a cult dedicated to an ancient demon lord would be an obvious villain, to be rooted out and exterminated at all costs. On Ravnica, though, the status of the Cult of **Rakdos** isn't so clear-cut. It is a guild like the others, and its existence is mandated by the Guildpact, so exterminating it and its founder would violate the fundamental social order of the world. Although the ranks of **Rakdos** include outright villains who crave blood and mayhem, most of its members are performers who just want to put on a good show. Not every performance ends in violence, and even when a riot does break out, it's not always easy to pin the blame on the entertainers.

Nonetheless, the Cult of **Rakdos** has more than its share of truly villainous members, and the guild provides ample opportunity for adventurers to fight against true evil.

### Notorious Nightclub
Catering to all sorts of demented desires, nightclubs like the one shown in map 4.8 are permanent venues, in contrast to the portable tents and stages set up by **Rakdos** performers in streets and plazas every night. Much of what happens here would be illegal if it weren't consensual—and if the city's rich and powerful weren't as drawn to its forbidden pleasures as anyone else in Ravnica.

#### Notorious Nightclub Adventures
Characters might be drawn to a **Rakdos** nightclub for reasons that have nothing to do with adventuring, but adventures unfold in these places regardless. The Notorious Nightclub Adventures table includes a variety of examples.

##### Notorious Nightclub Adventures
| d12 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Shut down a performance before the performers start attacking the crowd. |
| 2 | Escape from the club once the violence starts. |
| 3 | Protect a thrill seeker who wants to witness a performance close up. |
| 4 | Rescue someone who has been abducted for use as an extra in a show. |
| 5 | Find evidence that someone important was (or was not) killed in a previous performance here. |
| 6 | Capture a performer who ran away from a prominent family to "join the circus." |
| 7 | Use the distraction of a performance to hold a secret meeting with someone from another guild. |
| 8 | Spy on someone who is using the distraction of a performance to hold a secret meeting. |
| 9 | Acquire a magic item the **Rakdos** are using as part of a performance. |
| 10 | Investigate rumors that the **Rakdos** have a wingless angel in their show. |
| 11 | Find an escaped convict who is rumored to be hiding behind **Rakdos** makeup. |
| 12 | Stop a **Rakdos** member who is blackmailing an important person with embarrassing information. |

#### Notorious Nightclub Map
Security, privacy, and terror are the priorities of this nightclub. Visitors are channeled through a large entry vestibule into an upper area with tables tucked away in nooks. From there, they can watch the violent antics of ferocious beasts or performers in cages suspended from the ceiling. Stairs lead down to the area of the main stage, where headlining performances are held. Offices and storage areas fill the rest of the main level.

A second stage in the lower level provides a more up-close experience, which often means audience members are showered in blood or drawn into the show. Several private booths surround the backstage area, with doors that include shuttered windows to enable those inside to keep an eye on the show or carry out private business.

![[102-422.png|right|300]]

### Rakdos Villains
**Rakdos** villains range in power from demented cultists to sadistic demons. Most of them are driven by a desire for unfettered mayhem. A hunger for a certain form of immortality (being an artist who is remembered forever) often feeds that desire, and insofar as **Rakdos** can be considered the "god" of his cult, objectives related to magic—carrying out his wishes, offering him sacrifices, and rousing him into action—are also significant objectives for some cultists. Driven as they are by selfish impulse and emotion, **Rakdos** villains also sometimes pursue schemes related to passion, power, or revenge. Specific examples appear on the **Rakdos** Villains table.

![[103-423.png|right|300]]

##### Rakdos Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A coven of **blood witches**, seeking **Rakdos**'s favor, uses magic to turn members of other guilds against their own allies. |
| 2 | Word spreads that a retiring performer wants to go out with a bang, and their final performance promises to be explosive. |
| 3 | Mocking the absence of the Guildpact, a **Rakdos** troupe takes over the Chamber of the Guildpact and performs its satire before a captive audience. |
| 4 | A demon captures people and makes a game of thwarting their efforts to escape. |
| 5 | A skilled puppeteer uses skeletal marionettes to recreate historical acts of violence between guilds—which are inexplicably repeated in the real world within the next few days. |
| 6 | A ringmaster has discovered magic that fills the whole audience with blood lust and sends them rampaging through the streets. |
| 7 | A hypnotist is programming audience members to go into a murderous rage when a triggering event occurs. |
| 8 | A crazed **blood witch** hopes to rouse **Rakdos** by driving captured sacrificial victims into his lair. |

#### Rakdos as Campaign Villains
You could build a campaign around the Cult of **Rakdos**'s efforts to stir its demonic patron into action against the other guilds. The campaign might unfold amid steadily increasing violence, escalating to episodes of widespread rioting and rampaging demons.

At lower levels, the adventurers might encounter incidental violence spilling over from **Rakdos** venues: a brawl outside a nightclub, overenthusiastic devils spreading fires around a street stage, or the "accidental" death of a few performers at the climax of their act. As the campaign progresses, the characters might be drawn into combating the efforts of blood witches who are trying to exterminate the cult's most active enemies. The more they foil the cult's efforts, the more the characters themselves become targets of both ridicule and violent action.

At the campaign's climax, the adventurers might have to interrupt a ritual performed in **Rakdos**'s lair in order to prevent him from rampaging through the city—or if they are too late to do that, they might have to fight the ancient demon lord himself.

### Rakdos Character Goals
Characters who are members of the Cult of **Rakdos** are expected to be self-motivated and rarely take orders from anyone other than **Rakdos** himself. The **Rakdos** Assignments table includes some suggestions for adventures or side quests that **Rakdos** characters might undertake on their own initiative, or perhaps at the request of a ringmaster or a fellow performer.

##### Rakdos Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Acquire a flashy magic item to use as a prop in a performance. |
| 2 | Try out a new performance routine in the midst of actual life-or-death combat. |
| 3 | Sow distrust of an important person through satire or slander. |
| 4 | Make sure a specific person is in the front row for a certain performance. |
| 5 | Capture a deadly monster for use in a spectacular show. |
| 6 | Interrupt a solemn ceremony or ritual being performed by another guild. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The **Rakdos** Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Cult of **Rakdos**.

##### Rakdos Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Wild-eyed people attending a popular new club seem unwilling or unable to go home after several days of nonstop merriment. |
| 2 | One morning, everyone who has seen a **Rakdos** performance in the past week suddenly transforms into a minor demon. |
| 3 | An apparently spontaneous **Rakdos**-led riot has spread to take over an entire neighborhood. |
| 4 | People who die in **Rakdos**-inspired violence stand back up as **zombies** and keep fighting. |
| 5 | Ordinary knives and chains in homes across the neighborhood seem to come to life in advance of the start of a **Rakdos** show. |
| 6 | After several mausoleums are burst open from the inside, people see their undead family members cavorting on a **Rakdos** stage. |

## Selesnya Conclave
The Selesnya Conclave is most likely to be involved in adventures as a force for good, since many of its members are healers, diplomats, and mediators. It is a natural home for player characters—especially clerics and druids—so it might serve as a patron. Nonetheless, the guild has a militaristic bent, and like nature itself it isn't beyond corruption.

### Vernadi Center
The basic unit of the Conclave's organization is the vernadi—a community centered on a large tree and led by the voda of the enclave, a dryad whose spirit is linked to that tree. From the outside, a vernadi might resemble a peaceful commune, and thus seem to be an easy target for theft or assault. But its temple gardens are protected by soldiers and archers, and even the seemingly serene initiates have some military training.

#### Vernadi Center Adventures
Though a vernadi lacks the defensive fortifications of, for example, a Boros garrison, it is still a difficult place to attack or infiltrate. Because of the sheer numbers of initiates that might be inside, stealth is probably a better tactic than frontal assault. The Vernadi Center Adventures table offers some suggestions.

##### Vernadi Center Adventures
| d12 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Ascertain the numbers of the military forces housed in and around the vernadi. |
| 2 | Find the source of pollen that is drifting through the neighborhood and making people placid and compliant. |
| 3 | Find the source of wind-borne seeds that are drifting through the neighborhood and quickly growing into hostile awakened shrubs. |
| 4 | Retrieve an initiate who was supposedly forced to join the guild through mind-affecting magic. |
| 5 | Stop the vernadi, whose tree has awakened and escaped the control of its dryad, from trampling through the neighborhood. |
| 6 | Find a way to tap into the mind, will, and knowledge of Mat'Selesnya through the vernadi's central tree or its dryad. |
| 7 | Introduce a contagion into Mat'Selesnya through the vernadi's tree or its dryad. |
| 8 | Capture an equenaut who has been accused of a crime and who has taken refuge at the vernadi. |
| 9 | Convince or coerce a healer to tend to a sick or wounded person who would normally be an enemy of the conclave. |
| 10 | Find a spy embedded in the vernadi community. |
| 11 | Blend into the community to avoid pursuers. |
| 12 | Retrieve an item that was donated to the community by a new initiate, but without the permission of the item's owner. |

#### Vernadi Center Map
The temple shown in map 4.9 is at the heart of the vernadi, built in and around a large tree. A circle of white marble with several archways surrounds the base of the tree, encompassing both a decorative garden where meetings are held and a vegetable garden that provides food for the vernadi. The meeting garden includes benches and a fountain of fresh water. Two small buildings at ground level offer rustic accommodations for members of the vernadi or guests.

Gracefully curving ramps sweep around the trunk of the tree, leading to various other small buildings. Several of these are open to the air, offering sheltered places for gatherings or quiet contemplation. Others are apartments where leaders of the vernadi live. Near the top of the tree is a large, round temple space.

![[104-424.png|right|300]]

### Selesnya Villains
True evil is rare among the members of Selesnya, with misplaced religious zeal being the impetus that most commonly pushes its members into acts of villainy.

Examples of Selesnya villains appear in the Selesnya Villains table.

##### Selesnya Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A fanatical leader disrupts building projects because they aren't in harmony with nature. |
| 2 | A Ledev guardian is leading preemptive raids on other guilds, believing that a full-scale attack on the conclave is imminent. |
| 3 | A voda, feeling imperiled by the ills of society, causes vines to grow and seal the members of her vernadi inside. |
| 4 | A militant leader of a splinter group harasses "unbelievers" on the street and threatens to unleash elemental power on them. |
| 5 | A loxodon evangel uses coercive methods to recruit young people into the conclave. |
| 6 | An elf seeking spiritual union with Mat'Selesnya threatens the dryad of their own vernadi. |
| 7 | A crazed prophet claims to be the incarnation of Mat'Selesnya and gathers an army to strike at other guilds. |
| 8 | A **horncaller** steals animals that were used as pets, mounts, and beasts of burden throughout the neighborhood. |

![[105-425.png|right|300]]

#### Selesnya as Campaign Villains
You could structure a campaign around the efforts of the Selesnya Conclave to finally bring all of Ravnica into its welcoming embrace.

At lower levels, Selesnya might be an ally to the player characters, offering support in the form of healing and other magic. By the time the characters reach middle levels, Selesnya emerges as a threat: perhaps it becomes clear that several vernadi are using magical charms (or other forms of coercion) to win converts, and the conclave might even try to coerce the player characters to join. Eventually, their strategy evolves toward extortion and conquest, as they unleash wurms and similar powerful beasts to threaten those who refuse to convert, and they use the might of their armies to eliminate other guilds and bring whole precincts under their control. The climax of the campaign might involve the heroes leading or coordinating the efforts of all nine other guilds to unite against the Selesnya threat.

### Selesnya Character Goals
Characters who are part of the Selesnya Conclave are usually sent into the world to help ease suffering, make peace, win converts, and advance the other objectives of the guild. The Selesnya Assignments table includes a number of side quests for individual Selesnya characters as well as adventure hooks for a whole party.

##### Selesnya Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Work to stop the spread of a strange illness. |
| 2 | Tend to the victims of a catastrophe or an attack. |
| 3 | Mediate a dispute between two other guilds. |
| 4 | Plant a magic seed, watch it grow into a great tree, and defend the tree until reinforcements arrive. |
| 5 | Bring an unruly beast under control and return it to the vernadi it escaped from. |
| 6 | Lead a targeted military strike to warn another guild against overreaching. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The Selesnya Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the conclave.

##### Selesnya Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A sacred tree has been defiled or cut down, and an angry Selesnya mob is gathering to exact revenge. |
| 2 | The Worldsoul has identified the characters as emblematic of their guilds' overreaching ambition. |
| 3 | A seer of the conclave tries to convince the characters that they are fated to save the world. |
| 4 | Plants throughout a neighborhood develop carnivorous tendencies. |
| 5 | A magic-infused stone of a Selesnya building grows out of control, threatening nearby buildings. |
| 6 | A Selesnya **wurm** breaks free of its controller and goes on a rampage. |

## Simic Combine
Adventures that involve the Simic Combine delve into the world of weird magical science. The Simic breed the hybrids known as krasis, and those creations can break free of their controllers and rampage through the city streets. The Simic also infuse sapient races with animal features, creating hybrids with adaptations designed for combat and espionage.

### Growth Chamber
Although most Simic research is concentrated in the nine zonots distributed all over Ravnica, mages affiliated with the guild construct laboratories in various other locations, particularly when they are seeking a particular combination of environmental factors such as air and water temperature, humidity, and ambient light. Growth chambers like the one depicted in map 4.10, built for the creation and incubation of krasis and hybrids, could be located anywhere, from deep in the undercity to the top of a tall spire.

#### Growth Chamber Adventures
Adventures in a growth chamber often involve dealing with Simic experiments. The Growth Chamber Adventures table shows some examples.

##### Growth Chamber Adventures
| d12 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Escape from the chamber while a **category 3 krasis** runs amok through it after breaking out of its growth pod. |
| 2 | Break one or more krasis out of their growth pods in order to wreak havoc on the growth chamber. |
| 3 | Stop a sinister experiment in progress. |
| 4 | Spy on a research program intended to create superior soldiers. |
| 5 | Subtly sabotage a research program so that it fails without the interference being obvious. |
| 6 | Steal research notes from an experiment with broad applications. |
| 7 | Free someone who has become the involuntary subject of Simic experiments. |
| 8 | Discover the source of a form of terraforming magic spreading out from the chamber's location. |
| 9 | Capture a crazed Simic scientist who is trying to use other scientists in the chamber for experimental subjects. |
| 10 | Capture a crazed Simic scientist whose own body has been drastically altered by their experiments. |
| 11 | Acquire the laboratory's technology so it can be put to use by another guild. |
| 12 | Retrieve research notes from a flooded and abandoned laboratory. |

#### Growth Chamber Map
This structure is attached to the side of some other structure, much as a coral affixes itself to a solid surface. It might be built on the inside wall of a zonot or a chasm, or it could abut another building at street level. The chamber consists of a series of overlapping domes with large, green-tinted windows.

The main entrance leads into a lobby with three decorative pools and three functional growth pods showcasing the most innocuous research being done here. The pods are glass and metal devices filled with greenish, vaguely glowing liquid, designed to allow life forms to gestate and grow until they are ready to emerge. The pods might be growing homunculi or category 1 krasis, but it would be highly unusual for the Simic to display the maturation of a hybrid soldier in such a public way. Four smaller growth pods to one side serve the same function. On the other side, a meeting room (containing one more growth pod) offers a place for researchers to meet with outsiders.

The first level above the main floor is dedicated to living, cooking, and eating space for the researchers and others who live here. A single large room acts as a barracks for the scientists, with folding screens offering some degree of privacy.

The other levels of the chamber are entirely dedicated to research and space to grow the laboratory's creations. Growth pods are found in nearly every room.

### Simic Villains
Examples of Simic villains appear in the Simic Villains table.

##### Simic Villains
| d8 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A rogue researcher is flooding parts of the undercity to serve as aquariums for secret experiments. |
| 2 | Researchers are capturing members of the other guilds so they can create hybrid soldiers that take advantage of the weaknesses of those guilds. |
| 3 | Researchers team up to surround an entire neighborhood in a plasma casing that is slowly altering the environment and all its inhabitants. |
| 4 | A magic-wielding Simic hybrid is eluding capture by the authorities thanks to a combination of adaptations and spells. |
| 5 | A researcher delves too deep into ancient lore and discovers mind-warping alien secrets. |
| 6 | A researcher creates a moss that threatens to destroy much of the city's food production. |
| 7 | A **biomancer** seeks revenge by creating a specialized krasis that targets a specific guild. |
| 8 | A researcher turns to necromancy, exploring the combination of dead body parts with living tissue. |

![[107-427.png|right|300]]

#### Simic as Campaign Villains
Many Simic researchers are driven by the belief that the guild must adapt to the prospect of imminent war among the guilds. Thus, villains among their number are often those who seek to provoke the war they have foreseen, or those who go to extraordinary, unethical, or illegal lengths to conduct their work.

In the early stages of the campaign, the adventurers might face Simic-related threats such as rogue hybrids and rampaging krasis, which seem to be unrelated to each other and more or less accidental. As the campaign progresses, it becomes clear that these Simic creatures are part of a military build-up. The wrath of the other guilds turns toward the combine, but this conflict is exactly what the guild has been preparing for. Ultimately, it falls to the characters to either prevent the war, disable the Simic creatures that are poised to obliterate the other guilds' armies, or find another course of action that can maintain the balance of power in Ravnica.

### Simic Character Goals
The Simic Assignments table presents some ideas for missions that could drive an adventure or serve as side quests for a Simic character.

##### Simic Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Protect a Simic researcher who is trying to make an exhaustive examination of a new form of plant life. |
| 2 | Capture a previously unknown type of creature. |
| 3 | Contain an ooze or a krasis that is running loose. |
| 4 | Observe the behavior of a new form of krasis or Simic hybrid in the field. |
| 5 | Test a symbiotic magic item or life form (perhaps something like a living *cloak of the manta ray*). |
| 6 | Introduce a new predator species to the area to prey on a smaller species that is running amok. |

### Other Adventure Hooks
The Simic Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Simic Combine.

##### Simic Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A researcher who was hybridized with an ooze is accidentally spreading that effect throughout a neighborhood, partially liquefying the residents. |
| 2 | Multiple **category 3 krasis** under no one's control emerge from canals throughout the city. |
| 3 | A Simic laboratory has sunk to the bottom of a zonot, and all contact has been lost with the researchers inside. |
| 4 | A Simic airship falls to the ground, and it contains key research that several parties want to acquire. |
| 5 | A sage of the Gyre Clade accidentally creates an *antimagic field* that slowly spreads over the neighborhood. |
| 6 | People and animals near a Simic zonot develop spontaneous mutations. |

# Chapter 5: Treasures
![[116-501.jpg|right|300]]

Those who are bold or cunning enough can find treasures aplenty to reward their exploits in Ravnica. Coins change hands in back alleys, chests of riches are laden onto beasts of burden, and fine objects of art stand on display in museums and galleries. Obscene wealth lies secreted away in Orzhov vaults, the Azorius Senate's payroll is a bureaucratic tangle, and House Dimir greases countless palms with an apparently endless fortune. And items of magic lure adventurers and thieves with the promise of greater power.

## Coins in Treasure
When you use the treasure tables in *chapter 7* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, you can change the type of coinage found if you'd like to associate the coins with a particular guild. For more information about coinage in Ravnica, see the "*Currency: Zibs and Zinos*" section in this source's introduction.

**Copper pieces** encountered in treasure are either standard Azorius zibs or Orzhov alms-coins. A pouch of alms-coins might belong to someone who has been impoverished—or someone who makes a habit of robbing from the poor. A chest full of alms-coins could be an Orzhov lockbox used to hold the coins before they are distributed to the poor.

**Silver coins** minted by the Azorius Senate are worth 25 cp, so they might be found in smaller numbers than the standard silver pieces mentioned on the treasure tables. They are common currency, so they're found in the coin purses of virtually everyone in Ravnica. A hoard of silver coins might be amassed by a miser or stored in a bank vault (or stolen from such places).

**Electrum pieces** found in treasure are Azorius 50-zib coins. These coins are more common than electrum pieces are on most other D&D worlds, and they serve a function very similar to the silver 25-zib coins. You might reflect this fact by turning some silver pieces found as treasure into electrum pieces.

**Gold coins** in treasure translate directly to 1-zino coins, which could be the standard coins of Azorius mint or Boros coins (which might have been used as the weekly pay of a soldier in the Legion). A treasure might include Boros 5-zino coins, representing the salary of an officer or a payment made from the Legion to another guild.

**Platinum pieces** found in treasure are Orzhov 10-zino coins. They might have originally belonged to an Orzhov pontiff. Perhaps they were withdrawn from an account in an Orzhov bank—which suggests someone wealthy and powerful, possibly with criminal connections. A significant treasure find might include a stash of Orzhov 100-zino coins (one-tenth the number of platinum pieces found on the treasure table), which almost certainly belongs to a powerful Orzhov scion who wants it back.

## Guild Charms
![[117-502.png|right|300]]

A guild charm is a magical effect placed on an otherwise mundane item. Charms are often given to favored members of the guild—those whose renown scores with their guilds have reached 10 or higher—or those entrusted with important missions. A charm typically manifests as the guild's symbol emblazoned on an item that is worn or carried by the chosen creature.

A guild charm can be used only a certain number of times before it vanishes, and only by the creature upon which it was bestowed. If you use a charm to cast a spell, you can do so without expending a spell slot or providing any components. The spell's save DC is 15, its attack bonus is +7, and the spellcasting ability modifier for any spell effects is +4.

A charm can't be used in the area created by an *antimagic field* spell or a similar effect. The guildmaster of the charm's guild can revoke the charm as an action, but otherwise the charm can't be removed from the object on which it was placed by anything short of divine intervention or a *wish* spell.

The charms associated with each guild are described below.

- Azorius Charm
- Boros Charm
- Dimir Charm
- Golgari Charm
- Gruul Charm
- Izzet Charm
- Orzhov Charm
- Rakdos Charm
- Selesnya Charm
- Simic Charm

## Magic Items
Magic items are abundant on Ravnica. Izzet workshops and foundries create a plethora of wild and often dangerous items, and spellcasters from every guild craft items for their own use and that of their guild mates. More powerful items are created in grand experiments or by angelic blessings, or they find their way out of hidden vaults and ancient underground ruins.

### Guilds and Magic Items
Each of Ravnica's guilds has an affinity for certain magic items. This section identifies the magic items most likely to be created, used, or valued by each guild. The lists include the magic items in this source (referred to as *GGR*) and in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* (*DMG*) that are particularly appropriate for the guilds.

The guild lists are by no means comprehensive; the guilds are happy to use whatever resources become available to them, magical or otherwise. But the items shown here are particularly prized and even coveted by the guilds. Word of the discovery of a *holy avenger*, for example, can mobilize a whole Boros garrison to search for it and claim it for the legion's use. And if such an item is stolen from the Boros, the legion will go to equal lengths to reclaim it and punish the thieves.

Some items created on Ravnica are prized by all the guilds; they are listed on the General Items table.

##### General Items

Anything that enhances stealth or facilitates spying is precious to House Dimir. Agents of the guild disguise themselves, turn invisible, and shield their own minds while they pry into the minds of others.

##### Dimir Items
| Rarity | Item | Source |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| Uncommon | *Amulet of proof against detection and location* | *DMG* |

| Legendary | *Cloak of invisibility* | *DMG* |
| Legendary | *Ring of invisibility* | *DMG* |

#### Golgari Items
The members of the Golgari Swarm are scavengers who retrieve lost items from the undercity, which means that Golgari agents could conceivably end up in possession of any magic item of any origin. The items the Golgari prefer often involve stealth, insects, or poison.

##### Golgari Items
| Rarity | Item | Source |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| Common | *Moodmark paint* | *GGR* |
| Uncommon | *Boots of elvenkind* | *DMG* |

#### Gruul Items
The members of the Gruul Clans are as likely to destroy magic items as they are to use them, but certain weapons and strength-enhancing items are well suited to their tastes.

##### Gruul Items
| Rarity | Item | Source |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| Uncommon | *Gauntlets of ogre power* | *DMG* |

| Rare | *Stone of controlling earth elementals* | *DMG* |
| Legendary | *Ring of spell turning* | *DMG* |

#### Izzet Items
The Izzet League is the most prolific creator of magic items in Ravnica. Its inventions can be unpredictable and downright dangerous, but they can also be useful tools, weapons, and implements of magical manipulation. Izzet researchers are prone to giving their magic items special names, so what one person might call a *staff of thunder and lightning* might be an *electrosonic field manipulator* to its Izzet wielder.

##### Izzet Items
| Rarity | Item | Source |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| Uncommon | *Alchemy jug* | *DMG* |
| Uncommon | *Elemental gem* | *DMG* |

| Legendary | *Ring of elemental command* | *DMG* |
| Legendary | *Staff of the magi* | *DMG* |

#### Orzhov Items
The oligarchs and pontiffs of the Orzhov Syndicate view possession of magic items as a mark of status, whether those items are ostentatiously on display or hidden away in a vault. Items that the guild creates are often extremely ornate; Orzhov-made *wings of flying*, for example, might have the appearance of bird wings where every feather looks like colorful stained glass. Items that magically increase the wearer's imposing presence and authority are especially coveted in the syndicate.

##### Orzhov Items
| Rarity | Item | Source |

| Uncommon | *Eyes of charming* | *DMG* |

| Legendary | *Sphere of annihilation* | *DMG* |

#### Rakdos Items
Fire, pain, spectacle, and just enough random destruction to make life enjoyable—that's all **Rakdos** cultists want out of their magic items. Items that magically create fire, leave lingering wounds, instill fear, or randomly devour objects put inside them are all sources of delight for members of the Cult of **Rakdos**.

##### Rakdos Items
| Rarity | Item | Source |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| Uncommon | *Deck of illusions* | *DMG* |
| Uncommon | *Rakdos keyrune* | *GGR* |

| Legendary | *Iron flask* | *DMG* |
| Legendary | *Rakdos riteknife* | *GGR* |

#### Selesnya Items
Members of the Selesnya Conclave cherish magic items that heal and protect, items that call on the forces of nature (and the will of Mat'Selesnya), and weapons of fine elven elegance. Such items are often made from natural materials such as wood and leather and might incorporate leaves and vines.

##### Selesnya Items
| Rarity | Item | Source |
|:---:|---|:---:|

| Very rare | *Oathbow* | *DMG* |
| Very rare | *Staff of thunder and lightning* | *DMG* |
| Legendary | *Rod of resurrection* | *DMG* |

#### Simic Items
The Simic Combine spends more of its time altering the biological processes of living creatures than it does working on magic items. Its preferred items either facilitate physical transformation or are creatures themselves—symbiotic life forms engineered to provide Simic researchers and soldiers with new capabilities.

##### Simic Items

# Chapter 6: Friends and Foes
![[122-601.jpg|right|300]]

Ravnica is home to a great variety of creatures, including some that are unknown on other worlds in Dungeons & Dragons. This chapter provides stat blocks for many of these creatures, and it concludes with a collection of nonplayer characters who fill the ranks of Ravnica's guilds.

Some of the stat blocks in this source have a special feature: guild spells. If a stat block says its creature is a spellcaster of a particular guild—an Izzet spellcaster, for instance—that creature's spell list includes one or more spells from that guild's spell list. See *chapter 2* for the guilds' lists.

## Creatures by Guild
This section is a list of creatures in this chapter and in the *Monster Manual* that are associated with each guild. Each guild's entry includes a brief discussion of the monsters from the *Monster Manual* that could be found among the guild's members, and it includes a table showing monsters sorted by challenge rating.

Most of these monsters are in this source (*GGR*) or the *Monster Manual* (*MM*), but some of the monsters from *Volo's Guide to Monsters* (*VGM*) and *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes* (*MTF*) are also mentioned.

### Azorius Creatures
Most creatures associated with the Azorius Senate are humanoids (largely humans and vedalken) and various others that serve as familiars, pets, and mounts. Owls are popular familiars, since they are viewed as symbols of wisdom and sound judgment. Sphinxes and archons are the rare nonhumanoids that play a significant role in the leadership and operation of the guild.

Azorius lawmages craft one-eyed homunculi to perform menial tasks in Azorius buildings. These homunculi use the statistics of a regular homunculus except that they are wingless and have no flying speed.

#### Sphinxes of Judgment
Azorius sphinxes, known as sphinxes of judgment, wield hieromancy—the power of law magic—with the force of a judge's gavel to imprison criminals and compel truth from them. A **sphinx of judgment** is a gynosphinx, as described in the *Monster Manual*, but it is an Azorius spellcaster with the following wizard spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): *friends*, *mage hand*, *message*
- 1st level (4 slots): *command*, *ensnaring strike*, *shield*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *calm emotions*, *hold person*, *suggestion*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *clairvoyance*, *counterspell*, *dispel magic*
- 4th level (3 slots): *banishment*, *divination*
- 5th level (1 slot): *dominate person*

| 21 | **Isperia** | *GGR* |

### Boros Creatures
The Boros Legion employs many different creatures to swell the ranks of its soldiery. These creatures might serve as companions, guardians, or mounts.

#### Flame-Kin
Flame-kin (which use the azer stat block in the *Monster Manual*) are elemental soldiers magically created and animated to serve the legion as scouts and shock troops. Fanatical and inflexible, they are relics of a time when the guild was more concerned with zealotry than justice. They take the field for large military engagements.

| 21 | **Solar** | *MM* |
| 23 | **Aurelia** | *GGR* |

### Dimir Creatures
Alongside human and vampire spies and assassins, a variety of stealthy and shadowy monsters contribute to the work of House Dimir. Doppelgangers and invisible stalkers move unseen among the populace. Horrors—as well as gricks, intellect devourers, and similar monsters—are thought to be the fears of Ravnica's populace given form by Dimir magic. And undead such as shadows, wraiths, and Nightveil specters keep watch over secret Dimir territories.

| 17 | **Lazav** | *GGR* |

### Golgari Creatures
The Devkarin elves (drow), deadly medusas, and insectile kraul are the three most important power groups among the Golgari Swarm, vying for control over a teeming horde of lesser (or at least less ambitious) creatures.

#### Erstwhile
A significant shift in the Golgari balance of power began when the kraul death priest Mazirek discovered an ancient mausoleum compound. Deep in the undercity, beneath the layers of civilization that had built up over millennia, Mazirek found a hidden network of vaults called Umerilek, an enormous structure that would have dominated a city block. Inside were hundreds of well-preserved corpses suffused with a latent necromantic power that Mazirek activated, bringing the corpses back to a shambling semblance of life. This new race of undead is called the Erstwhile (equivalent to the wight in the *Monster Manual*).

In their time, the Erstwhile were aristocratic elves of immense wealth and opulence. They still wear their stately attire, despite its moldering condition, and they lend an air of high culture to the undercity court of the Golgari.

#### Fungus
Golgari territory is filled with creatures composed of fungus and detritus from the guild's rot farms. Shriekers serve as sentries in Golgari tunnels, and violet fungus sprouts from the corpses of intruders. Amorphous masses of dead and decaying matter can develop into shambling mounds in the spore-saturated environment of the undercity.

Some Golgari creatures are symbiotic fusions of fungus and living creatures. Golgari trolls are hulking sewer dwellers with fungus adorning their bodies like manes, acting as extra layers for their already tough hide and facilitating their regeneration.

#### Insects and Arachnids
Beetles, centipedes, spiders, and countless other insects and arachnids infest Golgari warrens. These creatures, often associated with decay and rebirth, are prized by the guild. Giant bugs serve as beasts of burden, companions, steeds, and guardians. Among the largest of these is the Deadbridge goliath beetle (equivalent to the triceratops in the *Monster Manual*).

Piranha beetles (best represented as a **swarm of insects**, from the *Monster Manual*) burrow through the soft earth and gather into swarms to overtake their victims and strip the flesh from them. Skein spiders (as giant spiders, from the *Monster Manual*) are an important part of Golgari reclamation work: fungus grows rapidly along the silken spiderwebs, expanding to engulf architecture and hasten the Golgari annexation process.

#### Zombies
The guild encourages the use and exploration of necromancy. Fungus covers the bodies of most of the undead that serve the guild, the majority of which are fungus drudges (equivalent to zombies in the *Monster Manual*)—mindless servants animated by the fungus that infests their bodies.

### Gruul Creatures
Many dangerous creatures haunt the rubblebelts and other places the Gruul Clans inhabit.

#### Beasts
Gruul territory is full of beasts of all sizes. Herds of giant boars (see the *Monster Manual*) called batterboars roam the rubblebelts; each batterboar can grow to be the size of a mammoth (as in the *Monster Manual*), and the passage of a herd can shake the ground and topple buildings. Maaka (use the saber-toothed tiger stat block from the *Monster Manual*) are territorial cats, about 15 feet long, with six eyes. They typically keep to the rubblebelts, though from time to time they are spotted amid tended groves and gardens.

Any beast described in this source or in the *Monster Manual* can roam the rubblebelts. The Gruul can bring out the fury in these beasts, turning them into ragebeasts. Ragebeasts often have the Reckless and Siege Monster traits:

***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the ragebeast can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

***Siege Monster.*** The ragebeast deals double damage to objects and structures.

#### Elementals
Gruul shamans channel primal energies to summon raging fire elementals that blaze ahead of marauding Gruul bands. Or they transform the rubble and detritus of civilization into earth elementals, twisted through with choking vines, that literally give new life to the ruin of the city. These elementals are intensely destructive, but they last only as long as the magic used to summon them persists.

#### Giants
Nearly all the Gruul Clans include hill giants, stone giants, cyclopes, ogres, ettins, and fomorians among their number, and one clan—the Bolrac clan—is composed entirely of such brutes.

#### Hydras
Once a hydra chooses a lair and declares the surrounding land its territory, it's almost impossible to drive the creature out. The Gruul revere these multiheaded predators as vestiges of the ancient times before the guilds took over the world. They don't kill hydras for trophies, but pulling a spine from a hydra's neck is a mark of great bravery among the Gruul.

### Izzet Creatures
Izzet laboratories are staffed with attendants (commoners) and chemisters (mages). Pixies and sprites (called ratchet faeries) find employment among the Izzet working on projects that are too small for other races.

The Izzet League employs elementals formed from the combination of two or more elemental forces, including mephits of the smoke, steam, ice, and magma varieties.

### Orzhov Creatures
The Orzhov Syndicate attracts and entraps beings of all kinds, from lowly bats and manufactured thrulls to brutal giants and exalted angels. Orzhov gargoyles, animated by magic that manifests as a green, smoky glow in their eyes and gaping mouths, keep watch over banks and basilicas, and bloodthirsty vampires lurk in the vaults and crypts below.

### Rakdos Creatures
All sorts of savage, howling beasts accompany **Rakdos** cultists. Hell hounds, nightmares, and magmins might perform alongside the other entertainers or accompany notable members of the cult as guardians and companions. **Rakdos** giants, along with ogres draped in hooked chains and spikes, carry and set up tents and stages—and cause utter mayhem when blood lust seizes them.

### Selesnya Creatures
The Selesnya Conclave uses its close connection to nature to enlist a variety of creatures to its cause. These supporters of the conclave take their rightful place in the natural order alongside its more humanlike members.

#### Elementals
Elementals rise to the guild's defense when the Selesnya Conclave is drawn into conflict. Most of these elementals are made from the roots and branches of trees, making them equivalent to awakened shrubs or awakened trees. Earth elementals incorporate building materials in their forms to serve as armor and weapons.

#### Plant Creatures
Many Selesnya buildings, temples, and paths are protected by treants or carnivorous plants, including blights and shambling mounds. Some have vine-like arms that ensnare prey and drop it into pitcher-like bodies filled with acid. Others are covered with sticky glue that immobilizes and slowly digests the hapless victim.

#### Pegasi
Most often found carrying equenauts in battle, pegasi are ready allies who share the guild's goals and virtues. Members of the guild raise them from infancy, carefully protecting the foals from griffons, drakes, and other aerial predators.

### Simic Creatures
Simic scientists are interested in the ways that all life forms adapt to their changing environments, but they have a particular fascination with the largest creatures. In a world covered with urban construction, most of these creatures soar above the city or glide deep below it in subterranean oceans accessible only through the Simic zonots.

#### Benthids
Simic scientists use the term "benthid" to refer to the leviathans of the deep. These creatures vary greatly in size and morphology, so they might be represented by the statistics for a giant octopus, plesiosaurus, killer whale, giant shark, dragon turtle, or kraken.

#### Merfolk
Ravnica's merfolk are unique to the Simic. They emerged from the depths of the plane's long-buried oceans less than a century ago and immediately took on leadership positions in the guild. They claim a deep connection to Ravnica's primal oceans, which are almost untouched by civilization. They have the statistics of the merfolk in the *Monster Manual*, except that they speak Common and Merfolk, and their legs give them a walking speed of 30 feet.

### Guildless Creatures
A monster that doesn't appear on the tables in this section can show up in Ravnica. Other categories of creatures that exist in the world include the following:

**Undercity Denizens**. Creatures that don't have clear guild connections, such as carrion crawlers and otyughs, creep and slink through the undercity.

**Undead**. Orzhov spirits and Golgari zombies are not the extent of undead in Ravnica. Wherever people die, there's a chance of them returning as revenants, ghosts, or other forms of undead.

**The Guildless**. The nonplayer characters presented in the *Monster Manual* and other sources can represent any of the ordinary citizens of Ravnica, whether they are connected to guilds or not. Commoners go about their daily business, bandits prey on the weak, and cultists lurk in shadowed shrines, either hidden from the guilds or beneath their notice.

**Ordinary Animals**. Virtually any of the creatures that appear in appendix A of the *Monster Manual* could show up in Ravnica. Many such creatures are confined to small greenbelts or the ruined rubblebelts, but others thrive in the urban environment, including birds, scavengers, and sewer dwellers.

#### Drakes
![[124-603.png|right|300]]

The winged reptiles known as drakes are a common sight in the skies of Ravnica. They soar above the spires and rooftops hunting for aerial prey. Highly trainable, they are favored as pets, servants, and mounts.

The most common drakes, called wind drakes, are about the size of a human and use the statistics of a **pteranodon**. The smallest drakes are the size of a bird of prey and use the statistics of an **eagle**; larger ones have the statistics of a **giant eagle**.

#### Pack Beasts
You can use stat blocks from the *Monster Manual* to represent various pack beasts encountered in Ravnica, as indicated in the Pack Beasts table.

***Brushstrider.*** Destructive when confined, brushstriders thrive when they can freely wander garden areas.

***Ceratok.*** A ceratok has two curving horns at the end of its snout.

***Dromad.*** A dromad is similar to a camel, but it lacks a hump.

***Indrik.*** With their long necks, indriks are common sights in the Tenth District. They are ornery creatures; an indrik without a handler to order it around usually goes on a rampage or flees.

***Krovod.*** A krovod is a slow-witted, ox-like animal.

***Raktusk.*** A raktusk is a bison-like creature, about 10 feet tall at the shoulder.

##### Pack Beasts
| Beast | Monster Manual Stat Block |
| Brushstrider | **Elk** |
| Ceratok | **Rhinoceros** |
| Dromad | **Camel** |
| Indrik | **Elephant** |
| Krovod | **Mammoth** |
| Raktusk | **Giant elk** |

# NPCs by Guild
This section describes various nonplayer characters that belong to each guild. These characters can serve as enemies, rivals, allies, or contacts. In addition to the NPCs presented here, you can customize the NPCs in the *Monster Manual* and other sources to make them feel like part of a particular guild.

Also included in this chapter are statistics and descriptions of the guildmasters of Ravnica. Without exception, these are powerful creatures. In most campaigns, the guildmasters will come into play more often in negotiations and other social settings than in combat. Thus, each guildmaster's ideals, bonds, and flaws are included. As a general rule, a guildmaster's personal agenda is in line with the guild's goals described in *chapter 2*, so the guild entries there provide additional direction for roleplaying these individuals.

Several other named guild members are highlighted in sidebars.

### Soldier
Soldiers are found in many of Ravnica's guilds. The soldier stat block represents a typical member of the rank and file, though weaponry and armor can vary.

## Azorius NPCs
The Azorius Senate's activities focus on maintaining public order. For example, the Lyev Column acts as the police force for all of Ravnica. The Azorius NPCs table summarizes key roles within this force. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

##### Azorius NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Arrester | **Knight** or **veteran** |
| Azorius soldier | **Soldier*** |
| Hussar (cavalry) | **Soldier*** mounted on a **warhorse** or a **griffon** |
| Magical support | **Lawmage*** or **precognitive mage*** |
* Appears in this chapter

> ##### Lavinia, Steward of the Guildpact
>Arrester Lavinia, an Azorius arrester (use the **veteran** stat block in the *Monster Manual*), is straightforward and stern. To her, justice is a bird you have to catch, not a dog that willingly walks toward its master. She worked alongside Jace, the Living Guildpact, scheduling appointments and relaying messages. The work was beneath her, but Lavinia's allegiance was to the soul of her city. Jace's disappearance worries her, but she has steadfastly refused to violate the law of the land by stepping into his duties.
>

### Supreme Judge Isperia
**Isperia** is the current guildmaster of the Azorius Senate. As a sphinx, she is aloof and values solitude above all. However, she has been forced to give up her privacy to deal with the increased crime and chaos on Ravnica.

**Isperia** is devoted to her guild's belief that law is the ultimate bulwark against chaos, and it is her steady hand that guides the Azorius through these uncertain times. As guildmaster, **Isperia** serves as the supreme judge, a role that takes advantage of her encyclopedic knowledge of Ravnica's labyrinthine legal system.

If an encounter turns violent, **Isperia** refrains from using lethal force if possible, preferring to subdue a wrongdoing so that the legal system can mete out justice.

#### Isperia's Traits

>**Ideal**: "The law provides direction for every arena of life; it is the only compass I need."
>
>**Bond**: "I can't stand by and watch disorder spread through the city. Without the Azorius, Ravnica would collapse. In the absence of order, we must establish it."
>
>**Flaw**: "If Ravnica didn't need me, I would prefer to live a life of solitude and contemplation."
>

![[125-636755109153147792.png|right|300]]

### Lawmage
The Azorius Senate has spellcasters who are trained to capture lawbreakers and bring them to justice. A lawmage's magic is focused on restraining criminals and on protecting bystanders from becoming casualties when arresters are pursuing malefactors. A significant proportion of the guild's vedalken are lawmages.

### Precognitive Mage
Precognitive mages, a rarity among Azorius spellcasters, are capable of capturing glimpses of the future. They are typically employed to anticipate the actions of wanted criminals, thus aiding in their capture.

> ##### Geetra
>Geetra is a precognitive mage who first put her gifts to use as a young thief on the streets of Ravnica. While still a teenager, she was apprehended and then pardoned in exchange for agreeing to use her talents in the service of the Azorius Senate. For decades, she worked in almost complete anonymity, her gifts unappreciated. But with the senate displaying an increased interest in the talents of precognitive mages, Geetra has been given a more prominent position, which she has embraced with enthusiasm. She worries about the impact that her guild has on the rest of Ravnica but believes in her heart that she is helping the people. Chaos can only destroy, and her visions are a tool to ensure that society can live in safety in all variants of the future.

## Boros NPCs
The Boros Legion attracts those who believe justice is the highest ideal and that it's worth fighting for on behalf of all Ravnica's citizens. From its angelic commanders down to its raw recruits, everyone in the legion wages war against corruption, exploitation, and lawlessness.

The Boros Legion has its own soldiers, and the elite Sunhome Guard protects the legion's headquarters. The Boros NPCs table summarizes key roles within these forces. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

##### Boros NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Boros soldier | **Soldier*** |
| Magical support | **Firefist*** or **frontline medic*** |
| Shock trooper | **Reckoner*** |
| Skyknight | **Knight** mounted on a **Skyjek roc*** |
| Sunhome Guard | **Guardian giant*** or **veteran** |
* Appears in this chapter

### Warleader Aurelia
The angel **Aurelia** leads the Boros Legion. During the years of her leadership, she has shown a strong appreciation for the ordinary citizens who are often caught in the middle of interguild violence.

True justice, **Aurelia** argues, isn't merely the enforcement of the letter of existing laws (let the Azorius fret over that), but the establishment of equitable and compassionate relationships among all of Ravnica's people. That means protecting the weak from the depredations of the strong, sheltering the innocents who are threatened by war, and ensuring that enforcement of the law doesn't become oppressive. **Aurelia** actively supports efforts to establish a lasting peace among the guilds in the absence of the Guildpact.

**Aurelia** prefers to lead the Boros Legion from the front. She brings swift and unrelenting punishment to the wicked, and her temper is legendary.

Immortal Nature. **Aurelia** doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

#### Aurelia's Traits

>**Ideal**: "Justice. We must do whatever it takes to establish fair and merciful relationships among Ravnica's people—through force of arms when necessary."
>
>**Bond**: "The entire legion obeys my commands, and I am therefore beholden to every one of my soldiers."
>
>**Flaw**: "I charge into battle with little heed for my own wellbeing."
>

![[127-636755111679113628.png|right|300]]

### Firefist
Boros firefists combine potent magic with peerless fighting ability, inspiring all who serve alongside them. They often act as the point of contact between the Boros Legion and the angelic leaders.

![[128-636755111977048218.png|right|300]]

### Frontline Medic
The soldiers of the Boros Legion depend on skilled healers to keep them on their feet. Frontline medics use a mix of magical healing and mundane medicine to keep their compatriots alive.

### Reckoner
Boros reckoners combine physical power and magical prowess, serving as the shock troops of the legion. They are adept at breaking up mobs and organized lines of defense. Sometimes described as living thunderstorms, reckoners charge their bodies with lightning that bursts forth in their spells and lashes out at enemies who harm them. Many reckoners are minotaurs.

![[129-636755112571289881.png|right|300]]

## Dimir NPCs
The Dimir are a collection of individual agents and secretive cells woven subtly throughout the fabric of Ravnica and across all the guilds. Dimir agents excel at information gathering, covert operations, and assassination. They collect secrets, relay intelligence, and sow discord—all in obedience to the sometimes cryptic orders of their mysterious leaders.

The Dimir NPCs table summarizes key roles within House Dimir. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

##### Dimir NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Dimir spy | **Spy** or **thought spy*** |
| Duskmantle assassin | **Assassin** |
| Mind mage | **Mind mage*** |
* Appears in this chapter

### Lazav the Faceless
**Lazav** is uniquely qualified to be the Dimir guildmaster: he is a shapechanger whose mysterious genius is informed by agents from the entire Dimir network. He takes on a tremendous variety of guises as his needs and plans require. He might step out into the Ravnican streets as an elderly widow to eavesdrop at the bazaar, become a vedalken hussar of the Azorius Senate to sidestep a checkpoint, or transform into a Tin Street merchant to deceive a passing noble. His true form might be that of a doppelganger or some other creature; no one has ever seen it.

#### Lazav's Traits

>**Ideal**: "Knowledge. To know a thing is to have power over it."
>
>**Bond**: "When the time is right and my plans have come to fruition, all of Ravnica will be mine."
>
>**Flaw**: "I can't trust anyone."
>

![[130-636755112924118365.png|right|300]]

### Mind Mage
Dimir mind mages are among the most feared spellcasters in Ravnica, thanks in large part to the aura of mystery that shrouds them and their work. Their ability to read and alter memories commands respect from the other members of House Dimir and makes them useful in the full spectrum of the guild's activities. Many mind mages lead cells of their own.

### Thought Spy
Thought spies form the backbone of House Dimir's covert operations. They are trained in stealth and infiltration, tactics that they supplement with rigorously developed mental abilities. To ensure that no secrets slip through Dimir's fingers, they infiltrate rival guilds. In addition to traditional means of gathering intelligence, thought spies use their magic to spy on the thoughts of their targets.

## Golgari NPCs
In its embrace of death and its claim over fetid, rotting environments, the Golgari Swarm appeals to those who are comfortable in a world of fungus, rot, and monsters.

Every member of the Golgari Swarm has a function, working together like the parts of a single, larger organism. At the same time, internal factions vie for authority. The most prominent faction is the Devkarin elves, whose spiritual leader, Izoni, is no friend of the guildmaster, Jarad. The medusas are still struggling to coalesce as a faction. The kraul are slowly gaining more influence in the guild under the leadership of the death priest, Mazirek. These faction leaders can serve as patrons for Golgari characters. They might send characters on missions to interfere with a rival or to increase the power and influence of their own faction. They can also serve as major adversaries for adventurers who oppose the Golgari Swarm.

Golgari NPCs include reclaimers, who scavenge and recycle corpses and other detritus, and assassins, who belong to a secret society called the Ochran. The Golgari NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

##### Golgari NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Devkarin warrior | **Drow** or **drow elite warrior** |
| Ochran assassin | **Assassin** |
| Reclaimer | **Scout** |
| Spiritual leader | **Golgari shaman*** |
* Appears in this chapter

> ##### Izoni, Devkarin Matka
>The spiritual leader of the Devkarin elves holds the position of matka. Izoni, a Golgari shaman, has recently risen to her position after the suspicious death of her predecessor, Zdenia. Izoni is known for her ability to control insects and spiders, and she is never encountered without the company of one or more swarms of insects crawling over and around her. When she walks, she appears to glide over the ground.
>

### Jarad Vod Savo
The Golgari guildmaster is a Devkarin necromancer and lich named **Jarad Vod Savo**. In life, Jarad was an archer and accomplished hunter, as well as the brother of the previous guildmaster, the ambitious Savra. Jarad mastered the ways of necromancy so he could rise as a lich after he sacrificed himself to save his son from the demon **Rakdos**.

As head of the Golgari Swarm, Jarad commands elf and medusa assassins, legions of kraul, brutish trolls, and masses of undercity-dwelling creatures. Thanks to the necromantic power he wields—and with the support of his loyal guards and soldiers—he has survived a number of assassination attempts from various upstarts.

Undead Nature. Jarad doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### Jarad's Traits

>**Ideal**: "Death. There's wisdom to be gained in it, whether it be your own or someone else's."
>
>**Bond**: "Ravnica, with all its structures and institutions, will eventually rot away, and it will be time for the Golgari to bloom from the carcass."
>
>**Flaw**: "I am beyond life and death and can't be harmed."
>

### Golgari Shaman
Golgari shamans are the spiritual leaders of the Golgari Swarm. They teach the guild's beliefs about the cycles of nature, using their necromantic magic to show how life sprouts from death.

Golgari shamans paint their faces so they appear to have extra eyes on their cheeks and chins. They sometimes use magical *moodmark paint* to allow them to communicate by means of these marks. They wear clothing adorned with beetle carapaces, spiderwebs, or shelf fungus.

### Golgari Lairs
Members of the Golgari Swarm have an intimate connection to their territory. When at least six Golgari defend their territory together, they can call on the environment to aid them. The group must include **Jarad Vod Savo** or at least one Golgari shaman, kraul death priest, undercity medusa, or Devkarin lich. When determining the difficulty of such an encounter, consider the lair to be one additional creature of challenge rating 1.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Golgari group takes a lair action, causing one of the following effects; the Golgari can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- If the Golgari can see any sewer openings, they can cause sewage to overflow. Any creature within 20 feet of such an opening must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed up to 20 feet in a straight line away from the opening.
- Spore-laden fungi release a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the Golgari choose within 120 feet of any member of the group. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until one of the Golgari dismisses it as an action, the Golgari group uses this lair action again, or all the members of the Golgari group die. The area within the cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) poison damage.
- Tendrils of creeping fungi reach out to ensnare the enemies of the Golgari. The Golgari choose a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 60 feet of any member of the group. Each creature in the area that isn't allied with the Golgari group must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until the Golgari group uses this lair action again, all the members of the group are slain, or no member of the group is within 60 feet of the effect. A creature restrained in this way can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the restrained effect on itself with a success.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a Golgari lair is infested with mosses and strange fungi. This habitat accounts for one or both of the following effects in the surrounding undercity (the effects don't spread to the surface):

- Moss, fungi, and other growth covers every underground surface within half a mile of the lair.
- Fungal spores drifting throughout the lair have the power to animate corpses. Whenever a Small or Medium humanoid dies within the lair, roll a die. On an odd number, the dead creature rises up as a fungus drudge (use the zombie stat block in the *Monster Manual*) 1d8 hours later, unless its body is destroyed.

If all the Golgari in the lair die, the regional effects fade over 1d10 days.

## Gruul NPCs
Like the creatures that fight alongside them, warriors and shamans of the Gruul Clans are wildly aggressive.

True to their name, the Gruul Clans include a number of different groups with their own leaders and traditions. Beyond the six most prominent clans (the Burning Tree, the Ghor, the Scab, the Slizt, the Gravel Hide, the Zhur-Taa, and the Bolrac), countless small clans—some little more than war bands—claim territories throughout the rubblebelts.

Gruul NPCs fill various clan roles. The Gruul NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

##### Gruul NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Clan member | **Anarch*** |
| Clan warrior | **Berserker** |
| Druid | **Druid of the Old Ways*** |
| Scout | **Rubblebelt stalker*** |
| Trog (Gruul hermit) | **Gladiator** |
* Appears in this chapter

### Borborygmos
For decades, the enormous cyclops **Borborygmos** has commanded the respect and obedience of the Gruul Clans by defeating all who challenged him. He embodies the raging fire that the Gruul believe burns in their bellies, and his wrath toward the civilization of Ravnica knows no bounds.

Mightiest of the Mighty. **Borborygmos** leads the Burning Tree clan, which is the largest and most diverse of the Gruul Clans. He is almost always accompanied by other members of his clan—not because he needs their protection, but because they might need his. His companions include creatures ranging from burly giants to cowering goblins.

The Gruul follow strength, and **Borborygmos** holds his position only because he has proved stronger than any challenger.

![[133-636755114197519042.png|right|300]]

#### Borborygmos's Traits

>**Ideal**: "We fight!"
>
>**Bond**: "I will bring the wilds back."
>
>**Flaw**: "I don't have to listen to anybody."
>

### Anarch
The rank-and-file members of the Gruul Clans, called anarchs, despise civilization and have sworn to tear down both its physical structures and its institutions.

Anarchs scavenge everything, from the hide armor they wear to the weapons they wield. As they pick through the refuse of the rubblebelts, they sometimes come across magic items and other valuable treasures.

![[134-636755114842750008.png|right|300]]

### Druid of the Old Ways
The druids of the Old Ways are the keepers of ancient Gruul traditions devoted to the primal ferocity of animal gods such as Ilharg the Raze-Boar and Kashath the Stalker.

The End-Raze. The druids of the Old Ways believe that civilization will never be eradicated by scattered raids and petty skirmishes. They cling to the idea of a coming apocalypse, the End-Raze, when Ilharg's hoofs will trample every brick and stone of Ravnica's soaring skylines to rubble. The world will return to a state of nature in which the lawless code of muscle and savagery will reign once again.

> ##### Nikya of the Old Ways
>The Zhur-Taa leader, Nikya, is a powerful centaur druid of the Old Ways. In fact, she considers herself to be the last of the true Gruul druids. Though raised to be a warrior, Nikya soon discovered her natural gifts with magic. She can summon enormous constricting vines from the ancient layers of Ravnica's crust. She has little love for **Borborygmos**, and she believes that another leader—one who is loyal to the Old Ways—will arise among the Gruul before the End-Raze begins.
>

![[135-636755115264247397.png|right|300]]

### Rubblebelt Stalker
Rubblebelt stalkers are scouts and skirmishers for the Gruul Clans. They excel at moving over challenging terrain, whether they're picking their way through treacherous ruins or clambering across rooftops. They favor ambush tactics and avoid confrontations with stronger forces, relying on their superior mobility to make their escape.

## Izzet NPCs
Though the Izzet League officially serves the function of maintaining the city's public works, most of its members join the guild to indulge their insatiable curiosity for magical knowledge. Using the guild's extensive resources and sturdy facilities, researchers pursue their studies through reckless experimentation, which often ends in destruction of property, loss of limb, or at the very least, a loud boom. Nearly all Izzet members have some capability with magic.

Izzet NPCs include chemisters, who work extensively with the magic alloy mizzium, and their attendants. The Izzet NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

##### Izzet NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Attendant | **Commoner** |
| Chemister | **Mage** |
| Guard | **Scorchbringer guard*** |
| Magic tester | **Flux blastseeker**,* **cosmotronic blastseeker**,* **counterflux blastseeker**,* or **galvanic blastseeker*** |
* Appears in this chapter

> ##### Master Chemister Grozgrox
>Master Chemister Grozgrox is a viashino (lizardfolk) mage with a talent for shaping mizzium. His genius has earned commendations from **Niv-Mizzet** himself on two separate occasions, a fact that Grozgrox tries to work into conversation as often as possible.
>

### Niv-Mizzet
Possessed of arrogance and vanity that matches his vast intellect and tremendous power, **Niv-Mizzet** is the ancient dragon who founded and continues to control the Izzet League. From his private laboratory at the top of the Izzet guildhall, **Niv-Mizzet** directs the research and experiments of his countless underlings. He coordinates a tremendous number of apparently unrelated projects, working toward some mysterious end.

There can be little doubt that this ancient dragon is one of the most intelligent beings on Ravnica and one of the world's most powerful spellcasters. He is just as acquisitive as any dragon, but his treasure is scientific and magical knowledge. His ambition is a looming threat in the minds of all the other guildmasters, but confronting him directly is almost unthinkable thanks to the combination of his awesome magical power and the sheer physical threat of a fire-breathing, sword-toothed dragon.

![[136-636755115845494246.png|right|300]]

#### Niv-Mizzet's Traits

>**Ideal**: "Innovation. Don't just have an idea—have all of them."
>
>**Bond**: "I have spent more than ten thousand years researching the mysteries of the world around me, but there is much more to discover."
>
>**Flaw**: "I find it tedious to converse with simpletons who lack vision."
>

### Blastseekers
While chemisters focus on inventing new tools, weapons, and other devices for the guild to use, the role of a blastseeker is to put those devices to work. Despite the name, not all such devices produce explosions, but all the most interesting ones (from the Izzet perspective) do.

![[137-636755116506140962.png|right|300]]

> ##### Mizzix of the Izmagnus
>Mizzix is a goblin galvanic blastseeker who began her Izzet career as a lowly attendant. But she quickly earned her a place at her own magical forge with a squadron of attendants. Through a combination of natural talent, calculated political moves, and fortunate accidents, Mizzix has now risen to the highest position in the Izzet League's court, occupying a seat of the Izmagnus.

## Orzhov NPCs
Every person in the Orzhov Syndicate, living or dead, has a place in the guild's rigid hierarchy. From the undead spirits that make up the ruling Obzedat to the lowly undead borrower spirits at the bottom, along with the ranks of the living in between, everyone knows where they stand: who is above them, who is below them, who owes them, and whom they owe.

The Orzhov hierarchy includes advokists who find loopholes in the law to exploit, knights who enforce the guild's will, and indentured spirits. The Orzhov NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

##### Orzhov NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Advokist | **Mage** |
| Indentured spirit | **Indentured spirit*** |
| Knight | **Knight** |
| Oligarch | **Noble** |
| Pontiff or ministrant | **Priest** or **acolyte** |
* Appears in this chapter

### Obzedat, the Ghost Council
The ghosts who make up the Obzedat are traditionally called patriarchs, though they can be male or female. They are the oldest, wealthiest, and most influential oligarchs of the Orzhov Syndicate. They have been dead for centuries, but they refuse to let go of the fortunes they amassed in life. Addicted to power and prestige, these patriarchs continue to dominate the guild and accumulate even larger fortunes.

Mostly Unanimous. The ghosts of the Obzedat function as a unit, driven by their shared desire to accumulate ever more wealth for the guild. In times of disagreement, the eldest of the council exerts his seniority to bend the council to his will.

Grandfather Karlov. The head of the council, who gives final approval to its decisions and breaks ties within the group, is Karlov, known as Grandfather. In life, Karlov was the greediest of Orzhov oligarchs, and his many centuries as a spirit have not diminished his hunger for more wealth.

Undead Nature. An Obzedat ghost doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

#### The Ghost Council's Traits

>**Ideal**: "Influence is measured in power, status, and money, but mostly money."
>
>**Bond**: "Gather as much as you can while you can, for when you die, you will take it with you."
>
>**Flaw**: "Everyone has a price."
>

![[139-636755117769707664.png|right|300]]

> ##### Teysa Karlov
>Under the authority of the Obzedat, Teysa Karlov (a mage with access to Orzhov guild spells) formerly held the title of grand envoy, serving as the representative of the Orzhov when interaction with the leadership of other guilds was necessary. A defining characteristic of the Orzhov for decades was the tension between Teysa, living in the complex political realities of the world, and the inflexible, avaricious Obzedat. Teysa argued strenuously that the Obzedat's isolationism and their reluctance to forge alliances that could make them reliant on other guilds would lead to the syndicate's downfall. That tension reached its boiling point when Teysa enlisted the help of Tajic, Blade of the Boros Legion, in an attempt to seize power from the Obzedat. Her attempt failed, and the Obzedat imprisoned Teysa, eliminated the role of grand envoy, and canceled all dealings with other guilds. Teysa remains in prison to this day, and the Ghost Council extorts corrupt officials to make sure they keep her locked away.

## Rakdos NPCs
The Cult of **Rakdos** attracts thrill seekers. Some of its members are lured by promises of hedonistic pleasure; others are drawn like moths to the spectacle of the fiery stage. They come to join a twisted community where no impulse is unacceptable, no act is too vile, and all that matters is the excitement and pleasure of the moment. They come for a chance at the spotlight—some slim hope of fame, even if it is the infamy of going down in flames. And they come for fellowship, an easy companionship without the earnest spirituality of the Selesnya, the regimented discipline of the Boros, or the hierarchy of the Orzhov.

Not every member of the guild is a performer; some members simply tag along to witness the guild's mayhem. The **Rakdos** NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

##### Rakdos NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Blood witch | **Blood witch*** |
| Cult member | **Cult fanatic** or **cultist** |
| Performer | **Rakdos lampooner*** or **Rakdos** performer (**blade juggler**, **fire eater**, or **high-wire acrobat**)* |
* Appears in this chapter

### Rakdos
**Rakdos**, the demon for whom his cult is named, embodies hedonism. He is also the consummate entertainer, whose mere appearance is an act of grisly performance art. A monstrous figure standing thirty feet tall, spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging a flaming scythe, **Rakdos** demands the spotlight. His every entrance is a showstopper.

Sometimes after his grand entrance, **Rakdos** crouches to witness the performances of those who adore him. To them, his opinion is the only one that matters, but he is a demanding spectator. He has seen thousands of years of circus tricks and has no patience for performers who don't give their all. His flaming scythe has brought more than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close.

Jaded as he is, **Rakdos** attends his cult's performances only rarely. He often retreats into his lair below the cult's guildhall for months or years at a time, but his followers know that he might emerge at any time to witness the latest spectacle.

#### Rakdos's Traits

>**Ideal**: "Everyone should pursue their greatest desire."
>
>**Bond**: "If you want my favor, show me a performance I've never seen before."
>
>**Flaw**: "What is joy?"
>

![[141-636755118302640621.png|right|300]]

### Blood Witch
Blood witches imagine themselves to be the intermediaries between **Rakdos** and his cult—the pinnacle of his priesthood, his trusted advisors, and the messengers who communicate his will to the scattered troupes and ringmasters. The Cult of **Rakdos** recognizes no authority but **Rakdos**, and the demon lord requires no advisors. Nonetheless, the blood witches are smart, charismatic, and powerful, so their voices do carry some weight.

Blood witches strive both to protect the cult from external interference and to punish those who bring harm to the guild. They claim grandiose titles, such as Tormentor of the Wojek, as a way of mocking their intended victims.

![[142-636755118642849901.png|right|300]]

### Rakdos Lampooner
One of the most effective weapons in the **Rakdos** cult's arsenal is satire, and a **Rakdos** lampooner is a virtuoso of that art. Lampooners generally reserve their mockery for people and guilds that have seized an outsized measure of power, those who need to be taken down a peg, rather than piling further humiliation onto those who are already struggling. They use masks, marionettes, or effigies to caricature public figures, or sometimes play pranks on those individuals directly in the streets.

![[143-636755119018939359.png|right|300]]

### Rakdos Performer
By offering a place for those of many different talents, the Cult of **Rakdos** has seen its numbers swell with performing artists, including blade jugglers, fire eaters, and high wire acrobats. Performers carry the message of **Rakdos** out into the streets: cut loose, free yourself from the bonds of society's mores and expectations, and indulge your desires.

![[144-636755119404834344.png|right|300]]

> ##### Judith, the Scourge Diva
>Judith appears at **Rakdos** clubs and street shows as a singer and performance artist, combining dark soliloquies and bizarre pain stunts. She's the grand dame of the **Rakdos**, and what she says backstage goes. Judith covets the adoration heaped on **Rakdos** by his cultists. She does countless performances a week, but the big demon gets all the praise. She has begun to assemble a small entourage of fans, toadies, and understudies who echo her complaints about the guild's leader.
>

![[145-607.png|right|300]]

### Rakdos Carnival
As lumbering giants put up makeshift stages and cackling devils ignite the footlights, the first performers begin to gather the crowds. Exuberant music with erratic rhythms draws spectators from the surrounding neighborhood, and cheers of approval greet the more accomplished performers—along with gasps and shrieks as the acts get more risky and the first blood is drawn. Acrobats cavort through the streets while sword swallowers and knife throwers flash bright steel. The crowd gets larger and wilder, the shouts and screams get louder, the fires burn brighter, and blood glistens red in the torchlight. The spectacle is gruesome but captivating; the crowd hates to watch but can't look away. Soon madness takes them, and they—devils and ogres, acrobats and spectators—are caught up in a frenzy of violence. Only when it is over does the horror of the event sink in.

A **Rakdos** carnival is more than the sum of its performers and its audience. It is a frenzy that grips those present, a fiendish madness that comes on suddenly and departs just as quickly, leaving gore in its wake. The carnival, in fact, has a life of its own—and when adventurers face the Cult of **Rakdos** in the midst of a revel, the carnival is one more foe arrayed against them.

When at least six **Rakdos** performers perform together in public, they can call on the carnival to aid them. When determining the difficulty of such an encounter, consider the carnival to be one additional creature of challenge rating 3.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the carnival takes a lair action, causing one of the following effects; the carnival can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Fire erupts from the ground at up to four points of the DM's choice in the carnival. The fire lasts for 1 minute or until this action is used again. Each jet of flame is a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 5-foot radius. Each creature in the cylinder when it first appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that starts its turn in the flames must also make the saving throw.
- Whirling blades, spiked chains, or other implements of agony appear for a moment to menace 1d6 random creatures in a 20-foot cube. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) force damage.
- Blood splashes all creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within the carnival. Each creature in that area becomes the target of a *confusion* spell (save DC 15).

#### Regional Effects
The carnival exerts a powerful influence over those who come close to the festivities:

- When a creature that is outside the carnival sees or hears it, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or use its movement each round to move toward the carnival. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.
- If a creature attempts to leave the carnival, the creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature instead moves toward the center of the carnival. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.

If all the **Rakdos** performers in the carnival die or leave its area, these effects end immediately.

## Selesnya NPCs
Those drawn to the Selesnya Conclave find the guild's mission of inclusion and harmony appealing. They gain comfort and fulfillment from the guild's peaceful coexistence with civilization and untamed nature. But the guild's drive isn't only to draw people into a peaceable community: the Selesnya aim to build an army. They aren't naive; they realize that the ambitions of other guilds will lead to violence, and they plan to be prepared for it.

Despite the guild's atmosphere of peaceful quietude, many of its members have military roles. The Selesnya NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

##### Selesnya NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Equenaut (cavalry) | **Scout** mounted on a **pegasus** |
| Ledev guardian (outrider) | **Knight** mounted on a **dire wolf** |
| Religious leader | **Priest** or **druid** |
| Selesnya soldier | **Soldier*** or **veteran** |
| Shepherd | **Horncaller*** |
* Appears in this chapter
![[146-608.png|right|300]]

### Trostani
The Selesnya guildmaster is an amalgamation of three dryads in body, will, and soul. Each dryad's body extends from a central trunk, so while they possess independent minds, they share a single name—**Trostani**—and a single life force. Usually **Trostani** communicates the will of the Worldsoul with one voice, but she retains three distinct personalities that embody the three parts of the Selesnyan ideal: order, life, and harmony. In the midst of increasing tensions on Ravnica, the three personalities have recently been at odds over how best to navigate the conclave through such difficult times.

**Trostani** spends most of her time in the towering tree of Vitu-Ghazi, the Selesnya guildhall. There she communes with Mat'Selesnya and with the dryads who lead individual Selesnya communities across Ravnica.

#### Trostani's Traits

>**Ideal**: "In each of us is the strength of all of us."
>
>**Bond**: "All will come to the warm embrace of the Conclave."
>
>**Flaw**: "I have nothing but anger for those who break the bonds of the community and leave our embrace."
>

![[147-636755119753822988.png|right|300]]

### Horncaller
Specialized shamans called horncallers use their magic to call wild beasts to fight alongside Selesnya troops. In quieter times, they tend the animals associated with Selesnya enclaves and parks.

![[148-636755120204143679.png|right|300]]

> ##### Emmara Tandris
>An elf priest, Emmara Tandris is committed to pursuing peace between the guilds with all her heart, even as **Trostani** hesitates in self-conflict. As a friend of Jace Beleren, she understands that he's never going to be able to settle on Ravnica, so she believes the world needs a replacement for the Guildpact. Emmara plays an active role in her community, and she has many non-Selesnya friends aside from the Guildpact. One of the most active advocates of cooperation among the guilds, she is relying on personal connections with members of other guilds to help that effort.

## Simic NPCs
Curiosity about the manifold wonders of life—as well as the magical science involved in modifying it—leads inquisitive and ambitious minds from across Ravnica to join the Simic Combine. Grouped together in clades and projects, Simic scientists look for new ways to speed the nature's processes of adaptation and evolution, preparing organisms of all kinds that can thrive in the dangerous and ever-changing urban environment.

Most Simic researchers are humans, vedalken, elves, and merfolk, or at least they were born that way. During their careers, they might give themselves such a wide variety of adaptations and augmentations that their heritage is hard to ascertain. The Simic NPCs table summarizes key roles within the guild. Statistics for these NPCs are found in the *Monster Manual* unless the table states otherwise.

![[149-609.png|right|300]]

##### Simic NPCs
| Role | Appropriate Stat Block |
|---|---|
| Biomancer (creates hybrids) | **Biomancer*** |
| Forcemage (grows flora and fauna) | **Druid** |
| Terraformer (alters environments) | **Druid** or **mage** |
* Appears in this chapter

### Prime Speaker Zegana
The regal and reticent Prime Speaker **Zegana** is the merfolk guildmaster of the Simic Combine. She upholds the traditional ways of the guild and its utopian philosophy, which espouses a vision of an ideal world in which nature and civilization coexist in perfect balance. Some people in the guild—members of the Adaptationist faction in particular—argue that her ways are outdated and the guild requires more practical leadership. In response, **Zegana** maintains that she serves as prime speaker only at the sufferance of the Speakers' Chamber, and if the other speakers wish to replace her, they are certainly within their rights to do so.

#### Zegana's Traits

>**Ideal**: "Nature's patterns are the schematics for how to improve."
>
>**Bond**: "I will use all the resources at my disposal to see that Ravnica becomes the best it can be."
>
>**Flaw**: "I can't understand how progress could ever be the wrong goal."
>

![[150-636755120782000992.png|right|300]]

### Biomancer
Nearly all the innovation and advancement in Simic bioengineering comes from the work of biomancers. Specialists in hybridizing and altering creatures through a mixture of science and magic, they have spawned countless hybrids and krasis in search of the perfect union between nature and civilization.
