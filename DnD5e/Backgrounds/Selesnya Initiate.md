# Selesnya Initiate

You are a member of a blessed community, built on the ideals of harmony. Here, nature and civilization coexist peacefully, living and growing in accordance with the will of the Worldsoul, Mat’Selesnya. As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you are surrounded by people and other creatures who share your worldview and your longing for deeper spiritual communion with the world, and you have a fervent desire to share the joy you have experienced with Ravnica. Along with the rest of the conclave, you are committed to resisting the ambitions of the other guilds — with military force if necessary.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Nature, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument
- **Languages:** Choose one of Elvish, Loxodon, or Sylvan
- **Equipment:** A Selesnya insignia, a healer’s kit, robes, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)

## Feature: Conclave’s Shelter

As a member of the Selesnya Conclave, you can count on your guild mates to provide shelter and aid. You and your companions can find a place to hide or rest in any Selesnya enclave in the city, unless you have proven to be a danger to them. The members of the enclave will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives in this effort.

In addition, as a guild member you can receive free healing and care at a Selesnya enclave, though you must provide any material components needed for spells.

## Spell List

For you, the spells on the Selesnya Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

| Spell Level | Spells                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cantrip     | [[druidcraft]], [[friends]]                                        |
| 1st         | [[animal friendship]], [[charm person]]                            |
| 2nd         | [[aid]], [[animal messenger]], [[calm emotions]], [[warding bond]] |
| 3rd         | [[plant growth]], [[speak with plants]]                            |
| 4th         | [[aura of life]], [[conjure minor elementals]] .                   |
| 5th         | [[awaken]], [[commune with nature]]                                |

Members of the Selesnya Conclave refer to their magic as “doruvati,” a Sylvan word meaning “gift.” When you use these gifts of Mat’Selesnya, graceful swirls of green and silver light dance in the air around you, and phantasmal green leaves might waft through the air. A sensation of gentle warmth and the smell of spring flowers or autumn leaves might accompany your spells.

## Suggested Characteristics

Most members of the Selesnya Conclave are true believers — the tight-knit community allows little room for the cynical or disillusioned. They are spiritual, empathetic, and generally peaceful — unless roused to action. Their flaws and bonds alike grow naturally from their close ties to the community.

| 6   | I’m trying to atone for the life of crime I led before I joined the Selesnya, but I find it hard to give up my bad habits. |

### Contacts

The Selesnya Conclave is all about connections, so its members cultivate contacts throughout the guild. The guild also engages in energetic recruitment to draw converts from other guilds, and often these new guild members maintain friendships with former guild mates.

Roll twice on the Selesnya Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Selesnya Contacts table.

Although the guild teaches the importance of subjugating the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also celebrates the diversity of individuals, in the same sense that a field that produces different crops is healthier than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies to your skills as an adventurer. As long as your efforts are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild rather than your private agenda, you’re allowed to put your talents to work in your unique way.

That said, you must never lose sight of the fact that you are part of a larger community. That includes the whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start with your vernadi (enclave) and its voda (dryad leader). The dryads want to know what you’re doing and what purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actions — or even expel you from the guild — if they determine that you aren’t serving Selesnya’s best interests.
