# Draconic Transformation
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a statuette of a dragon, worth at least 500 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

With a roar, you draw on the magic of dragons to transform yourself, taking on draconic features. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

- **Blindsight.** You have [blindsight](/rules/senses.md#blindsight) with a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) creature, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
- **Breath Weapon.** When you cast this spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns for the duration, you can exhale shimmering energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Wings.** Incorporeal wings sprout from your back, giving you a flying speed of 60 feet.

**Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
