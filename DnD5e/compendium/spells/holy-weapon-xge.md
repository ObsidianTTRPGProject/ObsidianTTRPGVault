# Holy Weapon
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded). At the end of each of its turns, a [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Classes**: Cleric, Paladin
