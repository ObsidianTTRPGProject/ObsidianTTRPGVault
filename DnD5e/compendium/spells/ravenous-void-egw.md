# Ravenous Void
*9th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 1000 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a small, nine-pointed star made of iron
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive gravitational force centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell's duration, the sphere and any space within 100 feet of it are difficult terrain, and nonmagical objects fully inside the sphere are destroyed if they aren't being worn or carried.

When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, unsecured objects within 100 feet of the sphere are pulled toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.

A creature that starts its turn within 100 feet of the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible. A creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5d10 force damage and is [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until it is no longer in the sphere. If the sphere is in the air, the [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature hovers inside the sphere. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.

**Classes**: Wizard (Graviturgy)
