# Negative Energy Flood
*5th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, a broken bone and a square of black silk
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a [zombie](/compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the [zombie](/compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) are in the Monster Manual.

If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn't make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.

**Classes**: Warlock, Wizard
