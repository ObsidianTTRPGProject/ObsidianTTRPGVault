# Poisoner
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 80*  

You can prepare and deliver deadly poisons, granting you the following benefits:

- When you make a damage roll that deals poison damage, it ignores resistance to poison damage.
- You can apply poison to a weapon or piece of ammunition as a bonus action, instead of an action.
- You gain proficiency with the [poisoner's kit](/compendium/items/poisoners-kit.md) if you don't already have it. With one hour of work using a [poisoner's kit](/compendium/items/poisoners-kit.md) and expending 50 gp worth of materials, you can create a number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus. Once applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and become [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the end of your next turn.
