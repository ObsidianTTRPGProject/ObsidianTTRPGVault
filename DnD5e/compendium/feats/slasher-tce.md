# Slasher
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 81*  

You've learned where to cut to have the greatest results, granting you the following benefits:

- Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack that deals slashing damage, you can reduce the speed of the target by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
- When you score a critical hit that deals slashing damage to a creature, you grievously wound it. Until the start of your next turn, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls.
