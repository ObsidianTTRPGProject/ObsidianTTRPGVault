You are expert at slinking through shadows. You gain the following benefits:

- You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.

- Dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks relying on sight.
