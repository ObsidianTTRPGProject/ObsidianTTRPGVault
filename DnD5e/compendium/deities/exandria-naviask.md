Once a powerful balor pursuing total annihilation of the Feywild, Naviask was transformed into a fey spirit by Queen Titania of the Summer Court after falling into one of her traps. Titania's magic changed Naviask's mission to destroy into a quest to heal scarred lands with nature. After the Calamity, Naviask was drawn to Exandria, where he currently remains, seeking to heal the devastation and ruin that still plague the world.

Naviask's followers say that the strange demon-turned-fey wanders the wastes of Xhorhas but is only glimpsed by those he wishes to see him. He aims to heal the land, but the magics that destroyed Ghor Dranas do not easily fade. He searches for those of similar heart and offers to share his power, so that the land might finally be healed.

## Appearance

Naviask retains his balor shape, but his demonic profile is softened by a verdant hue, and the flowers and vines that adorn his body. The former demon's inner fire has been replaced with sunlight, and he wields a whip made of pure radiance.
