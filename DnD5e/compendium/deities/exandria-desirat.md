Desirat was the companion and mount of Asmodeus during the great wars of the Calamity. Before the Divergence, she was torn from her master by the remnants of the original Cerberus Assembly, who wished to study and harvest the phoenix's fiendish form for their own purposes. After the assembly was destroyed in the war and the pantheon was banished from Exandria, the phoenix remained chained beneath the Cyrios Mountains. Her shadowed flames have scalded and scarred the realm above for centuries, giving birth to the thermal phenomena surrounding Mount Metiri in Western Wynandir.

Desirat's sanity has fractured in isolation, lending to delusions of divinity, which she perpetuates in the hearts of those who carry a seed of fiery vengeance by reaching out to them through dreams and visions. Though she once amassed a following with the aid of Uk'otoa's worshipers, who nearly dug deep enough to free her, her followers were then subjugated and scattered when the Julous Dominion took power in the Marrow Valley. She now speaks to the minds of those who lie spurned and angry at night, calling them to unlock their inner flame and let Desirat aid them in their vengeance.

## Appearance

Desirat is depicted as a giant phoenix of dark purple down, wreathed in purple-black flames. Her sword-like beak is pointed and smooth, while her three onyx eyes peer from beneath bright, burning lids.
