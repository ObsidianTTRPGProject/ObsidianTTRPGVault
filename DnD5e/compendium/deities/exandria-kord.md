Where thunder booms and conflict rises, prayers to the Storm Lord are shouted into the maelstrom. Reveling in all tests of strength, Kord blesses those who prove themselves on the battlefield. Worshiped by athletes and warriors all across Exandria, he exalts those whose force of spirit and desire for victory call his attention. He brings tumultuous storms over land and sea, and those who wish for clearer skies offer their praises and prayers to appease him.

Kord dwells among the roving settlements and battlefields within the rugged and glorious realm of Ysgard, where struggle, victory, and celebration shape the landscape and those who reside there.

## Depiction

Within his temples, Kord is shown as a quintessential warrior, often nude with a beard and short, curled hair. As the epitome of muscle and strength, most art depicts the Storm Lord in a stance of dominance, and perhaps wrestling a terrible beast.

## Holy Day

Kord's holy day is the Day of Challenging, which is celebrated on the seventh day of the second month. The Day of Challenging is one of the most raucous holidays in Port Damali, and thousands of spectators attend the annual Godsbrawl held in the Temple of Kord to root for their favored deity's champion, particularly the chosen champions of the Storm Lord and the All-Hammer.

## Commandments of Kord

- Bravery above all. There is no glory in cowardice.
- Strength is the path to greatness, but greatness is the responsible use of strength.
- The glory of the Storm Lord lives through your own glory on the battlefield.
