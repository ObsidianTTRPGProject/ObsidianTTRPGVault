Before the Calamity, eight of the Betrayer Gods each forged a sentient weapon using the life force of a greater fiend and gave the weapon to a chosen champion in the kingdom of Ghor Dranas. The Calamity flung these weapons across Wildemount, burying them in mountains, forests, fields, and underground. Several of these weapons have been recovered, but a few have never been found and are highly sought-after. The weapons—or more properly, the fiends bound inside them—attract their own followings of mortal worshipers.

When an Arm of the Betrayers is found, it grants its wielder some of the power of the Betrayer Gods and the wisdom of the fiend within. The bound fiends know that their war was lost long ago, but they still desire to be used in battle, win victories, and spill blood in the hands of skilled warriors. As a weapon's wielder becomes more powerful, so too does the weapon, which in turn is able to lend even more magic to the wielder. Whenever a weapon's wielder dies, the weapon disappears and reappears elsewhere.

The Betrayer Gods made the following weapons, which are described in more detail in "chapter 6":

Blade of Broken Mirrors. This stone dagger of Tharizdun has yet to be found after the Calamity. It has the power to warp reality around its wielder. The life force of a [glabrezu](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/glabrezu.md) named Ragazuu was used to forge the weapon.

Grovelthrash. This obsidian warhammer carries the tortured will of Torog and can raze whole structures with a single strike. The life force of an [ultroloth](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/ultroloth.md) named Ciria was used to forge the weapon.

Lash of Shadows. This Zehir-touched whip ends in five serpent heads that pump poisons of varying effects into the wielder's foes. The life force of a [marilith](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/marilith.md) named Sizlifeth was used to forge the weapon.

Mace of the Black Crown. This mace with a fiend's head of ruby carries the boon of Asmodeus, capable of summoning devils for the wielder to command and burning hot enough to melt steel. The life force of an [erinyes](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) named Xartaza was used to forge the weapon.

Ruin's Wake. This Gruumsh-blessed ivory spear can effortlessly pierce armor and transforms into lightning when hurled. The life force of a [balor](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/balor.md) named Yarrowish was used to forge the weapon.

Silken Spite. This rapier has a blade forged from spider silk that gives the wielder Lolth's blessing. The life force of a [yochlol](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/yochlol.md) named Sinnafex was used to forge the weapon.

The Bloody End. This adamantine morningstar bears the boon of Bane, and has yet to be found after the Calamity. It has the power to subjugate the wielder's enemies. The life force of a [pit fiend](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) named Izeelzee was used to forge the weapon.

Will of the Talon. This war pick bears the mark of Tiamat and makes the wielder impervious to the elements and grants them the power of dragon breath. The life force of an [bone devil](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) named Ashtyrlon was used to forge the weapon.
