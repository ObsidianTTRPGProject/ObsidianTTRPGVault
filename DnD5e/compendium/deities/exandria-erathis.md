The inspiration behind many great inventions, the creation of vast cities, and law and order within society, Erathis claims dominion over civilization. Judges and rulers pay respect at her temples, which are central structures in many cities across Exandria. Peace and order through structure and law guides the will of her devout followers. The Law Bearer has a tempestuous romance with Melora the Wild Mother, a furious love that is tempered only when civilization and nature are in balance.

Erathis resides within the glorious divine metropolis of Hestavar, the Bright City. This glowing oasis coasts through the Astral Plane, as the Law Bearer watches over the denizens bathed in the endless daytime that illuminates the busy streets.

## Depiction

Erathis is shown in most texts and statues as a hooded, armored woman sitting atop a throne of pillars. Her face is generally obscured or depicted without expression, giving her presence an impartial yet imposing nature.

## Holy Day

The Law Bearer's holy day is Civilization's Dawn, which is celebrated on the autumnal equinox, usually the twenty-second day of the ninth month. In the Dwendalian Empire, people celebrate by having feasts in honor of the laws of the Dwendal bloodline. One seat at every table is left open for the king, who eats in spirit with the people he rules.

## Commandments of Erathis

- Utilize the company and aid of others. The efforts of the individual often pale against the capabilities of the community.
- Strive to tame the wilds in the name of civilization, and defend the points of light and order against the chaos of darkness.
- Uphold and revere the spirit of invention. Create new settlements, build where inspiration strikes, and expand the edicts of the Law Bearer.
