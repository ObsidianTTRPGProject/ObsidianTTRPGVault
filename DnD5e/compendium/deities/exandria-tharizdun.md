It is darkness unending, less like a god and more like another world. Life and death do not exist within Tharizdun, only utter destruction and madness. Even the other Betrayer Gods treat this mad god with caution. In its endless imprisonment, Tharizdun dreams the infinite depths of the Abyss into reality, along with all its demonic legions. The Prime Deities had thought it locked away during the Founding until it nearly returned to ruin the world during the conflicts of the Calamity.

Now, its chaotic mind has fallen into more frightful dreams, imagining nightmarish aberrations into existence deep beneath Exandria. The Chained Oblivion's demented cultists work without word from their twisted patron, awaiting the Epoch of Ends, when its freedom will be attained and all beings shall be consumed in deathlessness unending.

Tharizdun is believed to be chained in the deepest pits of the Abyss, bound by divine shackles that slowly weaken, leaking its madness into the planes.

## Depiction

Few visual attempts to depict Tharizdun exist, but the texts speak of a creature of rolling, hungry ink and darkness, a spreading cloud of lightless destruction born from a thousand ravenous mouths. Current references show the nightmare constrained by chains of gold and black, barely keeping the dark at bay.

## Enemies

The few remaining followers of Ioun are dedicated to ensuring that Tharizdun is never again unchained. Ioun led the charge against the all-consuming destroyer god's reemergence, and her bravery allowed the other Prime Deities to shackle their enemy, though the victory nearly cost her immortal life. Some say Ioun can only be fully restored if the Chained Oblivion is destroyed for good.

## Commandments of Tharizdun

- Offer and siphon power to Tharizdun until his liberation comes.
- Uncover, restore, and exalt forgotten shrines and relics in his honor.
- Ruin and raze the realms to prepare for the Epoch of Ends.
