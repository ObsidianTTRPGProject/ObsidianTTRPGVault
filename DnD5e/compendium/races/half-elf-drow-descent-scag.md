## Traits

### Age

Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.

### Size

Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

### Darkvision

Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put you to sleep.

### Skill Versatility

You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.

When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the [darkness](/compendium/spells/darkness.md) spell once per day; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait.
