## Traits

### Age

Like humans, aven reach adulthood in their late teens and can live into their 80s.

### Alignment

Aven are inclined toward the lawful good alignment of the Church of Serra

### Size

Aven stand from 5 to 6 feet tall, but their bodies are slender and their bones are partially hollow to facilitate their flight. Your size is Medium.

### Flight

You have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't use your flying speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for encumbrance, you can't use your flying speed if you are encumbered.) 

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Aven.

### Hawkeyed

You have proficiency in the [Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception) skill. In addition, attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
