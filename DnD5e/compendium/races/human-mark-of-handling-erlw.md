## Traits

### Age

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

### Size

Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

### Wild Intuition

When you make a Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) or Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Primal Connection

You can cast the [animal friendship](/compendium/spells/animal-friendship.md) and [speak with animals](/compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md) spells with this trait, requiring no material component. Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a short or long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### The Bigger They Are

Starting at 3rd level, you can target a beast or monstrosity when you cast [animal friendship](/compendium/spells/animal-friendship.md) or [speak with animals](/compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md), provided the creature's Intelligence score is 3 or lower.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Handling Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
