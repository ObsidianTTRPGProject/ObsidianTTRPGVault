## Traits

### Age

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

### Size

Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.

### Courier's Speed

Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.

### Intuitive Motion

When you make a Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check or any ability check to operate or maintain a land vehicle, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Magical Passage

You can cast the [misty step](/compendium/spells/misty-step.md) spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Passage Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
