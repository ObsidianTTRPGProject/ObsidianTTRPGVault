### Breath Weapon

You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

### Damage Resistance

You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Forceful Presence

You can use your understanding of creative diplomacy or intimidation to guide a conversation in your favor. When you make a Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, you can do so with advantage. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
