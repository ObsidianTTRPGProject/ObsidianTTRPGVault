# Chapters 11 and 12: Death to the Wyrmspeakers
*Source: Rise of Tiamat, p. 124* 

From their first discovery of the dragon masks in _Hoard of the Dragon Queen_, the characters will have recognized the importance of the masks to the Cult of the Dragon.

Over the course of the adventure, the heroes have two chances to come face to face with the wyrmspeakers of [Severin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/severin-rot.md)'s inner circle, perhaps claiming their dragon masks and hindering [Severin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/severin-rot.md)'s plans.

This section comprises two distinct chapters. In the first chapter, the characters track [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md), keeper of the [White Dragon Mask](/compendium/items/white-dragon-mask-rotos.md), to an ancient crypt overrun by yuan-ti in the Serpent Hills. In the second chapter, the adventurers go up against [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md), wyrmspeaker of the [Green Dragon Mask](/compendium/items/green-dragon-mask-rotos.md), in a hidden stronghold and dragon lair in the Misty Forest. These chapters play out at different points during the first and second sessions of the Council of Waterdeep, but are presented together because they form two halves of a single mission—taking the fight to the wyrmspeakers as a means of thwarting [Severin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/severin-rot.md)'s plots.

Three of the five wyrmspeakers of the cult—[Galvan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galvan-rot.md) the Blue, Rezmir the Black, and [Severin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/severin-rot.md) himself, who wears the [Red Dragon Mask](/compendium/items/red-dragon-mask-rotos.md)—are already at the Well of Dragons and beyond the party's reach. However, the white wyrmspeaker [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) is forced to leave the security of his stronghold after losing possession of the [White Dragon Mask](/compendium/items/white-dragon-mask-rotos.md), while the green wyrmspeaker [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) engages in raids against the elves of the Misty Forest with his draconic ally, Chuth. When word comes to the Council of Waterdeep that two of the five wyrmspeakers might be at large, the adventurers seize the opportunity to strike.

## Varram the White

[Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) the White is a close ally and confidant of [Severin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/severin-rot.md), but the Cult of the Dragon leader is unaware of how his old friend's actions have threatened the cult's plans. [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md)'s [White Dragon Mask](/compendium/items/white-dragon-mask-rotos.md) has gone missing, stolen by a thief allied with the Zhentarim and now hidden from normal scrying magic. [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) is desperate to retrieve the mask before [Severin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/severin-rot.md) discovers it is missing, and so he has created the pretense of taking a group of trusted followers to seek out a site of ancient magic in the Serpent Hills, which he claims will help the cult in its plans to summon [Tiamat](/compendium/bestiary/npc/tiamat-rot.md). In truth, [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) is seeking the Tomb of [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)—site of an ancient divination pool that he hopes will show him the location of the lost mask.

Harper agents have heard rumors of the theft of the [White Dragon Mask](/compendium/items/white-dragon-mask-rotos.md), and Leosin Erlanthar has recently learned that the dwarf [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) was seen in the trade settlement of Boareskyr Bridge, near the Serpent Hills. With the Harpers already spread far and wide on their intelligence-gathering missions, the adventurers are a perfect choice to pursue the wyrmspeaker.

### Following the Trail

Leosin Erlanthar contacts the party during a council session in Waterdeep. After filling them in on the rumors that [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) has lost the [White Dragon Mask](/compendium/items/white-dragon-mask-rotos.md) and gone abroad in search of it, he sends the characters to Boareskyr Bridge, instructing them to seek information on [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md)'s recent movements and probable destination.

This chapter sees the characters journey from Boareskyr Bridge to a forgotten Anaurian ruin in the Serpent Hills. The divination pool that [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) seeks is there—but so too is a clan of yuan-ti that are a threat to the wyrmspeaker and the adventurers alike.

### Boareskyr Bridge

Boareskyr Bridge bears the name of a now-vanished realm north and east of the Trade Way. The bridge spans the Winding Water and is a major landmark. Constructed of black granite, it bears sculpted images of the deities Cyric and Bhaal, commemorating the legendary battle they fought on the bridge during the Time of Troubles.

This way station settlement is little more than a collection of tents, wagons, and caravans providing food, fresh mounts, and other services to travelers. A contingent of paladins from the theocracy of Elturgard maintains watch over the bridge in a newly built keep.

#### Bolo's Tentside Inn

Bolo's Tentside Inn is a rough-and-tumble establishment set up in a large pavilion near the center of Boareskyr's tent city. When the characters make inquiries about [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md), they are directed to Bolo's and its female halfling proprietor.

> "A dwarf in purple robes? Oh, I saw him. He was asking about escorts into the hills, when this hooded fellow starts asking him his business. The dwarf looked him straight in the eye, then pulled out his dagger and stabbed the tall fellow dead! He was one of the scaled folk of the Serpent Hills, come down to spy on us! That dwarf's a hero, make no mistake. But he and his entourage took off straight away for the hills then, quick as cats!"
^0df

[Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md)'s only goal in killing the yuan-ti spy was stopping word of his movements from reaching the Serpent Hills before he got there, but it has made him something of a local hero. Bolo is happy to share what she knows as long as the characters don't let on that they intend to harm the dwarf.

[Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) traveled with more than a dozen other companions, including a handful of cloaked and hooded warriors. She assumed them to be barbarian mercenaries, but [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) is actually traveling under the protection of a force of bearded devils. The dwarf headed into the Serpent Hills after killing the yuan-ti.

### The Serpent Hills

Good weather and the fact that [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) and his large party were moving with haste makes their trail into the hills easy to follow. From Boareskyr Bridge, the adventurers pursue the dwarf into the Serpent Hills—a swath of badlands, mesas, and rocky plateaus sprinkled with trees and tall grass. [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md)'s trail leads some sixty-five miles north-northeast.

Lizardfolk and nagas, trolls and giants, and the treacherous yuan-ti all lurk in the Serpent Hills, amid the tombs and ruined settlements of more than one fallen civilization. As the characters pursue [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md), roll a d20 every 6 hours of travel; an encounter occurs on a roll of 17–20. Determine the encounter by rolling on the table below.

^encounter

#### Humanoids

Humanoids ranging into the Serpent Hills might be treasure hunters, escaped slaves from the monstrous land of Najara, or scouts from Elturgard keeping watch on yuan-ti activity.

#### Herd Mammals

Packs of goats, antelope, and other herd mammals range across the Serpent Hills. They avoid other creatures, but can become fierce if threatened or cornered.

#### Hill Giants

The party comes across one or two [hill giants](/compendium/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) gorging on a fallen herd animal. When the giants notice the adventurers, they see the opportunity for another meal. A hill giant retreats when reduced to half its hit points or fewer, preferring prey that does not fight back.

#### Unmarked Grave

A low rise covered in hastily collected rocks marks the resting place of one of the many explorers to have fallen in the Serpent Hills. At your discretion, an unmarked grave at night could become an encounter with a [ghost](/compendium/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) or other restless undead.

#### Shrine

An isolated shrine to one of the many lost gods of Netheril or Anauria rises up out of the desert. Many such sites show signs of having been used as campsites by travelers in the hills.

#### Vultures

Flocks of vultures might be seen circling at a distance, or could harass the characters if they mistake them for lost travelers on their last legs.

#### Ruined Settlement

Crumbling stones and dry wells are all that remain of the many lost settlements of the Serpent Hills.

#### Lizardfolk

[Lizardfolk](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) regularly hunt and gather food for their yuan-ti masters, grabbing humanoid settlers along the fringes of the hills when they can.

## Tomb of Diderius

The Tomb of [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) and its magic pool are hidden within a complex of chambers carved into a towering cliff. Originally part of the manse the wizard [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) built around the mystical divination pool, the complex was converted to a crypt only after his death. The crypt looks down over the ruins of the town that grew up around the magic pool to cater to those who came seeking [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s wisdom.

The town once nestled into a canyon between two bluffs, but only a few ruined stone structures and the slab foundations of administrative and temple buildings now remain. Cave entrances dot the bluffs, marking former residences and simple tombs. None of the ruins hold anything of value or interest, but the caves offer safe places for the party to rest.

Knowledge of the settlement that once stood here has been lost to all except Ilda, a ghostly librarian in area 9 of the crypt, who has answers to many forgotten questions. As well, though few seek the pool these days, a small yuan-ti colony known as Ss'tck'al has arisen behind the crypt. The yuan-ti use humanoid sacrifices to power the divination pool's magic, learning dark secrets that fuel their insidious plots.

### General Features

Unless otherwise specified, the floor and walls of the dungeon are sandstone blocks and flagstones. The walls are cool to the touch and the air is cold.

#### Ceilings

The tomb's ceilings are 10 feet high unless otherwise noted.

#### Light

Unless specified otherwise, there is no light inside the tomb.

#### Regional Effects

When [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) died, those who honored him in life transformed him into a special [mummy lord](/compendium/bestiary/undead/mummy-lord.md) whose magic pervades his tomb. Since [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) is neutral rather than evil, the area lacks dark magic common to other mummy-lord tombs. A few chambers of the tomb have the appearance of opulent and well-kept rooms suitable for a noble archmage. This effect is an illusion, however, failing to cover the rank scent of dust and decay. [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s magic also guides those who show proper respect.

### Tomb of Diderius (areas 1-6)

### 1. Entrance Plaza

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The entrance to [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s tomb stands in what was once a large paved plaza. The remains of a fountain are now little more than a stone circle set around a crumbling hole in the ground leading to a well deep below. Two stone statues stand in the courtyard, rising twenty feet high. Behind them, a forty-foot high edifice is carved into the cliff side, dominated by relief columns carved with strange, otherworldly scenes.
^0f2

The left-hand colossus is a bearded human male wearing exotic clothes, but its face is smashed beyond recognition. It holds a balance in its right hand and a cudgel at its side, its left hand raised as if in warning. The colossus to the right of the entrance is a young human male wearing similarly exotic clothing, the left half of its head cracked off and lying at its feet. The statue holds a shepherd's crook in its left hand, its right hand raised in warning as well.

The relief-carved scenes around the entrance depict things [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) glimpsed in the divination pool, including other worlds and planes that never came to be. Use your imagination when describing these scenes. The entrance to the crypt is 30 feet up atop a stone stairwell that stops 10 feet short of a platform jutting out from the cliff face. [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md)'s cultists (see below) have left a ladder leaning against the edifice that allows characters to climb up to the entrance.

#### Approaching the Statues

When the party approaches the statues, read the following.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> As you approach the statues, you hear the sudden sound of grinding stone. The colossal figures turn their massive heads, their shattered features staring down at you. Two voices issue forth in unison, booming out as though erupting from the deep earth.
> 
> "Halt. You come before [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md), ether walker and conduit of clairvoyance. Behold ye now his wondrous triumphs. [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) extends wisdom, and [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) offers knowledge. Which do you seek?"
^0f4

If a response of "We seek wisdom," or "We desire knowledge" is given, or the characters roleplay an obsequious or self-deprecating response that might please an egotistical wizard, the statues respond. They say, "[Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) shall grant you what you seek, but only if you heed him and continue to show proper respect!" They then revert to their original positions.

The adventurers' positive response earns them beneficial warnings, courtesy of the magic of [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md). Warnings are detailed in the areas to which they apply.

Any response other than "knowledge" or "wisdom" that is not in some way flattering to [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)—including questions for clarification—results in the statues reverting to their initial positions. The characters are free to continue on into the complex, but they receive no benefit from this interaction.

#### Cultist Campsite and Ruined Fountain

[Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md)'s cultists have made camp in the plaza near the ruined fountain. A campfire is burning down here, and three bedrolls show where the rearguard cultists are camped. Seven shallow graves have been dug east of the campsite—casualties from the cultists' exploration.

The guards are dead, having been dragged off and eaten by trolls living in the tunnels beneath the well. Those sewers remain largely intact, and the 3 [trolls](/compendium/bestiary/giant/troll.md) that dwell there have discovered that using them to move between the crypt and the plaza makes for good foraging in the area. If the party rests here or in area 5, the trolls attack in the night. A troll fights until reduced to one-third or fewer of its hit points before retreating to the safety of the well.

The entrance to the tunnels is too narrow for even a Small character to squeeze through. The trolls dislocate their hips and shoulders to pass through, taking 10 bludgeoning damage that they quickly regenerate.

### 2. Antechamber

While an illusion still shows a tomb with gilded carvings and silver censers, these are mere shadows. Looters have defaced and ruined the relief-carved walls, and the censers are long gone. Set between the carvings are a dozen alcoves recognizable as funerary niches, though these contain only splinters of bone. At the far end of the chamber, a stone door hangs ajar. Marks on the door and frame indicate that it was recently forced.

### 3. Watchful Statues

Six statues stand here, all of cowled wizards leaning on staffs, their faces obscured by deep hoods. The hollows the hoods form are particulalry dark. Niches between the statues once held skeletal guardians that fought the cultists. The bones of more than a dozen humanoids now litter the ground.

Characters who chose well when speaking with the statues in area 1 are struck by a sudden thought when they enter this area: "Some secrets are not meant for mortal minds to know. Look away from the darkness in which such knowledge hides."

#### Statue Trap

 When the first adventurer passes the halfway point of the room, the sound of grinding stone announces the statues turning their cowled heads to follow the characters' movements. The characters must not look into the darkness in the statues' hoods. Any character who does must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw against a [suggestion](/compendium/spells/suggestion.md) spell. Success indicates that the character shrugs off the statue's magic, while failure indicates the character is held by the dark gaze within the stony cowl for 1 round. During this time, the statue whispers impossible secrets to the character, which carry both benefit and burden.

The character must then make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the character cannot grasp the secrets it was shown, and there is no effect. On a success, the character understands the world more accurately, gaining advantage on Intelligence checks for the next 24 hours. However, the character is also driven temporarily insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take actions or reactions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. You control the creature's movement, which is erratic.

### 4. Mosaic Chamber

This chamber is a high vaulted dome with a deep inset ledge circling the room, 10 feet wide and 15 feet up. The floor here is set with a beautiful tile mosaic showing a knight in plate armor wielding a glowing sword against a chimera. The word "SAFE" is written in chalk on the door leading to area 5, marking that chamber as a resting place used by the cultists.

When the first character enters this room, the tile chimera begins to slowly shift. With a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, a character notices this movement and is not surprised as the tiles shoot up and the chimera seemingly claws its way out of the mosaic.

The [tile chimera](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/animated-tile-chimera-rot.md) acts as a normal [chimera](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/chimera.md) magically animated and customized per the sidebar. It makes a clacking noise as it moves, and when injured, it sprays tiles instead of bleeding. It is thin in one dimension and can use that fact to its advantage in combat. The creature flies up to the ledge to use its fire breath at range, flying down to attack in melee until it can breathe again.

> [!quote] Customization: Animated Tile Creature
> 
> An animated tile creature acts like the creature it resembles, except it is a construct that has no need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. The creature also gains the following features.

> 
> A tile creature gains the following reaction.
> 
> **Narrow Dodge.** When targeted by a melee attack, the tile creature can take a reaction to turn its narrowest aspect toward the attacker. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll.
^customization-animated-tile-creature

#### Mosaic Sun

The sun is depicted in the mosaic near the hallway that is area 6—and is actually a sliding circular plate that reveals the bone boulder trap in that area. The plate is only apparent with a successful DC 24 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check or a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

#### Door Hazard

The double doors leading to area 12 are plated in corroded copper engraved to depict a group of wizards peering over a pool of water. The oversized figure of a male wizard at the top of the image raises his hands as if summoning a creature from the pool.

The doors bulge out noticeably from their frame, pushed out by the weight of stone where the ceiling of the corridor between area 4 and area 12 has collapsed. Pulling on either door unleashes enough force to break the hinges and send the doors and a wall of rubble crashing into the room. Any creature within 10 feet of the doors must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw to jump out of the way. On a failure, the creature takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The fall of rubble leaves the hallway filled with stone and impassable.

### 5. Well Chamber

The divination pool used water to create a mirror-like surface for its powerful rituals, which was replenished from this well. The well holds water still, but the regional effects [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) imposes on his lair causes it to evaporate within a few rounds of being hauled up into this area. A bronze bucket on a rope sits near the well, while an empty basin stands 8 feet up along the north wall, with stone steps leading up to it. A brass lever protrudes from the wall near the basin. When water is poured into the basin and the lever pulled, it feeds the sluice in area 12.

The sides of the well and the floor next to it are covered in bright red mushrooms. They are slick with a watery sheen that resembles blood, and have the taste and texture of raw liver if picked and eaten before the lair effects spoil them. They are safe to consume, however.

The cultists used this room as a forward campsite during their short expedition. Sleeping rolls and camping gear are scattered around. As with the door leading into this area, "SAFE" is scribed on the wall in chalk in case anyone became lost or disoriented.

#### Trolls

The well here connects to the reservoir that feeds the fountain in the plaza outside. The [trolls](/compendium/bestiary/giant/troll.md) in that area sometimes come here when their hunting goes poorly and feed on the liver mushrooms. Though the cultists did not encounter them before being taken by the yuan-ti, the trolls attack in the middle of the night if the party uses this area for resting. As on the plaza, the trolls flee down the well if badly injured.

### 6. Hallway

This hallway slants down sharply towards area 7, dropping 15 feet over its full length. Any character who takes a moment to poke around and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices a secret panel halfway down the hallway, large enough for a Small creature to fit through, or a Medium creature that is squeezing. The panel reveals a narrow shaft that once housed a dumbwaiter, which drops down 30 feet to the stairwell leading to area 11. (The cultists discovered this shaft and used it to enter areas 10 and 11, though no sign can be found of their passage.)

#### Bone Boulder Trap

At 15 feet beyond the shaft entrance, a mechanical plate installed in the floor triggers a rolling boulder trap. A successful DC 22 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check by one of the characters in the first rank of the marching order is required to notice this trigger without activating the pressure plate.

If the plate is activated, the circular mosaic pattern that appears as the sun on the floor in area 4 slides back and a 7-foot-diameter sphere made of hundreds of skeletal bodies rises magically from the floor. This bone boulder tilts toward area 6 and rolls down the sloping hallway before crashing against the wall in area 7.

As it rolls through, the bone boulder crushes and slashes at any creature in area 6, dealing 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and 18 (4d8) slashing damage, or half as much damage with a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Any creature that fails this first save is grabbed by skeletal hands and pulled into the sphere, which continues to roll over any other creatures in the hallway.

A creature trapped in the bone boulder can attempt a DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to break free before the boulder slams into the wall in area 7. Any creature that fails to escape is inside the boulder when it hits, and is caught in an explosion of bones and stone, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and 14 (4d6) slashing damage.

### Tomb of Diderius (areas 7-13)

### 7. Throne Room Antechamber

The smell of incense fills this room, and rich tapestries cover the walls. On the south wall, a chute large enough only for a Small character to squeeze through lets in light from outside.

If the characters spoke properly to the statues in area 1, an unfamiliar voice is heard to whisper as they enter this area: "Humility proffered in the manner of Mystril shelters those opening the way to seeking knowledge." A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check reminds a character of a holy gesture among adherents of the fallen goddess Mystril, involving turning the head downward and raising the hands as if holding a lamp. Characters who make this gesture while opening the double doors to the north can pass without difficulty.

#### Sarcophagi

Six sarcophagi are embedded in the walls behind the tapestries, holding the mummified remains of [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s household guards. A character who opens the north double doors without making the proper gesture, or who tampers with a sarcophagus, awakens the 6 [mummies](/compendium/bestiary/undead/mummy.md), which lurch forth and attack.

### 8. Throne Room

A throne on a massive dais resembles a floating cloud concealing a golden sun. Seated on the throne is a twelve-foot-tall, regal and well-muscled humanoid male with a flowing white beard and purple toga—in reality, a [clay golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/clay-golem.md) that [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) used to receive favored guests in this area.

The golem has been imbued with castings of [magic mouth](/compendium/spells/magic-mouth.md). When any character first approaches it, the crea-ture speaks in a soothing, magnificent voice, saying, "Ye who seek [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s insight must first furnish tribute, that [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) might work his mighty magic. Lay such tribute at my feet or depart."

[Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) was not a greedy wizard, and he accepted even meek offerings from the poor in the town. As long as each party member places something more valuable than a clay cup in the treasure pile, the characters are allowed to pass. If the adventurers attempt to steal any of the treasure or to use the door to area 10 without leaving treasure, the golem attacks.

#### Treasure

At the foot of the throne is a pile of treasure containing 250 sp, six fine silver necklaces worth 50 gp each, and a [potion of fire breath](/compendium/items/potion-of-fire-breath.md). Even with a quick glance, characters can see that the pile also contains hundreds of copper pieces and worthless bits of jewelry and pottery.

### 9. Study and Library

The room east of the throne room antechamber was [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s study and library, in which he would meet with sages and travelers. Its dusty shelves and tables are now empty, the scrolls and tomes once held here having been looted long ago. However, the area's unwitting guardian remains.

Ilda is a neutral good [ghost](/compendium/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) who was once one of [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s apprentices. She worshiped her master, but was mistakenly banished as a thief when one of his prize tomes was misplaced. Ilda died not long after [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md), and her spirit returned here to act as caretaker to his great stores of knowledge.

Ilda is not violent except to those who would steal from [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md). She manifests when the characters enter this area, demanding to know why they have come and threatening them if they plan to loot the library. If the characters point out that there's nothing left in the library to steal, Ilda is overcome by a fit of misery as she agonizes over her failures. A successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check reveals that Ilda can be released from her sojourn here if any volumes from the lost library are returned (see area 11).

Although Ilda is not evil, the confrontation with her should still be harrowing. This is a creature whose spirit is tied to the world out of anguish, and any interaction with Ilda should be a precarious process of talking to a character who might fly off the handle at any moment. She might vanish into thin air for no reason, then return in a fury if the characters try to call her back.

If the party manages to converse with Ilda, they might learn that yuan-ti dwell in the innermost parts of the complex. Ilda knows nothing about the cultists, who have not entered this area. If the characters gain her confidence, Ilda can also offer the following information:

- [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s passion was powerful divination magic, which is how he discovered the mysterious pool in this cavern complex. He excavated these chambers around the pool, and kings and wizards came bearing tribute. When he died after many centuries of life, this underground manse became his crypt.
- The divination pool allows those using it to peer past many magical protections that block lesser divination magic.
- The pool's revelations could drive a user insane unless the questions asked were specific and dealt only with the physical world, avoiding metaphysical concerns. Gazing into the pool without first offering a sacrifice was exceedingly dangerous.
- Using the divination pool required a personal sacrifice, but over time, the pool's demands grew steeper. If others have been using the pool since [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) died, as Ilda suspects the yuan-ti do, its current price must be dark indeed.

### 10. Dining Hall

Two long tables of plain stone stand at the south end of this dining hall, while a long marble table stands to the north. The door up the stairs leading to area 8 has "? DANGER" written in chalk on it. The door down the southern stairs is spiked shut, and has "DANGER" scrawled on it in chalk.

Five [bearded devils](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md) are seated at the marble table—the last survivors of [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md)'s expedition. When his cultist followers were routed investigating area 11, [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) left the devils here with instructions to guard against any creatures coming out of that area. The devils take their orders seriously, which means they all but ignore the adventurers unless the characters attack.

If the devils are questioned politely, they tell the characters only that they were ordered to remain here. They admit that their master is [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md), and speak of great treasure down the stairs to the south. The dwarf has been gone for some time, but they have no idea what happened to him.

If the devils are offered 100 gp or more in gems, they also tell the characters that they have fought and killed undead in the complex; that the dwarf lost something important to his cult and needs the divination pool to get it back; and that they are working for the cult on the orders of their lord Zariel, Archduchess of Avernus, who wants [Tiamat](/compendium/bestiary/npc/tiamat-rot.md) out of the Nine Hells.

The characters are free to pass through this room, including entering area 11—but they will be attacked with glee by the devils when they leave that area.

### 11. Treasure Vault

While [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) lived, this area was his bedchamber, and it still contains an elegant bed, sets of bookshelves, a large wooden chest, and a side table set with ewer and goblets. The cultists sealed this room after a disastrous run-in with its undead guardians.

#### On the Stairs

The dumbwaiter shaft from area 6 to the stairwell in front of the vault was once used to bypass the long walk from the bedchamber to the upper parts of the complex for [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s servants. The dumbwaiter's ropes and rotted wooden platform are strewn across the stairs.

This area is guarded by 3 [wraiths](/compendium/bestiary/undead/wraith.md)  and 3 [specters](/compendium/bestiary/undead/specter.md). The wraiths are the spirits of warriors who pledged their souls to [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) in exchange for the wizard's exotic knowledge. They can be defeated in combat, but their spirits are bound to the room by ancient magic, causing them to manifest again 24 hours after being destroyed. The undead are the reanimated souls of three cultists who died here and of three yuan-ti that died exploring the ruins. They do not manifest again if destroyed.

#### Treasure

The bookshelves contain magical treatises and notes on divination that have withstood the ravages of time. They detail the spellcasting practices of ancient Netheril, and will fetch 750 gp if sold. If the characters search the room, they find a crumbling book titled _Transubstantiality across Potentialities_ stuck between the bed and the wall. If it is returned to the library (area 9), the ghost is free to move on from this world.

The silver ewer and four goblets next to the bed are magical. If a character pours from the empty ewer into an empty goblet, a fuming gas flows between both vessels. A character who "drinks" from a gas-filled goblet receives advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage for 3 hours. Each of the goblets can be used to produce this effect once per seven days.

The airtight chest holds seven silk robes kept free from rot, and worth 50 gp each if sold.

The chest also holds an amethyst-set [ring of resistance (poison)](/compendium/items/ring-of-poison-resistance.md) and two spell scrolls of [protection from energy](/compendium/spells/protection-from-energy.md).

### 12. Divination Pool

This long gallery holds the magic pool that was the source of [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s power. The double doors to the south have no markings on them, but they feature the same hazard as the doors in area 4.

Broken arrows, bloodstains, and a dead cultist are strewn across the floor of the chamber. A DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals that the arrows were shot from the north doorway leading into area 13. The arrows are carved of stone and their heads are in the shape of fangs, set with the symbol of a cobra with a crown above it. A DC 18 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the symbol of the yuan-ti god Merrshaulk.

If a character inspects the body, it is revealed that the cultist died not from arrows but from a dagger wound. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals that a [dragontooth dagger](/compendium/items/dragontooth-dagger-rot.md) (See appendix C) was the killing weapon. This was the unlucky cultist the duplicitous [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) sacrificed when he used the pool.

#### Pool

The pool is currently empty. [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) had only just completed the pool's divination ritual when the yuan-ti attacked and hauled him off. A stone sluice runs from the southern wall to empty into the pool. If the characters can fill the basin in area 5  and release the sluice quickly enough, the water pours into the pool before it has a chance to evaporate. Alternatively, the pool can be activated with a flask of holy water, which is not subject to the mummy lord's lair effects.

When any water hits the pool, it spreads out and flares with a black light. Any character who received Ilda's warning (or who remembers the statues words in area 3) will hopefully declare that he or she looks away from the pool. Otherwise, a character must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw against a [suggestion](/compendium/spells/suggestion.md) spell. On a failed save, the character is compelled to gaze into the divination pool. unless another character immediately pulls the curious victim away from the pool (and avoids gazing into it as he or she does so). If not pulled away, a gazing character is driven temporarily insane for 1 minute (see area 3). A character pulled away from the pool does not suffer insanity but is [stunned](/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute.

#### Using the Pool

The divination pool has always required that a user make a personal sacrifice to gain its secrets. However, the pool's magic has grown considerably hungrier over the long years of its isolation. In response to the cruelty of the yuan-ti, using the pool requires the sacrifice of all or a significant part of a sentient creature.

### 13. Crypt of Diderius

[Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s final resting place is a 20-foot-high chamber lit by braziers imbued with [continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md). A massive stone sarcophagus sits atop a stepped stone dais at center. The walls are decorated with life-sized frescoes showing the lost gods of Netheril and Anauria. If the party benefits from the boon granted in area 1, all the characters sense it would be disrespectful to disturb anything here—everything should remain as it is.

#### Frescoes

Characters who examine the frescoes can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discover thin plaster on four of them. If any such fresco is broken open, a [mummy](/compendium/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) hidden behind it attacks. The other three hidden mummies, all once [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s advisers, smash free to attack thereafter.

#### Sarcophagus

[Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md), the mummy lord, rests within the sarcophagus. When the characters approach within a few paces of it, a deep, clear voice issues from the coffin, saying, "You approach [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) in repose. I know what you seek."

If the adventurers spoke well to the staues in area 1, the voice says, "Yuan-ti have taken the one called [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) beyond their portal in the northern wall. Be prepared, for I shall open the way to peril." Unless the characters ask [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) to wait, a moment later, with a chiming sound, the secret door opens to area 14. The party gains a surprise round to act against the guards there.

Those who didn't speak well in area 1 must ask [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) about [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) to gain information about his whereabouts. Failure to do so respectfully causes [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) to say, "Leave me to my rest or face your doom." [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) opens the way only for those who are particularly decorous in this exchnage.

If the adventurers try to open the sarcophagus, [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) warns them. If they persist, he attacks. The [mummies](/compendium/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) behind the frescoes also smash free and attack. None of the monsters pursue those who flee this room, which soon returns to its original state.

[Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md) can use mummy lord legendary actions, but he is unusual because he casts wizard spells. He uses his 18 Intelligence as his spellcasting ability (his Wisdom remains 18) and has the following wizard spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): [minor illusion](/compendium/spells/minor-illusion.md), [ray of frost](/compendium/spells/ray-of-frost.md)
- 1st level (4 slots): [charm person](/compendium/spells/charm-person.md), [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [shield](/compendium/spells/shield.md), [thunderwave](/compendium/spells/thunderwave.md)
- 2nd level (3 slots): [cloud of daggers](/compendium/spells/cloud-of-daggers.md), [hold person](/compendium/spells/hold-person.md), [see invisibility](/compendium/spells/see-invisibility.md)
- 3rd level (3 slots): [animate dead](/compendium/spells/animate-dead.md), [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md)
- 4th level (3 slots): [fire shield](/compendium/spells/fire-shield.md), [greater invisibility](/compendium/spells/greater-invisibility.md)
- 5th level (2 slots): [cloudkill](/compendium/spells/cloudkill.md), [wall of stone](/compendium/spells/wall-of-stone.md)

A canopic jar in the sarcophagus contains [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s withered heart.

#### Secret Door

In the northern wall is a secret door that requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to find. Knocking on the stone wall reveals a hollow echo beyond, but the mechanism for opening the door is on the other side. A [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) or [stone shape](/compendium/spells/stone-shape.md) spell can open it, or the door can be forced with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

## Ss'tck'al

Long after [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md)'s death, the yuan-ti discovered the crypt and claimed it as their own. A small group of yuan-ti now lives here, backed up by lizardfolk slaves. They are the caretakers of the divination pool, which high-ranking yuan-ti use to seek magical insight for their far-reaching plots. The yuan-ti have avoided moving into the original chambers of the complex, fearing the undead there. Instead, they have expanded the complex by excavating deeper into the cliff side.

The yuan-ti capture and sacrifice those who visit the tomb of [Diderius](/compendium/bestiary/npc/diderius-rot.md). They are not above cutting a deal to save themselves, however.

### General Features

It is noticeably warmer here than in the crypt, and the air is uncomfortably humid throughout.

#### Walls

The walls of the yuan-ti enclave are worked slabs of dark green stone, slick with slime and moisture.

#### Ceiling

The crypt's ceiling is 10 feet high unless otherwise noted.

#### Light

Unless otherwise specified, there is no light inside the crypt.

### Ss'tck'al (areas 14-22)

### 14. Entryway

This rough natural cavern holds the winch system for raising the stone slab secret door between area 13 and area 14. The doorway is guarded by 6 [lizardfolk](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md), which attack at the first sign of the door rising between this area and area 13. One lizardfolk runs to warn the yuan-ti while the others move into position near the door.

If it takes the characters more than 10 rounds to open the door, 4 more [lizardfolk](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) and 3 [yuan-ti malisons (type 1)](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-malison-type-1.md) show up. The door is then opened from this area and the enemy forces attack. The malisons retreat if one of them is killed. The lizardfolk retreat when half of them are dead.

The eastern stairs descend 30 feet before coming to the bridge in area 15.

### 15. Bridge

The steep stairs from area 14 lead to a 40-foot-long stone bridge extending over a dark pit. The west end of the bridge is 10 feet higher than the eastern edge.

Moisture drips down from the high ceiling, covering the bridge in slick moss that hangs over the edge in green curtains. Any creature moving along of the bridge must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall. On a failed saving throw, a creature can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to cling to the bridge rather than fall off into the darkness.

The pit over which the bridge extends is 60 feet deep at the top of the bridge (to the west) and 50 feet deep at the foot of the bridge (to the east). The area below the bridge is a feeding chamber for the snakelike yuan-ti young (see area 19), which crawl between the two areas through holes in the wall. Any characters or lizardfolk that fall off the bridge take appropriate falling damage, then are attacked by the yuan-ti young. Climbing back up to where the bridge meets either set of stairs requires three successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks.

Any lizardfolk that retreated from area 14 attempt to hold the party off here. In addition, 6 more [lizardfolk](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) crouch on the bridge to reinforce the area, hoping that characters trying to fight their way past fall off into the darkness below. They are supported by 2 [yuan-ti malisons (type 1)](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-malison-type-1.md) armed with bows, which attack from the eastern stairs. The malisons also use [suggestion](/compendium/spells/suggestion.md) spells to tell characters that a fellow party member has been replaced by a yuan-ti spy and should be attacked.

### 16. Meditation Chamber

In this large chamber, the yuan-ti meditate in the name of their dark gods and discuss their own plans and schemes. The northeast and southwest walls of this chamber feature statue shrines to the yuan-ti deities Merrshaulk and Sseth. The other two walls have statues of yuan-ti high priests carved into them, with suits of plate armor arranged as offerings at their feet.

When the characters arrive here, hundreds of snakes begin to slither out of holes in the statues and the corners of the room. Though they are not a threat by themselves, the snakes fill the suits of armor, which rise up to attack as 2 [helmed horrors](/compendium/bestiary/construct/helmed-horror.md) with poisoned longswords.The target of a [snake horror](/compendium/bestiary/construct/snake-horror-rot.md)'s successful longsword attack must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The horrors won't leave this room.

#### Treasure

Four rubies worth 1,000 gold pieces each are set in the eyes of the statues and can be pried out.

### 17. Yuan-ti Quarters

A dozen cylindrical shafts 3 feet wide and 7 feet deep are cut into the stone floor here, and are used as sleeping holes by the lesser yuan-ti. Two Stone totems stand here, both in the form of asps rising up with their mouths open. These totems radiate magic that negates some of the regional effects of a mummy lord's lair in this area, allowing the yuan-ti to store food and water here that does not evaporate or spoil.

This room is presently guarded by 3 [lizardfolk](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) and 1 [yuan-ti pureblood](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/yuan-ti-pureblood.md), unless those creatures have already been encountered in area 18.

#### Dart Trap

The secret door in the hallway leading to area 21 is marked by an archway scribed into the wall. However, a pressure plate is set 10 feet before the archway, revealed by a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. When any creature steps on the pressure plate, darts shoot out from the walls along the length of the hallway, targeting all creatures in the area: +8 to hit, 3 (1d6) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage and be [paralyzed](/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute.

#### Treasure

Characters who search the sleeping holes can find 600 copper pieces, 200 silver pieces, and 150 gold pieces, as well as a [potion of poison](/compendium/items/potion-of-poison.md).

### 18. Long Hallway

The walls of this long hallway seem to undulate, moving back and forth as though the corridor is slithering in the manner of a giant snake. This is only a _permanent illusion_ effect, but it is unsettling all the same.

When the characters reach the turn in the hallway, 4 [lizardfolk](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) charge from the direction of area 22, followed by 2 [yuan-ti malisons (type 1)](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-malison-type-1.md). If the characters moved past the door to area 17 without checking that room, the 3 [lizardfolk](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) and 1 [yuan-ti pureblood](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/yuan-ti-pureblood.md) in that area come charging out.

### 19. Hatchery

The floor of this room is 20 feet below the floor of the adjoining hallways, which are reached by tall ladders. The walls of this yuan-ti hatchery drip with slime, and the floor literally writhes with the room's occupants. Yuan-ti produce copious young, which are consumed by their siblings so that only the strongest survive. A swarm of these young (use the [swarm of poisonous snakes](/compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-poisonous-snakes.md)) crawl through piles of eggs and crushed egg shells littering the floor, and are watched over by 1 [yuan-ti abomination](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-abomination.md) and 3 [yuan-ti purebloods](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/yuan-ti-pureblood.md).

At the first sign of the party, the yuan-ti use [suggestion](/compendium/spells/suggestion.md) as they apologize for any previous strife, stating that their kin meant no harm to the characters. As a show of good faith, the abomination invites the characters to descend the ladders and join the yuan-ti for a feast.

If the characters are completely swayed, the yuan-ti wait until they descend, then they and the swarms attack. If the characters flee, the yuan-ti pursue. If they are attacked from above, the yuan-ti ascend the ladders to fight. The abomination flees any fight if reduced to half its hit points or fewer.

### 20. Lizardfolk Den

This foul-smelling chamber is piled high with trash and filth. The yuan-ti's lizardfolk slaves are kept here. The area is presently empty, with all its residents accounted for in other areas.

#### Treasure

Hidden throughout the lizardfolk's filthy nests are 22 gold pieces and 125 silver pieces in loose coin.

### 21. Prison

The yuan-ti use humanoid sacrifice to power the magic of the divination pool. Their unfortunate victims are held here until needed, but the prison is presently empty.

### 22. Temple

The heart of the yuan-ti settlement, this huge chamber features giant stone serpents along the east and west walls, their open mouths guttering green flames. The leaders of the yuan-ti are here—3 [yuan-ti purebloods](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/yuan-ti-pureblood.md), 2 [yuan-ti malisons (type 2)](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-malison-type-2.md), and 1 [yuan-ti abomination](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-abomination.md) priestess—along with any yuan-ti and lizardfolk that retreated from previous encounters.

The yuan-ti and lizardfolk stand in the shadows of the flickering green flames, ready to attack but understanding that the adventurers are a serious threat if they've made it this far unscathed. At the back of the room, near an altar carved with the form of a giant openmouthed cobra, the comatose [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) has been beaten and bound.

#### Dealing for the Dwarf

If the characters have made any mention of their search for [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) during their previous battles with the yuan-ti or lizardfolk, the yuan-ti abomination priestess holds [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md)'s [dragontooth dagger](/compendium/items/dragontooth-dagger-rot.md) to the dwarf's neck. The priestess has heard of the characters' mission, though she does not know or care why they seek the dwarf.

If the yuan-ti have no idea why the characters have attacked, the priestess knows only that [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) has been begging for his life by promising the yuan-ti great wealth if he is freed. The priestess plans to bargain with the characters by offering them the hypothetical wealth the dwarf has promised her.

Either way, if the characters want [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) alive, the priestess demands that the party leave the complex without killing any more yuan-ti. She is willing to turn over the dwarf, but explains that his soul has been temporarily drawn from his body by powerful yuan-ti magic. When the characters have left the enclave, it will be returned. (The priestess is lying—[Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) is in his present semiconscious state because of the brutal treatment he's received at the hands of the yuan-ti.)

If the characters refuse her offer, the priestess attempts to use [suggestion](/compendium/spells/suggestion.md) to sway whomever she perceives as the party's leader. If that fails and combat breaks out, she slays [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) (he has only 3 hit points remaining), then attacks with her followers.

#### Developments

A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals a secret space and a passage beneath one of the serpent statues in the temple. Within the space is the enclave's treasure hoard, comprising 800 gold pieces, 100 pp, 2 cloudy emeralds worth 500 gp each, a necklace of 22 crysoprase beads worth 20 gp each, and 2 spell scrolls, one of [levitate](/compendium/spells/levitate.md) and the other of [call lightning](/compendium/spells/call-lightning.md). The passage leads to the exit the yuan-ti use to leave the complex without passing through the crypt. The exit is carefully hidden behind a screen of rocks and scrub trees a hundred yards away from the plaza entrance to the ruins.

## Conclusion

If the characters rescue him, [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) remains incoherent until he receives healing magic or finishes a long rest. Once his health is restored, the fallen wyrmspeaker is quick to accept his status as the party's prisoner—if only because he knows that [Severin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/severin-rot.md) will kill him if he makes any attempt to return to the cult. [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) can offer detailed insight into the cult's hierarchy and plans, and can reveal secret sympathizers and traitors within the factions of the Council of Waterdeep, at your discretion. Taking the dwarf alive earns the party significant respect among the factions, though bringing back word of his death is nearly as impressive.

If he is asked about the [White Dragon Mask](/compendium/items/white-dragon-mask-rotos.md), [Varram](/compendium/bestiary/npc/varram-rot.md) grudgingly admits that he saw it in the pool—and that it has already been found and reclaimed by the cult, and is presently at the Well of Dragons.

The characters gain a level at the end of this chapter.

## Neronvain

With the loss of Skyreach Castle at the end of _Hoard of the Dragon Queen_, the Cult of the Dragon's efforts to gather [Tiamat](/compendium/bestiary/npc/tiamat-rot.md)'s tribute were badly compromised. To compensate, the cultists launched several raids against the elves of the Misty Forest, led by Wyrmspeaker [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) and his companion, the green dragon Chuth.

Having fulfilled their quota for the cult, wyrmspeaker and dragon retreated deeper into the Misty Forest, leaving the elven enclaves ruined behind them. However, the survivors of those cult raids would have been astonished to learn that the green wyrmspeaker is [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md)—King Melandrach's exiled son, believed to have died many years before.

On one of his raids, [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) won the fealty of an elf named Galin—a warden of the forest who pledged his service to the wyrmspeaker in exchange for ending the attack on his home village. [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) accepted, using Galin's knowledge of the Misty Forest to help plan raids against other settlements. Galin has so far kept secret his oath to [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md), though he feels tremendous guilt over his actions.

Under King Melandrach's command, the elves of the Misty Forest have stepped up their defenses, and the cult attacks have ceased. Melandrach believes the threat has ended, though his son Alagarthas disagrees. Prince Alagarthas used the Emerald Enclave to search for clues to the source of the raids, and they have learned that an elf seen with the green dragon appeared to command the beast. Both Prince Alagarthas and Delaan Winterhound of the Emerald Enclave believe that more attacks are imminent, and that the green dragon's master might be one of the cult's wyrmspeakers. But what neither realize is that the Green Wyrmspeaker is actually Alagarthas's own half-brother [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md)—the disgraced second son of King Melandrach, exiled by his people and long thought dead. They now seek the adventurers' help to find this dragon master.

### Call for Aid

Delaan Winterhound comes to the adventurers during the Council of Waterdeep or while they are returning to the city after completing another chapter. He speaks of the draconic incursions in the Misty Forest mentioned at the council, and says that the Emerald Enclave's agents have been working with the support of Prince Alagarthas to prevent a new round of attacks. With his agents already scattered throughout the Misty Forest, he wants the adventurers to travel to one of the few dragon-raided settlements left standing in the aftermath—a village called Altand. If Delaan's belief that the mysterious master of the green dragon was one of the cult's wyrmspeakers is true, the survivors of Altand might know something that will help find him.

## The Misty Forest

This chapter takes place within the Misty Forest—a vast woodland concealed by thick mist and rain. Enormous spruce trees dominate the northern end of the forest where Altand is found—and where [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) and Chuth have established their stronghold. The mist in the forest is omnipresent. Though it can be ignored inside buildings, all outdoor areas of the forest are lightly obscured.

### Investigation at Altand

Altand is primarily a wood elf settlement, blending almost seamlessly into the forest around it. The village exists on two levels, with a few structures built on the ground around an ancient monument to an elven ranger. Residences and the village temple are built into the upper boughs of the forest. The elves string rope bridges between these sites and construct circular walkways around the trees.

Like many other settlements raided by the dragon, pulley-operated platforms connect the two levels of the village, and provide an excellent defense against the orcs that occasionally enter the forest as an alternative to raiding human settlements along the Trade Way. However, those defenses proved a deathtrap against the flying green dragon, leaving many elves unable to reach the ground quickly enough to escape.

### Survivors' Tales

Of the three hundred residents of the village, more than half survived the raid—a different outcome than at other raided settlements, where the dragon hunted and killed the elves to the last adult and child. Many of the residents of Altand were on the ground when the attack came. Of the elves in the upper level of the village, many died of the dragon's poisonous breath while waiting to descend, or fell to their deaths as bridges and walkways collapsed under the weight of panic.

Most survivors fled and saw little of what ensued. However, by asking careful questions of a number of villagers, the characters can learn the following:

- The dragon swooped down and attacked on the ground first. Nearly half of the village's victims died during that first assault.
- Humans in the regalia of the Cult of the Dragon followed the dragon, killing all those they found. The village's priest stepped out to lead others in fighting the dragon, but the beast swallowed him whole.
- Some survivors claim to have seen a cultist riding atop the dragon. Most of those refer to the dragon rider as human, like the other cultists. However, a few people report that the figure moved with the grace of an elf.
- With the priest dead, the village's warden, Galin, has become the leader of Altand. Though he was in the thick of the fight, he survived unscathed, and has been a potent force for rallying the survivors.
- The attack lasted only a short while, then the dragon unexpectedly retreated. The cultists followed, but as they fled, they took nothing of value from the village. This is a stark contrast to the dragon's other raids, which were focused on capturing treasure.

### The Warden's Story

Galin the warden is a nervous-looking elf with a dark secret. The folk of the village describe him as suffering from the weight of his new leadership role and the deaths of more than a hundred villagers—including his own wife.

In response to any question about Galin, the characters are directed to his residence in the upper boughs of the village.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Stepping into a modest dwelling suspended among iron-strong boughs, you enter a cozy sitting room. A slim elf sits at a desk, standing to greet you with a forced smile as a raven perched in a nearby cage caws hideously. "Welcome to our village," the elf says. "How can I be of service?"
^133

Galin answers any questions the characters put to him, but his responses echo only what the other survivors know. He claims to have not seen the dragon rider and disbelieves those who say they did, dismissing such reports as the result of fear and chaos during the raid. A successful DC 18 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check reveals that the elf warden is withholding information. If he is pressed on this, he admits that he saw the dragon kill his wife and is wracked by guilt that he could not save her. A follow-up successful DC 16 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check reveals that even this isn't the whole truth, but Galin takes umbrage if the character ply him with any more questions.

### Silent Witnesses

Where the humanoid witnesses to the attack are limited in their knowledge, the characters have other potential resources to draw on. By using [speak with plants](/compendium/spells/speak-with-plants.md), the characters can draw on the impressions and memories of the trees themselves. Though the spell allows only for impressions of the previous 24 hours to be recalled by its subjects, the trees of Altand can report that late the previous night, they witnessed Galin sneaking out of the village and disappearing into the woods, accompanied by his pet raven. Galin has been making this sojourn most nights since the attack, giving [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) information on other elven settlements, which the wyrmspeaker is using to plan his next round of assaults.

If the characters use [speak with animals](/compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md) to question the raven, they learn that Galin walked a mile or more into the woods and came face to face with the green dragon Chuth and his rider the previous night. Remember that an animal intelligence is not as articulate as a humanoid, and it might take subtle coaxing to get the raven to describe a scene that likely frightened it.

The characters might also choose to watch and follow Galin on one of his late night excursions. [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) does not show up that night, but the warden's prearranged meeting place is a spot of flattened brush where a dragon has clearly landed more than once.

### Confronting Galin

If confronted with evidence against him, Galin accuses the adventurers (publicly if necessary) of being in league with the cult and attempting to break the resolve of Altand's survivors. If the characters have access to [zone of truth](/compendium/spells/zone-of-truth.md) or similar magic, he flatly refuses to take part in any further questioning.

Galin will not respond to intimidation. However, effective roleplaying can be used to tap into his guilt. If he is offered commiseration for his wife's death—as opposed to accusations—the warden eventually breaks down. He confesses that after seeing his wife killed, he found himself face to face with [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) in the thick of battle and begged for his life, offering anything in return. [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) took the warden up on his offer, agreeing to spare Galin and leave Altand intact in exchange for information on other settlements that would become the targets of the cult's next round of raids.

Galin does not know the identity of the green wyrmspeaker, or the location of [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) and Chuth's lair. However, from the meeting place, he has watched

the dragon flying off on a course due southeast and he has noticed that the wyrmspeaker's clothes and hair are often wet.

### Into the Forest

[Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md)'s stronghold lies thirty miles from Altand through dense, fog-filled forest. As they seek the wyrmspeaker and his dragon, the characters meet an old druid and must deal with spidery sentries.

#### A Timely Rescue

As the characters travel through the forest, they hear the crunch of a large tree breaking, followed by a female voice crying out. If they investigate, they see a venerable woman with her leg trapped under a heavy fallen tree. She calls out for help when she sees the party. This [druid](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) is the caretaker of this part of the forest.

Three [awakened trees](/compendium/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree.md) are hidden among the other trees nearby—one of which has intentionally and harmlessly fallen across the druid, allowing her to feign injury and draw the characters to her. She guesses correctly that the group are seeking the dragon, and wishes to give them a boon to aid their fight against this scourge of her forest, but she wishes to test their strength of character first. She will not help those who do not help others.

If the characters help the druid without reservation, read the following.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> It takes all your effort to lift the tree, knowing that you put yourselves at risk if it shifts against you. But then even as you are close to freeing the woman, the tree begins to rise on its own. Two other trees standing nearby shift back along the ground as the elf stands and smiles, showing no sign of injury.
> 
> "Heroes at last!" she says. "How many might fall back in fear at the sight of a stranger in the woods, or think first of their own safety before helping another? I grant you my blessing. May your hearts prove true where others fear to tread."
> 
> The woman picks flowers from her hair that you swear were not there a moment ago, then twists her fingers to weave them into garlands as if by magic. She lays a garland around each of your necks, then suddenly transforms into an owl. Her awakened tree servants stomp after her into the forest.
^138

As long as the characters wear these garlands, they are [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) to Chuth's animal spies (part of the magic imbued into the area around the dragon's lair) as they approach [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md)'s stronghold. In addition, the first time a character wearing a garland is confronted by Chuth, he or she feels a stirring warmth from the garland and automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the dragon's Frightful Presence.

If the characters ignore the druid, she calls out pitifully for help as they move away, offering a last lament against their cowardice as they disappear. If the adventurers attack the druid, the awakened trees attack. They fight to the death as the druid turns into an owl and flies away.

#### Spiders' Haunt

A quarter of a mile from Chuth's lair, thin strands of spiderweb begin to be seen, hanging nearly invisible in the misty air. The webs mark the overlap between the dragon's lair and the hunting grounds of a brood of spiders. The webbing combines with the dense mist of the forest to make the area around the lair heavily obscured and difficult terrain, up to when the party reaches the pool (area 1). Because the webs are moist, they do not burn away easily. The direct application of fire destroys webs, but fire doesn't spread among them. A character with a torch can use an action to clear the webs within reach.

As the characters advance, the webbing becomes thicker and shows birds and animals trapped within it. Any movement through the webbing alerts the 3 [ettercaps](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/ettercap.md) and 7 [giant spiders](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) lurking nearby. The ettercaps attack with web garrotes, while the spiders use the webs to drop into the party's midst. If two ettercaps or five spiders are slain, the rest flee.

## Neronvain's Stronghold

The Green Wyrmspeaker has established a stronghold for himself and Chuth within a cave complex in the Misty Forest, its entrance hidden behind a waterfall that tumbles down a high cliff. The green dragon has taken over the largest cavern of the stronghold as one of its many lairs.

[Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) is served by a group of cultist bodyguards, while Chuth has won the service of a number of ettins to help guard the stronghold. The dragon also controls a terrified group of elf prisoners [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) brought back from one of their raids, who fight for the dragon and the wyrmspeaker unless they can be convinced to flee.

Chuth is an [adult green dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-green-dragon.md). Statistics for [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) can be found in appendix D.

> [!quote] No One Home
> 
> When the characters approach the stronghold, there might be a chance that Chuth has left the caves to hunt, or that he and [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) are out scouting future raids. You can determine this randomly as you see fit, or allow the characters to hole up within sight of the stronghold and simply wait for the dragon and the wyrmspeaker to leave.
> 
> Removing Chuth and [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) from the stronghold for an initial foray allows the characters to explore and eliminate the guards without the pressure of an imminent dragon attack. This dungeon is a tough adventure even for higher-level characters, especially with the legendary actions Chuth can use in his lair. Attacking head-on if the dragon is aware of the adventurers' approach is likely a suicide mission.

### General Features

#### Secret Doors

Secret doors inside the stronghold are little more than cracks between chambers, just large enough for Medium creatures to squeeze through. They are obscured behind loose rocks or other cover, and require a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to notice.

#### Light

The stronghold is dark unless otherwise noted.

### Stronghold (areas 1-10)

### 1. Pool

The pool at the foot of the waterfall is 20 feet deep at its center, its surface obscured by an emerald haze that marks this place as a green dragon's lair.

A steep slope descends from the cave behind the waterfall to the entrance to area 2, its surface slick from billowing mist. A character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check or a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to climb or crawl down the slope. Failure indicates that the character tumbles 40 feet down the slope, taking 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. Characters using a rope to descend the slope can do so safely.

#### Dragon Attack

If the characters wear the garlands given to them by the druid, Chuth has no idea of their approach, allowing them to safely pass through this area and into the caves.

If the adventurers did not receive the garlands, or if they took them off for any reason while within a quarter mile of Chuth's lair, the dragon's many animal spies alert him to the party's approach. He waits at the mouth of the cave, clinging to the wall near the entrance. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices movement inside the cave but can't tell what it is (or how large a creature it might be).

Chuth uses his [blindsight](/rules/senses.md#blindsight) to detect when the characters are approaching the entrance to the cave. He then dives through the waterfall, soaring above the characters as he uses his Poison Breath, attacking with surprise if no one in the party noticed him. Characters not wearing the garlands are also exposed to the dragon's Frightful Presence. Characters who fail their saving throws against Frightful Presence likely flee back into the woods, where spiders might be waiting. On the dragon's next turn, it retreats back to area 2 to await the heroes' next move.

### 2. Island Chamber

This large chamber has a 40-foot-high ceiling set with massive stalactites, with smaller stalagmites set across the ground. A pool with a small island in the southeast corner of the cavern is fed by streams of water dripping down through the rock. The southwest face of the cavern is a 25-foot-high bluff, part of which is area 4.

The pool is 50 feet deep, and the island is a column of stone rising from its bottom. To the southeast, 25 feet below the surface of the lake, a 20-foot-wide underwater passageway leads to Chuth's lair in area 10.

If the characters did not alert Chuth to their approach, a group of elf guards (3 [commoners](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) and 1 [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) stand at the northwest entrance to this area, driven by fear into serving the dragon (see area 4). They are expecting more cultists to arrive at the lair, and savvy characters might be able to bluff or roleplay past them. The elves demand the characters' names and ask questions they believe only true cultists would know the answers to, including knowing the identities of the cult's leaders and the structure of its ranks.

Even if they are fooled initially, the elves become suspicious if the characters begin to ask any questions that cultists should know (including questions about [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md), Chuth, or the stronghold). In this event, the elves call out for help and attack at once.

Any fight here draws the creatures in areas 3, 4, and 5, which fight as described below. Chuth emerges from the pool and joins the fight 3 rounds later.

#### Dragon Attack

If the characters were attacked by [Chuth](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-green-dragon.md) at the pool, the dragon clings to the ceiling in this area, using his breath weapon on the characters as soon as they enter the caves. He then crashes down on the party, focusing on elves over any other humanoids with his melee attacks. Chuth refrains from using his breath weapon if doing so might hurt or hinder his allies.

The dragon's roar signals the start of the fight for the servants of Chuth and [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) lying in wait for the adventurers. The elves fire bows from atop the bluff of area 4, while the [ettins](/compendium/bestiary/giant/ettin.md) and cultists wade into melee beside their master. See areas 3, 4, and 5 for creature stats and information. [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) attacks at range from behind the cultists, staying close to the entrance to areas 5 and 6.

If the characters kill or incapacitate all of [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) and Chuth's servants, the dragon hides in the pool and emerges each time his breath weapon recharges. While hiding in the water, the dragon is heavily obscured.Chuth is amphibious and can use any of his attacks underwater, as well as his lair actions. Characters swimming through the underwater passage might be suddenly restrained by underwater vines, making them easy targets for the dragon's breath weapon, or putting them at risk of drowning if they cannot free themselves.

If [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) is reduced to 54 hit points, he summons Chuth to his side and consumes a [potion of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md). If Chuth is reduced to 78 hit points, he likewise seeks out [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) in the fight. The two then fall back to area 10 through the pool.

### 3. Ettin Lair

This filthy chamber features only three huge trash mounds piled against the west walls. This place is home to 3 [ettins](/compendium/bestiary/giant/ettin.md), all of which hate each other. If the adventurers make it this far undetected, the ettins assume them to be more stupid human cultists doing stupid human things. They ignore the characters as they go back to pushing each other around.

With a bit of clever roleplaying, the characters might be able to incite the ettins to fight one another. This costs each ettin 21 hit points and keeps them busy for 10 minutes as they wrestle and shout.

The leader of the ettins is a female named Grunda-Gurga. She has a [belt of hill giant strength](/compendium/items/belt-of-hill-giant-strength.md) but wears it improperly as a sash, receiving none of its benefits and having no awareness of its magical potential.

### 4. Elf Quarters

The tunnel leading to this area rises 20 feet to end in a rickety wooden door, constructed by the elves to keep some of the ettin smell out. This area sits atop an open bluff, with its northeast edges looking out over area 2.

[Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) and Chuth brought a dozen elves back from their raids in the Misty Forest as prisoners—8 [commoners](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md), 3 [nobles](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) with whom [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) converses on occasion, and a [knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) and [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) who are Chuth's playthings.

If the characters have entered the caverns undetected, any elves not on guard duty (see area 2) are here. As long as no alarm has been raised, the elves are hesitant to attack possible guests of [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) or Chuth, but they remain suspicious.

The elves are terrified of Chuth, and the cunning dragon has convinced them that he will free them in time if they are loyal. It takes convincing roleplaying and a DC 17 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to convince the elves to flee rather than wait around for the dragon to eventually tire of and eat them. If the characters received the garlands from the druid and place them on the elves, this automatically convinces them to safely flee.

#### Forgotten Shrine

An ancient shrine stands in the southwest corner of the cavern, showing a young female human holding a basin. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the shrine of Eldath, goddess of waterfalls. Water flows from cracks in the ceiling and onto the statue's head, then into the basin. The long years have etched thin white lines resembling the tracks of tears across the statue's face.

The goddess Eldath still listens at this shrine. Characters who pray for her assistance in fighting the dragon can receive a boon at your discretion, including [water breathing](/compendium/spells/water-breathing.md), [bless](/compendium/spells/bless.md), or other useful spells.

### 5. Cultist Common Room

This area is brightly lit by torches set into roughly carved wall sconces. Long tables made of split logs are where the cultists sit to eat or entertain themselves. A cooking fire burns in the center of the room, its smoke rising out to the central cavern and then out of the caves.

If the alarm hasn't been raised, 5 [dragonclaws](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dragonclaw-hotdq.md) and 1 [dragonfang](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dragonfang-rot.md) cultists (see appendix D) are at leisure here. Unless the characters are wearing cult garb and can roleplay effectively, the cultists immediately recognize them as intruders and attack.

### 6. Cultist Quarters

Rough bunks, bedrolls, and backpacks fill this area. If the alarm hasn't yet been raised, 5 [dragonclaws](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dragonclaw-hotdq.md) and 1 [dragonfang](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dragonfang-rot.md) cultists (see appendix D) are asleep here.

#### Treasure

Hidden under the mattresses in the bunks are a total of 30 gp, 120 sp, 23 ep, and 200 cp, plus a single 5 pound silver trade bar from Baldur's Gate (20 gp).

### 7. Storeroom

The cult keeps considerable quantities of food and alcohol here. Judging by the volume of these stores, [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) is planning a long series of assaults against the elves of the Misty Forest.

#### Treasure

The food is mostly common fare, but [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md)'s personal stock includes 8 bottles of Evermead, each worth 100 gp. Since contact with the elven island of Evermeet is so rare, it is easy to find a buyer.

### 8. Neronvain's Chambers

[Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) has created a lush living space in this rough-walled cavern, decorating it with select art and craftworks from his raids. Rich carpets and tapestries cover the floor and walls of the cavern, which features a hewn-log bed, a large mirror, and a trunk.

The entrance tunnel to this chamber is protected by a [glyph of warding](/compendium/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) attuned to [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md). A DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices the glyph. If anyone but [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) steps within 5 feet of the glyph, it erupts.All creatures within 20 feet of the glyph must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.

If [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) is in the stronghold, he is found in this area only if the characters have managed to come this far without engaging in any combat or causing any alert to be sounded. He is otherwise encountered when he enters the fight against the characters.

#### Treasure

If the characters can collect all the furniture, carpets, tapestries, and art objects from this area, the lot is worth a total of 1,500 gp. However, it should occur to the characters that these goods are the rightful property of the elves they were stolen from.

The trunk is protected by a poisoned needle trap, which can be detected with a successful DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If the trap is triggered, it makes an attack: +10 to hit, 1 piercing damage, and the character is subject to an unusual poison and must attempt a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the affected area (usually the hand struck by the needle) becomes numb in 30 minutes, then becomes transparent 1 hour later. After another 2 hours, the affected area painfully returns to normal as the victim takes 27 (6d8) poison damage. If the saving throw is failed, the effect progresses as above but the victim takes 54 (12d8) poison damage.

### 9. Secret Passage

This secret room is for [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md)'s personal use only. A small shrine to Fenmarel Mestarine—the elven god of outcasts, scapegoats, and solitude—resembles a pair of white eyes peering out from the dark wall above a small basin.

Also present here is a journal that reveals [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md)'s relationship to King Melandrach, whom [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) refers to frequently as "my poor father." The journal also reveals that the [Green Dragon Mask](/compendium/items/green-dragon-mask-rotos.md) is already at the Well of Dragons, under [Severin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/severin-rot.md)'s protection and ready to be assembled into the [Mask of the Dragon Queen](/compendium/items/mask-of-the-dragon-queen-rot.md).

### 10. Chuth's Lair

No one but the dragon and [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) are allowed in this area. Along the east wall is Chuth's portion of the hoard collected from the elves of the Misty Forest, though this pales in comparison to what the cult claimed for [Tiamat](/compendium/bestiary/npc/tiamat-rot.md) and what the dragon possesses in his other lairs. The vaulted ceiling is 60 feet high here.

If Chuth is in the stronghold, he is initially found here only if the characters have come this far without engaging in any combat or sounding any alarm, or if he and [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) have retreated to the lair. If [Chuth](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-green-dragon.md) is encountered here, he uses his breath weapon, legendary actions, and lair actions indiscriminately. He tries to push powerful melee combatants back to the walls, then creates a wall of thorns to fence them in.

Because this is only a small portion of his total hoard, Chuth has no interest in dying to protect it. He flees when he is reduced to half his hit points or fewer. [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) fights until similarly reduced, then makes his way to Chuth and convinces the dragon to flee the caverns.

#### Treasure

Chuth's small hoard contains ten gold trade bars from Baldur's Gate worth 50 gp each, plus 10 pp, 120 gp, 2,400 sp, and 8,000 cp. Feel free to add a couple useful potions or scrolls to the hoard as well.

## Conclusion

This chapter can end either with one or both of Chuth and [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) dead or escaped from the stronghold. If either survives, they retreat to the Well of Dragons and report the adventurers' actions to [Severin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/severin-rot.md). (If appropriate, you might let either Chuth or [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) seek revenge as part of the force that attacks the adventurers in chapter 13.)

In any event, the threat against the Misty Forest is ended. King Melandrach hears of the party's actions and is grateful for the heroes' bravery. However, the discovery that his lost son [Neronvain](/compendium/bestiary/npc/neronvain-rot.md) is a wyrmspeaker fills him with shame and rage.

The characters gain a level at the end of this chapter.
