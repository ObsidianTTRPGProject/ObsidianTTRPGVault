# Part 1: Riverside
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: A Verdant Tomb, p. 4* 

The adventure begins when the adventurers reach the area near the sepulcher, about 40 miles east of the village of Secomber. There the south branch of the Delimbiyr (sometimes called Hark River) runs through reedy marshlands along the feet of cliffs and steep hills that rise to form the High Moors' plateau.

The place they seek is a shrine and once-beautiful mausoleum built by a few wealthy families from Secomber. It is set into a cliff on the south side of the river. Designed to be rustic and remote, the site has fallen into severe disrepair as a result of its distance from Secomber. Many of the families whose ancestors were interred here have since taken their wealth to Waterdeep and never returned. After visitors stopped arriving to remember those buried here, no one came to combat the weather and the waters as they took their toll.

Only one of the participating families stayed in Secomber but fell on hard times decades ago and gradually came to forget their forebears. Their family name was Everlake. The last of them died of old age within the past twenty years.

## The Surrounding Area

The land immediately around the sepulcher is unkempt, avoided even by the goats and sheep of the few shepherds in the region. Trees are rare here. Stray boulders and scrub plants abound.

The grassy ground rises up gradually from the riverbank to where the sepulcher is built into the base of a scrabbly 20-foot cliff. Bits of red granite jut from the cliff and the ground, revealed over long years by the river and the rain. Across the river, wide meadows and wild hedges feed the local sheep.

Two [trolls](/compendium/bestiary/giant/troll.md) stalk the marsh on the sepulcher's side of the river. They're twin brothers, clad in rough leather and raw sheep's wool. They hunt along the riverbank at this time of year, looking for strays from nearby flocks. They attempt to stay out of sight and avoid adventurers, but trespassers who seem especially vulnerable or those who are laden with supplies and treasure stir the trolls' greed, inspiring them to ambush the party.

Five [will-o'-wisps](/compendium/bestiary/undead/will-o-wisp.md) haunt the sepulcher yard, day or night. They are prideful, spiteful things eager to lead living creatures near the waters of the sunken yard or into the clutches of other nearby monsters. Yet each will-o'-wisp is loath to venture inside the sepulcher, which they consider the territory of other, more limited undead. The wisps take pride in moving about outdoors, by sunlight or moonlight. They delight in making other encounters more difficult but never venture deeper into the structure than area 4.

Note that much of the muddy, soaked ground surrounding the sepulcher may be difficult terrain. The sepulcher grounds and the crypts within are shown in map 1.

> The will-o'-wisps can make any encounter here more difficult, so use them sparingly. These creatures raise the stakes for any adventurer who drops to 0 hit points, but raising the stakes isn't always required. These particular will-o'-wisps are also selfish and cowardly, they seldom work together. And these aren't their graves they're defending. They simply like the ambiance of a rotten sepulcher.

## 1. Sunken Yard

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The grounds around the sepulcher are flooded by rain and overflow from the nearby river. Mud and leaves form clogs in the reeds, trapping water in a rough pond surrounded by cattails. The water looks to have partly flooded the sepulcher itself through a few cracks in the facade wide enough to squeeze through.
^00f

The pond is about 4 feet deep. Its bottom is a mix of sucking mud and fallen rocks.

The masonry of the structure's face is eroding from both sides, thanks to the water feature in area 4 and the soaked earth here. Small and Medium-sized creatures can move through the largest crack in the facade; a Large creature can squeeze through it.

Last spring, three [water weirds](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/water-weird.md) flowed into this area when the river overflowed. They remain here still, swirling through the water like transparent snakes and steeping in a sense of sorrow and pride from the crypts beyond. They do not threaten the other monsters that dwell here, but they waste no time attacking those they deem trespassers.

## 2. Garden Shrine

> [!quote] ...

> A stone arch leans in the tall grass here where the slab it on which it once stood has been overwhelmed. The arch frames a small altar and shelf built into a waisthigh alcove in the front of the sepulcher. The top of the altar is a stone bowl for offerings, flanked by two stone settings meant to hold candles or oil for burning.
^011

This ritual shrine was intended as a way to allow visitors to honor the interred even when the sepulcher was sealed. The fact that the shrine has not been used in years has emboldened the will-o'wisps in the surrounding area.

A successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recalls prayers and other customary rites suitable for the shrine, all of which involve lighting candles or lamp oil, or casting light. If the shrine is lit, it attracts all remaining will-o'-wisps at the sepulcher. They arrive angry, ready to attack, and do not leave until the shrine is darkened or they are destroyed.

## 3. Sepulcher Entrance

> The door to the mausoleum beyond hasn't been used in a long time. Caked mud and rusted hinges hold the iron gate fast. Behind that, a stone slab with two metal loops set into it, for ropes, stands firm—more of a seal than a door.
^013

The names of the mausoleum's three founding families are carved above the entrance: Springbank, Dalmoor, and Everlake.

It takes a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to open the iron gate. Unsealing the stone slab requires a successful DC 20 check.

Loudly opening the iron gate or unsealing the stone slab likely alerts all creatures in the mausoleum as far as area 7.
