## Handout A: Eeyal

eeyal's the name. i've traveled from the snout of omgar to fort beluarian and know the hazards of chult well. i've seen many astounding sights and visited wondrous places in my travels. i carry my own gear, have all the necessary tools for survival, and leave nothing to chance. i don't believe in taking unnecessary risks. my fee is 5 gold pieces per day. i will also accept an up-front, non-refundable payment of 40 gold pieces for a tenday. i strongly recommend that you purchase a charter of exploration at fort beluarian before heading into the jungle. fifty gold pieces is a small price to pay to keep the flaming fist off your backs.

## Handout B: Kwilgok

well met, strangers! i'm kwilgok-once a dinosaur racer, now the best guide in port nyanzaru. i've traveled up the river soshenstar to the aldani basin and back. i've visited so many corners of chult and can tell you: there's no land more beautiful and dangerous. this is my [ankylosaurus](/compendium/bestiary/beast/ankylosaurus.md), deadly treasure. quite a prize, isn't she? follows me everywhere. we cost 6 gold pieces a day, with payment for 30 days up front. very expensive, yes, but worth it, i promise you. may the sun and the moon always watch over you.

## Handout C: Mudgraw

Great Ubtao has led you to me, I see. I am Mudgraw, a legend in these parts. What I lack in youth, I make up for with experience. I've led many expeditions into the evil heart of Chult and seen things that would make you quiver in your shell.

A deadly maze awaits us, brave ones. With Ubtao's blessing, I shall guide you safely through it. That's what I do best! I travel light and wear my home on my back.

I charge 5 gold pieces a day, but there are circumstances under which I might waive my fee. Sometimes the journey through life's maze is reward enough!

## Handout D: Holy Symbol of Umberlee
