_An Adventure for 9th-Level Characters_

The final day of the Shankha Trials unfolds in the city of Sagorpur. But the joy of this most auspicious competition turns to terror as the city's great river swells in a destructive wave—sweeping away both the trials' champion and the sacred trophy. The characters join the effort to rescue those lost and seek out an ancient corruption that has returned.

## Background

Shankhabhumi is a forested swampland where three great city-states thrive on solid ground created by the graces of the riverines, sapient river spirit guardians. Each riverine is the patron spirit of a river, which shares its patron's name. The riverines of the four largest rivers in this land—Iravati, Mehul, Joltara, and the now-lost Adirohit—raised the islands on which the great cities sit. In exchange, the people of Shankhabhumi pay homage to the capricious riverines through the Shankha Trials.

There were originally four cities in Shankhabhumi, but the city of Manivarsha was destroyed during the Shankha Trials five hundred years ago. Manivarsha's patron riverine, Adirohit, vanished, and his river dwindled into dozens of swampy streams. Manivarshi citizens who were away from home were forced to adopt new lives in the other three cities, but the memory of the lost city of Manivarsha remains.

No further catastrophes happened for centuries. But now the conclusion of the most recent Shankha Trials has attracted the attention of a sinister figure from Shankhabhumi's past. This is the ancient, fiend-tainted athlete [Jijibisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jijibisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md), a wicked soul whose desire for eternal honor directly caused the destruction of Manivarsha. Having lived a cursed life as a pride-obsessed fiend in the depths of the swamps for centuries, Jijibisha has recently heard of a rival that threatens to claim her title as the greatest Manivarshi athlete of all time. Her delusions insulted, Jijibisha prepares to use the power of a trapped riverine to claim both the honor and the life of this year's champion.

### Setting the Adventure

Use the following suggestions to help contextualize Shankhabhumi in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters traveling from the Radiant Citadel arrive just outside Sagorpur. If you wish to further detail that region, use the "Shankhabhumi Gazetteer" section at this adventure's end as a departure point.
- **Eberron.** Shankhabhumi could appear as its own island between the continents of Khorvaire and Xen'drik. Alternatively, it could be a hidden nation in Xen'drik, east of Dread Lake.
- **Forgotten Realms.** Shankhabhumi might be found in the jungles south of the Shining Sea, near Chult, or as its own island west of Lantan.

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure:

- **Event Guards.** Judges overseeing the Shankha Trials want to make sure the important event goes smoothly. They hire the characters to serve as bodyguards for visiting athletes.
- **Holy Waters.** The characters or their allies need a magical reagent or blessed water and believe the riverines of Shankhabhumi can provide it. When the characters arrive in Sagorpur, though, the city is swept up in the final days of the Shankha Trials. Members of the local riverine temple will provide these waters only after the upheaval surrounding the trials is ended.

### The Shankha Trials

Characters who come to Shankhabhumi learn the following details about an exciting event called the Shankha Trials:

- The Shankha Trials are a spectacle of art and athleticism. They take their name from shankha shells—the shells of conch mollusks—which feature in Shankhabhumi's legends and are an icon of the land.
- These contests are held over a twelve-day period every twelve years.
- Competitors come from all three of Shankhabhumi's city-states, and they include some folk descended from survivors of the ruined city of Manivarsha.
- Contests include boatbuilding, boat racing, cooking, dancing, shankha diving, and swimming.
- The contests honor the region's riverines, spirits who hold power over the region's many rivers.
- One contestant among three dozen emerges victorious and claims the great conch-shell trophy known as the Riverine's Shankha to grace their home city until the next competition.

## Starting the Adventure

The adventure begins as the characters are in the city of Sagorpur for the end of the competition called the Shankha Trials. Use the "Character Hooks" section to determine why the characters find themselves in the city, and the "Shankhabhumi Gazetteer" section at the end of this adventure to further detail the city. Read or paraphrase the following when you're ready to begin:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The city of Sagorpur is teeming with onlookers enjoying the Shankha Trials. The final event of this great competition is being held next to the temple to the riverine Iravati, an ancient burnt-clay edifice adorned by images of lilies and spirits that peek from behind moss and vines. Countless spectators fill the surrounding streets and line the river.
^2a5

If the characters don't already know the information in "The Shankha Trials" section, now's a perfect time for them to learn it. This might be related by a friendly ally or enthusiastic locals in the crowd.

The crowd has assembled for the final event of the Shankha Trials, where a popular young prodigy—the dancer [Amanisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/amanisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md), called Nisha by her fans—is about to perform. Her name passes through the crowd with a buzz of excitement. The characters have a clear view of her performance. Read the following description for those who watch:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Amanisha's performance is breathtaking, but it carries an edge of sadness. As she dances, an announcer explains that her performance represents the story of the city of Manivarsha's mysterious destruction and of the anguish carried by Nisha and all those Manivarshi who will never return to their ancestral home. As the dance ends, a tumultuous cheer rises from the crowd.
^2a6

A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) or Charisma ([Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check realizes that Nisha's dance was outstanding and captured something meaningful to many people in the crowd. Some viewers wipe the edges of their eyes.

After brief deliberations, the trial judges produce a great conch shell trophy, the Riverine's Shankha. A judge bows, then beckons Nisha forward. Amid cheering and fanfare, she accepts the trophy and takes her place as the newest champion of the Shankha Trials.

## Storm of Destruction

As Nisha raises the Riverine's Shankha above her head and the Shankha Trials conclude, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Thunder rings out as the sky fills with clouds. From the formerly calm river, a surge of water rises, forming a towering wave that flings boats onto the banks. The massive wave crests in a mighty swell crashing toward the crowded shore and riverine temple.
^2a8

The characters have a moment to react to the sudden disaster. The plaza surrounding the riverine temple is thousands of feet long and packed with people. There's little the characters can do to stop the sudden wave, but quick thinking or magic—such as teleporting atop surrounding buildings or a precisely timed [control water](/compendium/spells/control-water.md) spell—might spare the characters and those around them.

When the wave crashes on the plaza, each character must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. Those who fail take 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and are knocked [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone). Those who succeed take half as much damage and aren't knocked [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone). This damage is less in other parts of the great plaza but causes chaos across the open space, smashing vendors' stalls, harming hundreds of people, and leaving behind a foot of standing water that turns the area into "difficult terrain".

### Mass Destruction

The wave has caused utter devastation across the plaza, and hundreds of people rush to escape. Roll on the Wave Chaos table one or more times to see what perils confront the characters.

**Wave Chaos**

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A stall selling mango drinks has collapsed. A character must succeed on a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to free the frantic, trapped vendors. |
| 2 | An overly helpful local insistently tries to get the frailest-looking character to flee with them. |
| 3 | An elder has fallen down. They're bruised and separated from their family. A character must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to find the lost family amid the chaos. |
| 4 | A desperate local searching the ground for the 20 sp they lost in the wave is in danger of being trampled by those fleeing. A character can cause the local to stop searching and move to safety by replacing the lost silver pieces or succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. |
| 5 | Drifting debris smashes into characters on the ground, each of whom must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone). |
| 6 | The wave washes a hostile [swarm of poisonous snakes](/compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-poisonous-snakes.md) into the nearby crowd. |
^wave-chaos

### Chaos at the Temple

After a few rounds of contending with the destruction, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score sees the following scene:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> At the base of the temple, creatures of living water attack people trying to flee.
^2ab

A hostile [water elemental](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) and two [water weirds](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/water-weird.md) with heads shaped like king cobras attack anyone who comes near the temple.

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check realizes the water creatures are defenders of the temple. A character who uses an action and succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces the confused creatures to stand down; the Elementals then dissolve back into the waters within the temple.

#### Survivors at the Temple

Once the temple's guardians are dealt with, several people emerge from within the temple. These are Shankha Trials contestants and judges, including the temple's leader, High Riversinger Plabon Bhatiyali—a 200-year-old, chaotic good, halfling [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md). Many are wounded, but thankfully everyone is alive. However, both [Amanisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/amanisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md) and the Riverine's Shankha trophy are missing. Plabon approaches the characters, and he says:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "The river came for Amanisha and the Riverine's Shankha. The wall of water descended and flowed around us, seeking Amanisha as she tried to help others to safety. It seized her and the trophy, then pulled them both away!"
^2ad

#### The Riversinger's Fears

Plabon is soft-spoken but insists on sharing what he witnessed with the characters. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- Plabon is one of the judges of the Shankha Trials.
- Although riverines hold the power to control river water, Plabon doesn't believe this disaster is the doing of Iravati, the spirit of Sagorpur's river.
- Plabon felt a deep jealousy in the storm and the river. He fears that today's destruction might be linked to the catastrophe that befell the city of Manivarsha.
- Tales of Manivarsha's ruin tell of a sudden storm and a huge wave that rose above the swamp forest, then consumed the city.
- He believes Amanisha is the key to understanding what happened and wants the characters to find her.

Plabon offers the characters 400 gp each if they will find and return Amanisha. If the characters balk, other judges—influential locals and senators of the city—add to the reward, increasing it to 500 gp each in treasures and trade goods, as well as 20 acres of fertile farmland outside the city.

If the characters accept, Plabon admits the task won't be easy; the flooded swamp forests of Shankhabhumi are vast. He encourages the characters to find a boat and a guide who can take them upriver to search for Amanisha.

Before the characters leave, Plabon gives one of them a small shankha shell from the temple. This shell functions as a [stone of good luck](/compendium/items/stone-of-good-luck.md).

## Venturing from Sagorpur

The swamp forests of Shankhabhumi defy attempts to map them. Travelers along the rivers must rely on experienced navigators to guide them. As the characters prepare to head upriver to find Amanisha, they learn many of the city's watercraft were damaged by the disastrous wave. Even if they have their own vessel, they'll still need to hire a navigator for it.

Characters who search along the rivers' edge find the city's river boats in disarray after the disaster. However, as they search, a boat pulls into the harbor. This is the vessel of a skilled majhi—or navigator—named Dukha Majhi Sagorpuri. He has just arrived back in the city.

### Dukha Bhatiyali

[Dukha Bhatiyali](/compendium/bestiary/npc/dukha-bhatiyali-jttrc.md) is an experienced majhi. Although he appears human, his colleagues and passengers don't know he's a [weretiger](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/weretiger.md) (neutral). While several bands of such lycanthropes dwell deep in the swamp forests of Shankhabhumi, Dukha left his tribe and is trying to live as a human. He roams the rivers around Sagorpur in human guise and subjects anyone who accompanies him on his expeditions to endless tales of forest lore.

#### Personality Trait

"I know everything there is to know about the swamp forests!"

#### Ideal

"Outside the cities, the land should be held in harmony between people and the riverines."

#### Bond

"I will protect my people's territory, but I want to live on my own terms."

#### Flaw

"I see danger everywhere."

### Way of the Waters

If the characters seek to hire Dukha, he offers to guide them for 100 gp. A character who haggles and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces him to reduce this price by 25 gp. Once a deal's been made, he shares these details:

- Dukha was traveling toward Sagorpur when the wave struck.
- While approaching, he saw a current of water sparkle with an eerie green light and sweep away from the city. He has seen that same glowing ripple recently along local tributaries of the Iravati River. The first time he saw it was twelve days ago, the first day of the Shankha Trials.
- He followed the glowing ripples, tracing them along a small river called the Tinjhorna.
- Near a series of waterfalls, Tinjhorna the riverine warned Dukha to stay away, accusing mortal folk of unleashing tainted magic upon his waters.
- Dukha can share any of the details in the "Riverine" section at the end of this adventure.

Dukha suggests taking the characters to that same series of waterfalls on the Tinjhorna River in the hope of learning more from the riverine. He has little further information and, at this time, he doesn't share that he's a weretiger.

Dukha's boat is a narrow, flat-bottomed skiff with room for the characters but little else. It moves at a rate of 1½ miles per hour. The majhi is ready to head off whenever the characters please.

### Contacting the Riverine Iravati

The characters might attempt to contact Iravati, the riverine guardian of the river that flows past Sagorpur. The riverine, like the river, is listless and slow to act. No calls or offerings made to Iravati provoke the riverine into appearing.

## The Swamp Forest

Dukha pilots his skiff to the mouth of the Tinjhorna River, a journey that takes 10 hours in his boat. From there, the journey to the waterfalls takes an additional 10 hours. Travel through the swamp forest is smooth until the ship reaches the Tinjhorna River's wilder and narrower waterways. For every 3 hours the characters spend traveling on the Tinjhorna River, or whenever you please, roll on the River Journey Encounters table to see what occurs.

**River Journey Encounters**

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1–2 | It rains heavily. For the next hour, the boat and its surroundings are "heavily obscured". Roll again on this table, ignoring another result of 1 or 2. |
| 3 | The current increases along a narrow stretch of the river. Dukha urgently asks the characters to help row the boat upstream. All of the characters must succeed on a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. The boat loses a half-hour of progress for every failed check or character who doesn't assist. |
| 4 | A mangrove-shaped [treant](/compendium/bestiary/plant/treant.md) blocks the path forward. The treant moves only if the party listens to its hour-long ode to the swamp, or if a character succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to convince it to let the skiff pass. |
| 5 | A [spirit naga](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/spirit-naga.md) appears and asks where the characters are heading. It offers to give a single character its magical treasure, a [pearl of power](/compendium/items/pearl-of-power.md), if that character is brave enough to let it bite them three times. |
| 6 | Six swamp spirits (use the [mud mephit](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/mud-mephit.md) stat block) emerge from the river, demanding that the characters hand over their shiniest valuables. They can be driven off with force or a successful DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check. |
| 7–10 | No encounter |
^river-journey-encounters

### Falls Clearing

As the characters approach the series of waterfalls, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A gradually increasing roar drowns out the rain forest sounds long before the river turns, revealing a series of parallel waterfalls cascading from a ridge that runs alongside the river. A chain of sparsely forested islands lies along the far side of the river opposite the base of the falls.
^2ba

Dukha explains this is where he met the riverine Tinjhorna. He moors the boat amid the islands opposite the falls so the group can attempt to call upon the riverine—and to keep it safe in case the spirit proves hostile.

As Dukha ties up the boat, characters who succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notice several pairs of green, feline eyes watching from amid the island's foliage. Upon being noticed or soon after the characters land on the island, three hostile [weretigers](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/weretiger.md) in hybrid form emerge with longbows drawn. They gauge the party's intentions for 1 round before attacking. A character who talks to the weretigers during this round can convince them not to attack by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Even if the weretigers do attack, a character who spends an action can attempt this check, convincing the weretigers to stand down if they're successful. All the weretigers flee from combat when any of them are reduced to 10 hit points or fewer.

#### Dukha's Role

Dukha tries to stay out of this conflict, but he doesn't want to see his fellow weretigers harmed. If the weretigers attack, Dukha shouts for the lycanthropes to fall back, telling them the characters come in peace. If the fight lasts more than 2 rounds, Dukha shifts into his hybrid form and fights alongside the characters until the other weretigers are driven off. If he does so, he resents the characters' lack of diplomacy and does not aid them in future battles. However, if he doesn't have to, he appreciates the characters' respect for the creatures of the forest and aids the party in any future conflicts where they need aid.

#### Tiger Talk

If the characters converse with the weretigers, or if they run the weretigers off and then question Dukha, it becomes clear that Dukha and the weretigers are familiar with each other. Dukha or the weretigers share the following information:

- This area is the weretigers' territory, and they have noticed unnatural changes to the flow of the river.
- The weretigers think that the people of Sagorpur have caused the disturbance.
- They seek to protect their territory from anyone who would harm it or the riverine Tinjhorna.
- The weretigers haven't seen the riverine Tinjhorna since he confronted Dukha, but the riverine often frequents the pool atop the falls.
- If he hasn't already, Dukha reveals he is a lycanthrope and was raised among the weretigers who dwell in the forest.

After conversing with the characters, the weretigers encourage the party not to linger in their territory; then they depart. Dukha makes no apologies for hiding his true nature and encourages the characters to continue their search for the riverine Tinjhorna atop the falls.

### Headwater Pool

From where Dukha moors his boat, the characters can follow an indirect but mostly dry path to the cliffs the parallel waterfalls cascade down. Climbing the slippery, 20-foot-tall rock face around the waterfalls requires a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Those who fail the check fall 10 feet into the water. If more than one character falls, a [swarm of quippers](/compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-quippers.md) takes notice and attacks.

When the first character reaches the top of the waterfalls, the following scene unfolds before them:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The adjacent waterfalls are fed by a broad, shallow pool surrounded by ancient mangrove trees. Twenty feet away, a young man with green skin walks atop the water, speaking softly while slowly circling two churning pillars of glowing green foam.
^2bf

Tinjhorna the [riverine](/compendium/bestiary/fey/riverine-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) is speaking in Aquan and trying to calm a pair of [water elementals](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) corrupted by the strange magic afflicting his river.

Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognize the frothing pillars as water elementals. Characters risk provoking the Elementals if they're noisy or approach without caution. Characters who approach carefully and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to calm the creatures aid Tinjhorna in pacifying the Elementals, and a moment later, the creatures vanish. If the characters are aggressive, the water elementals are startled and attack.

The pool is 4 feet deep and is "difficult terrain".

#### Speaking with Tinjhorna

Tinjhorna is a youthful, neutral riverine who appears as a soft-spoken young man with long hair. His river was one of many waterways created in the geological fallout after the destruction of the city of Manivarsha and the great river Adirohit. Although he dreams of one day being a mighty river, his dream is imperiled by the strange magic infecting his waters.

Tinjhorna thanks the characters for their help and eagerly converses with them. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- A week or so ago, Tinjhorna felt an ancient power affecting his river, as if something were moving through the waters to the southwest.
- There's little in that direction except for a haunted area called the Forest of Hands.
- The Forest of Hands occupies much of the same land as the vanished Adirohit River and the disappeared city of Manivarsha.
- The magic Tinjhorna felt has angered many inhabitants of the surrounding swamp forest. He has his hands full trying to calm them.
- Tinjhorna has seen no evidence of the lost dancer Amanisha, but he asks the characters to seek out the source of the magic affecting his river.

If the characters agree to help the riverine, he thanks them and gives them a [potion of healing (superior)](/compendium/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md). The riverine offers to watch over the characters if they wish to rest near the falls but won't travel with them, as he must attend to the disturbed creatures along his river's length.

## Forest of Hands

From the waterfalls, the journey to the Forest of Hands takes 10 hours. Dukha continues to serve as the characters' navigator, regardless of the events at the waterfall. For every 3 hours the characters spend traveling on the Tinjhorna River, or whenever you please, roll on the River Journey Encounters table in "The Swamp Forest" section.

When the characters reach the Forest of Hands, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The scent of the swamp takes on the sweet stink of rotting flesh. Trees with drooping limbs stand amid the river, their branches like hundreds of gray hands and their dangling leaves like long, leathery fingers.
^2c2

Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History) or [Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check recognize the region's notorious angul trees, plants that stink of rotting flesh and drip crimson sap. The trees are harmless, but many travelers find the long, finger-like leaves gliding over them as they pass beneath more than a little disconcerting.

The journey through the Forest of Hands lasts 3 hours. Roll for or choose an encounter from the Forest of Hands Encounters table after every hour of travel.

**Forest of Hands Encounters**

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Three clots of animate angul tree sap (use the [black pudding](/compendium/bestiary/ooze/black-pudding.md) stat block) attack from underwater. |
| 2 | Spectral boats appear through the trees. Dukha or a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check knows these phantoms are travelers who were lost when Manivarsha was ruined. The spirits are unnerving but harmless. |
| 3 | Fog rises and "lightly obscures" the forest. Through it, two [will-o-wisps](/compendium/bestiary/undead/will-o-wisp.md) try to lead the characters into the path of a hostile [hydra](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/hydra.md). |
| 4 | A [fomorian](/compendium/bestiary/giant/fomorian.md) hermit blocks the boat's passage. It demands the characters cook a meal for it, or it will eat them. It likes only disgusting food. |
^forest-of-hands-encounters

### Forest Heart

Pushing through the Forest of Hands eventually brings the characters to a clearing at the forest's heart. This area is depicted on map 9.1. Read the following description when the characters arrive:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Several slow-moving waterways convene at a rocky island covered in moss and ruined stones. Atop it stands the blackened, rotting stump of a great tree. On the stump, [Amanisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/amanisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md) lies motionless.
^2c4

The water in this area is 10 feet deep (see the "Player's Handbook" for details on "swimming"). The island rises gently to the north and south, while on its east and west sides, 10-foot-high bluffs rise from the river. Characters who succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notice the island's rocks look like pieces of an ancient structure.

Amanisha (neutral good, human [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)) is [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious). She currently has no weapons and 5 hit points. Magical healing or a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check restores her to consciousness. Characters who look for her trophy from the Shankha Trials, the Riverine's Shankha, don't see it.

#### Amanisha Manivarshi

[Amanisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/amanisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md) is an accomplished dancer and the most recent champion of the Shankha Trials. Known as Nisha to her friends and fans, she is a charming young woman whose Manivarshi ancestors settled in Tippurika after their home disappeared. Nisha uses the last name "Manivarshi" out of respect for her family and heritage.

##### Personality Trait

"Many see my focus and assume I'm not approachable. But I welcome new friends."

##### Ideal

"I will make the city of my birth and descendants of Manivarsha proud by bringing home the Riverine's Shankha."

##### Bond

"The folk of the Manivarshi diaspora cling too much to memories. I will give them something new to celebrate."

##### Flaw

"I am both a child of Tippurika and a descendant of Manivarsha. I am quick to hold a grudge against those who tell me I have to be one or the other."

#### Prisoner of the Past

Nisha awakens in a fog, confused and disoriented. She calms down if the characters assure her that they've come to help. Nisha shares the following information:

- The wave that smashed Sagorpur seized Nisha and the Riverine's Shankha, then dragged them here.
- Once here, Nisha was attacked by a monstrous woman with gray skin that oozes crimson ichor, like the surrounding forest's angul trees. The fiend seized the Riverine's Shankha, declaring it belonged to her.
- The fiend claimed this place marks the edge of the ruins of lost Manivarsha.
- The fiend said that if Nisha thinks she's Manivarshi, then she can be a prisoner here for the rest of her days.

### Jijibisha's Vengeance

[Jijibisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jijibisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md), a vicious soul from the land's past, lurks in the nearby forest. Long ago she made a deal with wicked otherworldly forces that gave her longevity and fiendish powers, a bargain that ultimately resulted in the ruin of Manivarsha. She is behind Amanisha's capture and is loath to let her prisoner escape.

Before the party can complete their conversation with Amanisha, the effects of Jijibisha's [wall of fire](/compendium/spells/wall-of-fire.md) spell spring up, separating as many characters from their boat as possible. Read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A woman with tattered, ancient robes and skin the color of a drowned corpse walks out of swamp at the south edge of the island.
> 
> "Welcome, visitors! I am [Jijibisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jijibisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md)—I'm sure you've heard of me. I know you've come to steal my trophy," the woman says, holding up the Riverine's Shankha. "But I am the last champion of Manivarshi to win the Riverine's Shankha—not this upstart. It cost me everything, but my victory is eternal!"
^2cc

[Jijibisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jijibisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md) uses the [ultroloth](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/ultroloth.md) stat block, but she has access to only the [wall of fire](/compendium/spells/wall-of-fire.md) spell and the at-will spells from her Innate Spellcasting trait. Despite her fiendish powers, she looks like an ancient, withered human.

After she finishes speaking, Jijibisha attacks. She attempts to use her Hypnotic Gaze to turn Dukha and Amanisha against the characters. While she fights, Jijibisha mocks the characters, claiming to be the last champion of Manivarsha and the only Manivarshi who can rightfully claim the Riverine's Shankha. If Jijibisha is separated from the Riverine's Shankha, she has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until she regains it. She fights to the death.

A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check has heard of [Jijibisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jijibisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md) and can confirm that she was favored to win the Shankha Trials the year Manivarsha was destroyed.

### Adirohit's Retribution

When [Jijibisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jijibisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md) is destroyed, all is silent for a moment before a voice drifts from beneath the tree stump at the center of the Forest Heart.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "You out there!" calls a voice from beneath the tree stump. "Has that horror been banished? Is she finally gone? Set things right. Set me free!"
^2ce

If the characters respond to the voice, the speaker shares the following information:

- The voice says he is Adirohit, the riverine of the lost Adirohit River, which once nourished the great city of Manivarsha.
- Adirohit has been locked away for hundreds of years beneath a mighty mangrove that once adorned a temple built in his honor—ever since the Shankha Trials that precipitated the destruction of Manivarsha.
- Jijibisha trapped him here using her fiendish power and forced him to cause the flood in Sagorpur.
- Now that Jijibisha is gone, touching any blessed shankha to the tree stump will release him.

Using either the Riverine's Shankha or the magical shankha Plabon gifted the characters releases Adirohit. However, Amanisha urges the characters to consider cautiously.

Through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, a character can convince Adirohit to reveal the following details:

- Long ago, [Jijibisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jijibisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md) made a deal with a wicked god to give her fiendish powers that would ensure her victory in the Shankha Trials.
- Adirohit was outraged that humans would pervert the sacred trials and unleashed a flood to punish the whole city by sinking it into the swamp.
- [Jijibisha Manivarshi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jijibisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md) survived, though, and declared herself winner of the trials.
- Jijibisha used her sinister powers to bind Adirohit within his ruined temple.
- Jijibisha was delighted that she would be the last Manivarshi to ever win the Shankha Trials—at least, until Amanisha's victory.

While Adirohit is a captive now and has been used by Jijibisha, he was not when he sank Manivarsha.

It's up to the characters to determine whether or not they free Adirohit. Amanisha has complex feelings about this, seeing Adirohit as a tie to her ancient people and one who could restore a measure of what was lost, but also a tempestuous being who destroyed her ancestors. She will not impede the characters no matter what choice they make.

#### Adirohit's Fate

If the characters free Adirohit, he emerges from the stump in a torrent of river water. He is an arrogant, chaotic neutral [riverine](/compendium/bestiary/fey/riverine-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) who looks like a muscular, middle-aged man with white hair and blue skin. He thanks the characters for their service and brings forth treasure to reward them with (see the following section). Adirohit is unapologetic for his past deeds, even if Amanisha or others ask him to explain Manivarsha's fate. He's confident, though, that he can reestablish his river and that soon enough humans will build a new, greater city on its banks. He invites the characters to rest here under his protection and tell him how the world has changed. Amanisha has no interest in doing this, though—what Adirohit did to Manivarsha fills her with anger. Feel free to roleplaying the contentious dynamic between Amanisha and Adirohit, or encourage the characters to choose sides, as much as you please.

Ultimately, the riverine allows the characters to leave whenever they like but insists on rewarding them for freeing him before they do.

#### Treasure

Using his magic, Adirohit causes the following treasures to rise upon a geyser from the ruins beneath the island, bequeathing them upon the characters:

- A fist-sized sapphire worth 6,000 gp
- An [emerald elemental gem](/compendium/items/elemental-gem-emerald.md) that conjures a [water elemental](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) that resembles Adirohit
- An intricately carved jade statuette depicting a muscular version of Adirohit, worth 500 gp
- A waterproof sack containing a length of the finest silk bastra, embroidered with pearls worth 250 gp

## Conclusion

The journey back to the Tinjhorna River is uneventful. The riverine Tinjhorna is enthusiastic to hear about the characters' journey and thanks them for investigating. When the characters return to Sagorpur with Amanisha and the Riverine's Shankha, they receive a hero's welcome, along with the rewards Plabon and the other trial judges promised. Depending on Adirohit's fate, only time will tell how the riverine could change the waters of the swamp forest or whether he is lost forever.

## Shankhabhumi Gazetteer

Shaped and defined by its rivers, Shankhabhumi is a dynamic floodplain surrounded by mountains and crisscrossed by waterways. Most of the land is covered in swamp forests infested with unknown perils, except for three city-states that stand proudly on broad islands of miraculously dry land. The islands on which the cities of Ashwadhatu, Sagorpur, and Tippurika stand were each granted to the people by a different riverine, and at the heart of each city is a temple dedicated to that city's patron riverine. A fourth city, Manivarsha, was destroyed in a cataclysm five hundred years ago.

Each city spreads out in concentric circles from its riverine temple. The innermost circle holds the city's senate house, main market, and academy, as well as the houses of wealthy citizens. Past these lie modest residential neighborhoods and trade wards. At its edges, each city slopes down to submerged rice fields before dissipating into the swamps. The skies of Shankhabhumi are eternally heavy with rainclouds, and even well-maintained buildings wear a fine coat of moss.

To experience Shankhabhumi at its finest, one must visit during the Shankha Trials, held every twelve years in one of the three cities. A twelve-day spectacle of skill and might, the trials feature contestants representing each city who entertain thousands of spectators. But the trials are more than a competition; they represent the origin story of the land and a pact endlessly renewed between the people and the riverines to whom the land belongs.

### Features

Those familiar with Shankhabhumi know the following details:

- **Hallmarks.** This region is known for its isolated city-states separated by tangled swamps, and for the capricious river spirits that rule its waters.
- **People.** Urban society is a mix of humans, halflings, elves, and dwarves. Skin tones in Shankhabhumi span shades of brown, and people have uniformly dark hair that ranges from wavy to very curly.
- **Languages.** The folk of Shankhabhumi speak Common and Shankhi, the regional tongue.

### Noteworthy Sites

Hundreds of rivers flow through Shankhabhumi, creating natural paths to its three great cities.

#### Ashwadhatu

The Mehul River flows from the Nirjhar Highlands, through Ashwadhatu, and on to Dishahara Bay. The city of Shankhabhumi with the largest area of solid land, Ashwadhatu has long been the home of proud, traditionalist farmers, miners, and boatbuilders. More recently, metalworkers and inventors are fueling a growing industry, though some citizens dismiss them as eccentrics creating unnecessary, newfangled contrivances.

#### Sagorpur

Sagorpur is the mightiest city of Shankhabhumi, having inherited that mantle when Manivarsha was ruined five centuries ago. The city lies where the Iravati River flows into Dishahara Bay, and its mainstay is sea trade. A wide array of goods can be purchased in the city's sprawling markets, and seafaring foreigners and inland travelers from Tippurika and Ashwadhatu mingle with locals in Sagorpur's numerous inns, playhouses, gambling dens, and restaurants.

#### Tippurika

The city of Tippurika stands where the Joltara River flows from the Adhameru Mountains into a deep canyon, frothing with whitewater rapids. Tippuri citizens—a majority of them dwarves and halflings—are adept at climbing steep paths, traversing unstable rope bridges, fishing in mountain rapids, and exploring the inaccessible caves of the mountains. The city is known for its hill crops—particularly tea and timber. Locals take pride in their staunch courage and infuriating stubbornness in equal measure.

### Life in Shankhabhumi

Outsiders often refer to the people of Shankhabhumi collectively as "riverlanders," but the folk of the three city-states call themselves Sagorpuri, Ashwadhatuj, or Tippuri, and claim to have little in common with one another. However, that's an exaggeration; the people of Shankhabhumi share unifying traits and experiences.

#### Clothing and Accoutrements

The folk of Shankhabhumi favor clothing composed of lengths of cotton or silk cloth called bastras, which are wrapped around the body in various styles. These include the loose, voluminous drapes of a sedentary noble, the tight, ropelike wrap of a Shankha Trials contestant, and the practical, gathered garments of a laborer or river navigator.

Wavy or curly hair is common in the region; people rub it to a shine with coconut oil and wear it long or in thick plaits. Ornaments include conch-shell bangles and hairpieces, as well as designs of white clay painted directly onto the skin. Gold and gemstone jewelry, a specialty of the ruined city of Manivarsha, is popular among wealthy citizens and often crafted by the descendants of artisans from the Manivarshi diaspora.

#### Manivarshi Diaspora

The city-state of Manivarsha was destroyed five hundred years ago under circumstances that have never fully been explained. On the last day of that year's Shankha Trials, the city simply vanished, along with everyone there. A few survivors who were just outside the city at the time told of a towering wave along the Adirohit River that marked its demise; subsequent attempts to reach its former location found nothing but endless swamps. Citizens who were away from home were left stranded. Those survivors and their descendants assimilated into the other cities, bringing Manivarsha's traditions of gem-cutting and jewel-setting to their new homes. This jewelry is now common throughout the land, and many pieces are fantastically valuable.

#### Power and Politics

Aside from their cultural rivalries, Sagorpur, Tippurika and Ashwadhatu rarely engage in major conflicts—living in a land that constantly changes with the caprices of the riverines is precarious enough. The shadow of the lost city of Manivarsha hangs over the remaining cities as a reminder that life in Shankhabhumi can easily be swept away.

Power in each city is shared between three factions—fifteen senators who officially govern the affairs of the city-state; a network of river-navigator majhis known as the Bhatiyali; and former Shankha Trials contestants who become famous public entertainers and heroes, if they don't become senators themselves.

#### River Bounty

Every meal in Shankhabhumi includes fish, though each city proclaims its own style of preparing it to be the best. In fact, cooking is a competitive discipline at the Shankha Trials. Sagorpuri fish curries are fragrant with spices imported from foreign lands, while Ashwadhatuj cook their fish with locally farmed vegetables, and Tippuris ferment their mountain fish in tea.

#### Sign of the Shankha

The shell of the conch mollusk, known locally as a shankha, is the eponymous icon of Shankhabhumi. The sizable Riverine's Shankha is the legendary shell trophy that circulates among the cities via the Shankha Trials, kept at the riverine temple in the current champion's city until that city hosts the next trials. Smaller shankhas are rare and precious, and they are often worn like pendants by those who can afford them. Shankha motifs decorate all riverine temples and adorn weaving, white-clay body art, jewelry, children's toys, pastries, and more.

#### Names

The given names of people in Shankhabhumi tend to be many syllables long and indicate the bearer's gender. Most folk use a last name based on their city of birth—Sagorpuri, Ashwadhatuj or Tippuri. The only exceptions are the descendants of Manivarsha (many of whom still use "Manivarshi") and majhis who take the last name "Bhatiyali." The following are common names in Shankhabhumi:

- **Feminine.** Amrapali, Bhanumati, Jamdani, Phullora
- **Masculine.** Anuttom, Chakrayudh, Rudrashekhar, Udayaditya
- **Gender-Neutral.** Kheya, Kobi, Palki, Ulka

### Legends of Shankhabhumi

The ancestors of the people of Shankhabhumi migrated here from other lands about a thousand years ago. They arrived to find swamp forests infested with monsters and other dangers—a land shaped by hundreds of riverines who were indifferent to the newcomers and their fates. Then the elven leader Kubjhatika killed a giant mollusk that attacked her people. After the battle, she carved the tale of her victory and her people's journey on a beautiful, red-ridged shell. This shell became the Riverine's Shankha. Kubjhatika offered it as tribute to the riverines, appealing to them for refuge amid the unforgiving land.

The four greatest riverines—Adirohit, Iravati, Mehul, and Joltara—each wished to claim the Riverine's Shankha as their own. Kubjhatika proposed the Shankha Trials to ensure it would circulate fairly. But since people who could barely survive in this unstable land couldn't put on such a spectacular event, Kubjhatika persuaded the riverines to each create a site for a great city. Thus, the riverines created the stable islands on which Manivarsha, Sagorpur, Ashwadhatu, and Tippurika would be built, and the histories of those great cities began.

### Characters from Shankhabhumi

If players create characters from Shankhabhumi, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**Which city do you come from?** Were you raised in cosmopolitan Sagorpur, traditionalist Ashwadhatu, or hardy Tippurika?

**Are you looking forward to the next Shankha Trials**? Are the trials the best part of living in Shankhabhumi for you, or just a spectacular nuisance every twelve years? Have you participated in past trials?

**Have you ever encountered a riverine?** Did the unpredictable spirit harm you or bless you in some way? Have you seen the riverine since then? Do you now have a deeper connection to it?

## Riverine

More than mere waterway guardians, riverines are embodiments of particular rivers. These spirits of nature take shape to defend their waters and interact with those who travel along their currents. From the waist up, riverines have skin the color of the waters they protect but are otherwise humanlike in appearance. From the waist down, they can manifest either humanlike legs or churning gouts of water. A riverine's personality reflects the nature of the river it arises from—some are lethargic while others are wild and reckless.

### A Riverine's Lair

Some riverines enjoy reverence akin to worship. Their likenesses are cast as statues and housed in temples, and worshipers act as agents between the river spirits and the people who revere them. These temples often become the home of the riverine itself, serving as its lair, though other nexuses of power along the river's path—such as its source or a significant waterfall—can also be used as lairs by a riverine.

A riverine encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP).

#### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the riverine can take one of the following lair actions; the riverine can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Phantasmal Mist.** The riverine creates fog around a creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (1d10) psychic damage and be [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the riverine until the end of the target's next turn.
- **River's Fury.** The riverine conjures swampy ground that briefly covers the ground in a 20-foot square the riverine can see within 120 feet of itself. That area becomes "difficult terrain" until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature, other than the riverine, that enters the affected area or starts its turn there takes 7 (2d6) cold damage.

#### Regional Effects

The region containing a riverine's lair flourishes under the magic of the riverine's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Clearwater Sight.** The waters of the river serve as a conduit for the riverine's consciousness. As an action, the riverine can cast the [clairvoyance](/compendium/spells/clairvoyance.md) spell, requiring no spell components, targeting any point along the river it's connected to.
- **River's Bounty.** Freshwater fauna and flora reproduce rapidly and thrive in the waters within 1 mile of the riverine's lair. Foraging in these waters yields twice the usual amount of food.
- **Spirit Guidance.** Tracks appear along the banks of the river within 6 miles of the riverine's lair. The tracks lead to potential shelters and safe passages across the river's waters, while also leading away from areas that the riverine prefers to remain undisturbed.

If the riverine dies, the flora and fauna return to normal levels, and its river dries out over the course of 1d10 days. All other effects cease immediately.
