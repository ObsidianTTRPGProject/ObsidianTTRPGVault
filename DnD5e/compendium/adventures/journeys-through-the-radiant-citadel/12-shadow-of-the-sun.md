_An Adventure for 11th-Level Characters_

On the eve of a triennial lunar festival, a monster attack brings the characters to the attention of the Brightguard, holy enforcers in the city-state of Akharin Sangar. The characters are asked to act as an angel's agents and discover rebel plots before innocent blood is spilled. But soon the characters learn that in Akharin Sangar, nothing is as plain as day or night.

## Background

For about one week every three years, a mysterious lunar phenomenon bathes Akharin Sangar with light in the dead of night. Ancient magic causes the moon to blaze like the sun for a short while. Sangarians call this phenomenon Shabe Taabaan, or "Brilliant Night," and celebrate it with a multiday festival commemorating light's triumph over darkness. [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md), an angel who has ruled Akharin Sangar since he delivered it from catastrophe fifty years ago, suspends the city-state's nightly curfew in honor of the holiday. This year, however, celebrations are muted.

Recently, anarchists called the Ashen Heirs have tormented the city with propaganda and violence, seeking to incite rebellion against [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md). The Brightguard struggles to maintain law amid the havoc. Stretched thin, the order detains suspected resistance members and issues citations. This makes hiding in plain sight difficult for members of a more peaceable resistance group, the Silent Roar, that hopes to restore Sangarian society to its former glory.

### Setting the Adventure

Use the following suggestions to help contextualize Akharin Sangar in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters traveling from the Radiant Citadel arrive just outside Akharin Sangar. If you wish to further detail this land, use the "Akharin Sangar Gazetteer" section at this adventure's end as a departure point.
- **Forgotten Realms.** Akharin Sangar fits in well along any edge of the Calim Desert in Calimshan.
- **Greyhawk.** The western edge of the Barrier Peaks and the Crystalmist Mountains hold many isolated, arid regions where Akharin Sangar might exist. Isolated reaches of the Bright Desert also make logical locations for the city-state.

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure:

- **Friends of Afsoun.** A character knows the famed actor [Afsoun Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/afsoun-ghorbani-jttrc.md), head of the Silent Roar, or is connected to her via an acquaintance. She invites the characters to Akharin Sangar to help protect her people during Shabe Taabaan.
- **Impartial Guardians.** [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) or a ranking member of the Brightguard invites outsiders to Akharin Sangar to supplement the city's guard during the festival. The group in power trusts that competent adventurers from outside the city will have no connection to the local revolutionary factions.
- **Midnight Sun.** An ally of the characters has received permission to visit Akharin Sangar and witness a periodic event in which the moon shines like the sun. This ally asks the characters to escort them on a scholarly or religious expedition.

### Splitting Loyalties

During the adventure, characters will ally with one of two factions: the Brightguard or the Silent Roar. The Brightguard approaches them first, but characters might change their loyalties. How the characters manage relationships with these factions affects how the adventure unfolds.

#### Brightguard

Before [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md), the Brightguard was a fringe collective of devout protectors who vowed to defend Akharin Sangar from evil in the name of their deity, the Sunweaver. When the angel [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)—an agent of the Sunweaver—deemed service in the Brightguard a holy calling, the group's ranks swelled. Most members have unshakable resolve, but recent revolutionary acts have the order on edge. The Brightguard obeys [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) and, through him, the Sunweaver (see the "Akharin Sangar Gazetteer" section for details).

##### Motto

"All good acts take place under the sun."

##### Beliefs

The Sunweaver sets my path.

##### Goals

Maintain order under the enlightened direction of [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md).

##### Character Role

Characters who align with the Brightguard find the group earnestly seeks to enforce Akharin Sangar's laws and keep the city-state peaceful and pristine. At the behest of the group, the characters investigate the activities of the Ashen Heirs and come into contact with the Silent Roar.

#### Silent Roar

Members of the Silent Roar seek to return [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) to the Sunweaver and restore Akharin Sangar to a state of self-rule. Named for the lions that roam the lands beyond the city, the faction is secretly led by famed actor [Afsoun Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/afsoun-ghorbani-jttrc.md), and its agents are largely chaotic good artisans, philosophers, and merchants who have suffered under [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s isolationist policies. Silent Roar agents are usually patient and nonviolent, but they defend the order and its members like lions protect their prides. They resent other revolutionary groups whose violent ways cause the people to distrust the Silent Roar by extension. Many Silent Roar members romanticize Akharin Sangar's past even as they acknowledge that the city-state has faced dire problems and might not have survived without [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s intervention.

##### Motto

"Protect the pride, preserve the city."

##### Beliefs

[Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) has cost this once-great city-state its splendor.

##### Goals

Remove [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) and remake the city.

##### Character Role

After the Brightguard initially sets the characters on the path to track down disruptive anarchists, Afsoun's sister, [Laleh Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laleh-ghorbani-jttrc.md), approaches the characters for aid. Characters who align themselves with the Silent Roar end up opposing Artavazda, an angel prominent in the Brightguard, as they try to free Afsoun.

## Starting the Adventure

The adventure begins once the characters arrive in Akharin Sangar. The city is filled with locals anticipating the festival of Shabe Taabaan. Whether the characters seek accommodations, opportunities to shop, or a glimpse of the festivities, they soon find themselves in Three Sun Square. Once the characters arrive, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Hundreds of people flock to Three Sun Square in advance of Shabe Taabaan, the Brilliant Night. The crowded plaza is filled with colorful stalls and vendors hawking toys and keepsakes. Booths selling steaming rice, tangy stews, and sun-shaped desserts fill the air with delectable fragrances. Nearby, members of the Brightguard—Akharin Sangar's holy order of protectors—patrol the arched balconies of their headquarters, the Noble Jewel, and scan the crowd for trouble.
^349

Give the characters the opportunity to explore the square. The people of Akharin Sangar are largely friendly and curious about outsiders. A passing member of the Brightguard might even introduce their order to the characters and ask the party to seek out the Brightguard if they ever need aid.

Once the characters have interacted with a few of the city's people, proceed with the following section.

### Anarchist Outcry

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An ear-splitting crash pierces the air. Five figures wearing snarling, crimson masks clamber atop stalls, each raising a cone-like device to their mouth. Along with an irritating buzzing noise, the masked figures' voices emanate from the contraptions, amplified over the cacophony of the crowd: "Down with tyrants! Let the embers light the way!"
^34b

Five masked anarchists (use the [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) stat block), members of a group called the Ashen Heirs, have interrupted the festivities to antagonize the Brightguard. As they do so, their attempts to stand atop stalls cause booths and tents to collapse, disrupting trade and imperiling vendors.

Each anarchist wears an intimidating mask sculpted to look like an efreeti and carries a device called a boomhailer. These sound-amplifying, clockwork funnels have the following properties:

- Any creature that speaks into the small end of a boomhailer has its voice amplified to be three times louder than normal.
- Poorly made devices, boomhailers function for 10 rounds before breaking.
- A boomhailer emits an irritating buzzing noise whenever it's used and for a minute afterward. The noise is harmless, but creatures sensitive to vibrations find it infuriating.
- A boomhailer is a Tiny object with AC 13, hp 5, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

The Ashen Heirs decry the Brightguard as oppressive brutes masquerading as pious saints. While some onlookers may agree, no one is fool enough to draw attention to themself by openly supporting either side. While the speaker shouts, five members of the Brightguard (use the [guard](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) stat block) move toward the Ashen Heirs—one toward each anarchist—trying to make sure they don't hurt themselves or anyone else with their dramatics.

> [!quote] Timing Shabe Taabaan
> 
> Shabe Taabaan is meant to serve as a backdrop to the final encounter of this adventure. How many nights the moon glows like the sun over Akharin Sangar is left purposefully vague so you don't need to rush the climax to occur on a specific night.
^timing-shabe-taabaan

#### Caught in the Middle

The characters might decide to get involved in the conflict, perhaps by trying to subdue the Ashen Heirs or convincing them to run before they're arrested. In any case, harming a member of the Brightguard is a serious offense, a fact nearby locals warn the characters of if they draw their weapons.

The characters might also choose to avoid getting involved, as do most of the folk around them. If they don't act, new strife will involve them imminently.

#### Sensing Tremors

During the conflict, the Ashen Heirs continue decrying the Brightguard with calls of "Cast off your fetters!" and "Mortal life, mortal rule!" Regardless of whether the characters get involved, a character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check feels an intensifying vibration beneath their feet. A character who succeeds on a subsequent DC 14 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check realizes something is burrowing under the square.

### Purple Worm Attack

As the altercation between the Ashen Heirs and the Brightguard comes to a head, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Stone cracks and people scream as a massive, spiked worm erupts from the center of the square, catapulting booths and handcarts into the air. The monstrosity roars, spraying the scattering crowd with fist-sized globs of spittle. Guards shout for reinforcements.
^350

The combination of noises from the large crowd and the disruptive vibrations of the boomhailers has enraged a [purple worm](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) dwelling deep below the city. It emerges and begins wreaking havoc on Three Sun Square, targeting the Ashen Heirs' boomhailers. When the Ashen Heirs see the worm racing toward them, they attempt to flee. The purple worm is irritated by the sound from the boomhailers and continues to attack until it devours the devices (and likely the Ashen Heirs holding them) or it is slain.

Map 11.1 depicts the area as the purple worm emerges. Stars mark the locations of Ashen Heirs. The fleeing crowd and scattered debris make the entire square "difficult terrain".

#### Dealing with the Boomhailers

The purple worm thrashes its head as it rampages through the square. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check realizes the Ashen Heirs' devices are irritating the creature. Unaware of this, the Ashen Heirs cling to their buzzing boomhailers as they flee. A character who spends an action alerting an anarchist to the risk and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces that anarchist to drop their device. The purple worm ignores creatures that don't have a boomhailer and that don't threaten it. If all five boomhailers are destroyed, the purple worm retreats down the hole it created in the center of the square.

#### Guards

The guards who were trying to capture the Ashen Heirs shift to helping locals escape as soon as the purple worm appears. At the start of the fifth round, the angel Artavazda (a lawful good [pari](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/pari-jttrc.md); detailed at the end of this adventure) appears at the southeastern corner of the square with ten members of the Brightguard (use the [guard](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) stat block). If the purple worm is still alive, Artavazda rapidly moves to slay it. If the characters defeat the purple worm before this, Artavazda arrives just as they do so.

### Angels in the Aftermath

After the purple worm is dispatched, the pari Artavazda introduces themself:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A blue-skinned angel with four scarlet wings lands before you, accompanied by a gentle breeze. The angel wears a pointed, shimmering helmet and wields a flanged mace reminiscent of a blazing sun. "I am Artavazda," the angel announces, "harbinger of the Brightguard and [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s righteous hand."
^354

Artavazda saw how the characters distinguished themselves and offers to heal an injured character. The angel can answer questions about the Ashen Heirs, the Brightguard, or [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) (all are detailed in the "Akharin Sangar Gazetteer" section at the end of the adventure). If asked about the purple worm, Artavazda tells the characters such creatures are rare, calling the attack "a calamity incited by reckless souls." The angel converses with the characters for a moment before offering them a proposition.

#### Artavazda

When [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) came to Akharin Sangar, he was accompanied by a host of angels, the pari Artavazda among them. Artavazda has four narrow wings whose gradually shifting colors are reminiscent of a sunset. The pari's smooth, curly black hair is mostly hidden beneath a pointed gold helmet that frames a calm, pale-blue face and glowing eyes.

Artavazda embodies the Sunweaver in word and deed. Though Artavazda holds lawbreakers accountable for their crimes, the pari is a staunch believer in rehabilitation and leads a voluntary gardening program for those serving time, cultivating goodness in folk who have lost their way.

##### Personality Trait

"There is light in every soul. I am keen to purge the darkness that shrouds it."

##### Ideal

"Good and evil are as plain as day and night."

##### Bond

"It is my duty to protect Akharin Sangar according to [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s law."

##### Flaw

"I am incapable of telling a lie. Truth doesn't hide in darkness."

#### Artavazda's Request

Artavazda explains that in the lead-up to Shabe Taabaan, the Brightguard has seen many disruptions. The angel asks the characters to work with the Brightguard until the festival ends a few days from now, protecting the people from dramatic displays that turn dangerous. Artavazda goes on to explain the following points:

- Though the angels who serve [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) are powerful, they are too few to support the Brightguard's rank-and-file members during times of trouble. With tensions between the Brightguard and rebel groups running high, Artavazda seeks assistance.
- Too often, rebels and Brightguard members are harmed during altercations. Artavazda wants those who oppose [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s rule to have the opportunity to learn the error of their ways peaceably.
- The angel believes adventurers can be more creative—and more liberal with the truth—than the Brightguard, enabling such characters to learn more about rebels and prevent dangerous situations in ways the Brightguard can't.
- Artavazda offers each character 800 gp for their aid, plus the potential for additional work.

If the characters balk at working with the Brightguard, Artavazda doubles his payment offer. Should the characters still refuse, the pari understands but requests they visit the Ruz Bazaar to see the pain the Ashen Heirs are causing. Continue with "Afsoun's Arrest" but then skip the "Artavazda's Mission" section and move on to the "Ruz Bazaar" section. There, have agents of the Brightguard or Silent Roar entreat the characters to help prevent more violence.

#### Afsoun's Arrest

As things calm down in Three Sun Square, the Brightguard places any remaining Ashen Heirs under arrest. The Ashen Heirs are belligerent as they're arrested, proclaiming, "A few lost lives are nothing if it means the Brightguard falls!" Among the bystanders is the well-known actor [Afsoun Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/afsoun-ghorbani-jttrc.md). While the characters converse with Artavazda, read the following text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Two white-and-gold-clad Brightguards question a calm elf woman with dark hair, sharp green eyes, and a pink tunic over a red dress. One guard and the blue-skinned angel Artavazda lock eyes, and the angel nods. The Brightguards place manacles on the elf.
^35c

If the characters inquire about the woman's detainment, Artavazda explains that she's an infamous agitator who's worth questioning about her involvement in today's incident. The pari adds that she will be released in time—if she's innocent.

If a character attempts to intervene, Afsoun (chaotic good, elf [archmage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) tells the guards she doesn't know the character while discreetly signaling to them not to escalate. If the characters ignore that signal, any threats or combat this close to the Brightguard's headquarters attracts four [devas](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/deva.md), who defuse the situation through moderation—and by disarming belligerents.

#### Artavazda's Mission

Artavazda is concerned that the Ashen Heirs are planning to further disrupt the celebration of Shabe Taabaan. That morning, Ashen Heirs attacked merchants in the Ruz Bazaar. The merchants said the Ashen Heirs were seeking a magic jar recently unearthed in the nearby desert. The timely appearance of the Brightguard drove the Ashen Heirs away before anyone was hurt.

If the characters accept Artavazda's offer to work with the Brightguard, the pari explains the situation:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "[Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) worries for the safety of his people. Today's incident comes on the heels of an Ashen Heirs assault at the Ruz Bazaar, which shows their threat is increasing. We've learned they're seeking magic they can use to disrupt Shabe Taabaan. If the Ashen Heirs are left unchecked, I fear [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) will cancel the celebrations and impose martial law until the rebels' threat is ended. Will you help me prevent this?"
^35e

If the characters agree to Artavazda's mission, the angel explains that the Brightguard inspected the bazaar after the morning's attack but didn't learn much. Artavazda requests that the characters investigate further to determine what magic the Ashen Heirs were seeking, learn how they plan to use it, and put an end to their threat—preferably by bringing their mysterious leader to justice. The angel then provides directions to the nearby Ruz Bazaar.

## Chaos at the Bazaar

The Ruz Bazaar is a sprawling market as old as the city. The Ashen Heirs have been searching the bazaar recently, seeking a magic samovar. None of the merchants the Ashen Heirs shook down had the samovar, and the search was disrupted by the Brightguard just as the Ashen Heirs were interrogating a well-known rug merchant, Emad Farrokh.

### Ruz Bazaar

The main entrance to Ruz Bazaar is near Three Sun Square. When the characters enter the bazaar, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The covered stone halls of the Ruz Bazaar echo with the voices of merchants proclaiming the wonders of heady spices, fresh produce, and sun-themed Shabe Taabaan souvenirs.
^361

Anything made or grown in Akharin Sangar eventually finds its way to the Ruz. Characters can purchase crafts, food, festive keepsakes, and any "adventuring gear" in the "Player's Handbook" at normal cost.

If the characters accepted Artavazda's mission, they can spend 10 minutes conversing with merchants to confirm the angel's story: four Ashen Heirs using magic threatened and attacked multiple merchants. If a character succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or offers a merchant at least 1 gp, a merchant adds that the Ashen Heirs were looking for a magic vessel of some sort, and the last shop owner they attacked was Emad the rug merchant.

The characters can also learn about Emad by spending an hour investigating the bazaar. After doing so, have each character investigating the market make a Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. The character who has the highest check notices a halfling merchant watching them from the doorway of one of the bazaar's shops. This is Emad, and he slips inside his shop as soon as he's noticed.

#### Emad's Rug Shop

Emad is a middle-aged merchant (neutral, halfling [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) and the proprietor of a sizable black-market business. If the characters enter his shop, read the following text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The cramped, musty shop is filled with ornate rugs of many styles and designs. A brown-skinned halfling smiles and hops down from atop a stack of folded carpets beside the shop's wide-open doors. "Welcome! Does anything catch your eye?"
^363

From the front of his store, Emad sells all manner of rugs. At the shop's rear, several hanging rugs hide a secret room containing Emad's stock of foreign goods. Most of these wares are mundane, but all have been deemed illegal by the Brightguard. Emad has survived decades of inspections thanks to his calm, friendly demeanor, but the Ashen Heirs' shakedown has rattled him.

##### Talking to Emad

If questioned, the merchant plays down the day's events but confirms the Ashen Heirs sought a magic vessel. He denies knowing anything about it, but a character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check suspects he's lying.

Emad misses the time before [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s rule when the bazaar was packed with shoppers from faraway lands. That was before [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s stringent edicts limited visitors to the city. A character who succeeds on DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can get Emad to reveal his illegal dealings. Characters dressed in a way that marks them as being from lands far from Akharin Sangar have advantage on this check.

Once Emad feels he can trust the characters—or is coerced—he reveals the following information:

- Emad smuggles luxuries and other contraband [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) and the Brightguard have outlawed.
- His smuggling business is dwindling, as his contacts fear provoking [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) or believe there's no money to be made in the isolated city.
- Emad recently received a strange samovar from a treasure hunter in the Burning Dunes. He knows the jar is magical, but he hasn't been able to sell it or even have it identified due to the increased presence of the Brightguard in the bazaar.
- With citizens being detained despite scant evidence of wrongdoing, Emad's usual clients and contacts are wary of being seen at his shop until things settle down.

Additionally, Emad will show the characters his secret room if he thinks they're interested in buying contraband.

##### Investigating the Shop

A character who inspects the goods piled in Emad's shop and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notes that the thick rugs hanging at the back of the shop have been moved more often than the goods around them. If these display rugs are moved, the door to the hidden chamber is revealed. Proceed with the "Backroom Thieves" encounter.

#### Backroom Thieves

Whether Emad shows the characters his shop's secret room willingly or they find it themselves, there's a surprise waiting inside. Even if the characters don't seek out the room, the sound of something shattering inside reveals the room before they leave.

Two of the [Ashen Heir Mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/ashen-heir-mage-jttrc.md) who shook down local merchants earlier in the day have returned. When the mages threatened Emad before, one of them found the shop's secret room, but the Brightguard's arrival forced them to flee before they could investigate.

These two Ashen Heirs have squeezed through a window in the secret room that's disguised from the outside. They've riffled through the space and found not just the samovar they've been searching for but also a carpet of flying Emad has been trying to sell for months. The rug merchant foolishly scribed the rug's command word, "baalaa," on the carpet's tag.

Read the following text when the characters enter the secret room:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This chamber's shelves sag under crates and curios. On the far wall, a narrow window opens into a cluttered alley beyond. Just outside, two figures wearing menacing scarlet masks kneel on a flying carpet, one holding an ornate samovar. They laugh as the carpet shoots down the alley.
^367

### Bazaar Chase

As the two masked thieves soar away on the carpet, the characters can give chase.

Give the characters a moment to spring into action and swiftly come up with their own ways to fly after the thieves. If they don't have a method of flying, Emad produces another carpet of flying and loans it to the characters. He is vocal about wanting both carpets and the samovar back. Each [carpet of flying](/compendium/items/carpet-of-flying-4-ft-6-ft.md) from Emad's shop measures 4 feet by 6 feet, has a capacity of 400 pounds, and has a flying speed of 60 feet. It can accommodate two Medium or Small creatures.

After rolling initiative, each participant in the chase can take one action and move on its turn. The Ashen Heirs begin 120 feet ahead of the pursuers and 15 feet off the ground. Track the distance between the Ashen Heirs and the pursuers, and designate the pursuer closest to the thieves as the lead. The lead pursuer might change from round to round.

As the Ashen Heirs seek to escape, one controls the carpet while the other casts spells at any pursuers in range.

#### Dashing

During the chase, a participant can freely use the dash||Dash action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional dash||Dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). Unless it can move in some other manner, like riding a carpet of flying, a creature drops out of the chase if its [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature can remove the levels of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) it gained during the chase by finishing a short or long rest. The dash||Dash action cannot make a carpet of flying move faster.

#### Spells and Attacks

A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells against other creatures within range. Apply the normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks and spells. Chase participants can't normally make opportunity attack||opportunity attacks against each other, since they are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time.

#### Chase Complications

Complications occur randomly during the chase for both the Ashen Heirs and the characters pursing them. Each participant in the chase rolls on the Bazaar Chase Complications table at the end of its turn. If a complication occurs, it affects the next chase participant in the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant affected by the complication can spend "inspiration" to negate the complication. Unless otherwise noted, the events on the Bazaar Complications table affect a single creature; this should be the one controlling a carpet of flying if multiple creatures are on such a magic item.

**Bazaar Chase Complications**

| dice: d10 | Complication |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | A taught line of pennants stretches across your path. You must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, or you fall 2d4 × 5 feet, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen and landing [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone). If you are using a carpet of flying, any character on the same conveyance must also make this saving throw. |
| 2 | Choose to fly around or through a gap between bazaar stalls. If you fly around, the area counts as 10 feet of "difficult terrain". If you fly through the gap, you must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, or you break through the stall and take 4d6 bludgeoning damage. If you are using a carpet of flying, any other character on the same conveyance must also make this saving throw. |
| 3 | An overturned crate releases chickens and a cloud of feathers into the air. Make a DC 16 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to try to stay on course through the distractions. On a failed check, the obstacle counts as 10 feet of "difficult terrain". |
| 4 | You pass through an arc of knives thrown by performing food vendors (+3 to hit, 4d4 + 1 piercing damage on a hit). |
| 5 | You fly through hanging textiles. Make a DC 14 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to navigate the fabric. On a failed check, the path counts as 10 feet of "difficult terrain". |
| 6 | Spices from an overturned stand fill the air. You must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, or you are [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of your turn, roll on this table again, and immediately experience that complication.

#### Ending the Chase

The chase ends when either side gives up the chase, when the Ashen Heirs escape, or when the pursuers are close enough to catch the thieves. If neither side gives up the chase, one [Ashen Heir mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/ashen-heir-mage-jttrc.md) makes a Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check at the end of each round in which the Ashen Heirs get out of the lead pursuer's sight, after every participant in the chase has taken its turn. The check's result is compared to the passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) scores of the pursuers. If the result of the mage's check is greater than the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score, the Ashen Heirs escape. If not, the chase continues for another round.

#### Questioning the Ashen Heirs

If the characters catch the Ashen Heirs, the mages tell the characters everything they know in exchange for being let go before the Brightguard arrives. They share the following facts:

- The Ashen Heirs were ordered to find the samovar and return it to their cell's hideout.
- Their hideout is an abandoned temple in the Old City.
- Their cell leader is a wise sage named [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md).

If a character succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check, the thieves also hand over their masks and share the passphrase required to access their hideout: "Let the embers light the way."

#### The Stolen Samovar

The stolen samovar is an [iron flask](/compendium/items/iron-flask.md) containing a djinni. If opened, the samovar loses its magic (unlike a typical [iron flask](/compendium/items/iron-flask.md)) and releases a friendly [djinni](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) named Baadi. Baadi is a bombastic fellow who offers to grant the characters a wish if they help him find his cousin—another genie who lives in Akharin Sangar—though Baadi doesn't know where he is or what name he's using. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check notes that Baadi is bluffing and can't grant wishes. Baadi doesn't know that his cousin is the Ashen Heir leader, the efreeti [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md).

#### Returning to Emad

If the characters capture the Ashen Heirs, Emad gives them a carpet of flying as a reward—particularly if the characters don't reveal his illegal operations. If the mages escape, Emad promises to give the characters a carpet of flying if they retrieve and return the stolen samovar.

If the characters return the samovar without opening it, the halfling opens it while checking for damage and releases Baadi (see the previous section).

#### To Navid's Hideout

The characters' next move is likely finding the Ashen Heirs' hideout so they can complete Artavazda's mission. If the characters lost the Ashen Heir thieves or otherwise aren't sure where to go next, they can spend 15 minutes asking locals if they saw a flying carpet and make a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a success, they get vague directions that bring them to an abandoned temple (see the "Ashen Heir Hideout" section).

## The Lions' Plea

After contending with the members of the Ashen Heirs or completing their business with Emad, the characters are approached by a member of another revolutionary group, the Silent Roar, who has been observing the characters. The agent, a robed old human who uses the [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) stat block, gives each character a piece of pistachio nougat candy wrapped in paper stamped with the symbol of the Ghorbani Bakery, a smiling manticore. The agent says that the characters' "old friend Laleh" is anxious to see them, then walks away.

If the characters follow the agent, they lose sight of him near the Ghorbani Bakery but spot the manticore symbol on the bakery's awning. Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can also convince a passerby to identify the manticore symbol as the symbol of the Ghorbani Bakery.

### Ghorbani Bakery

[Laleh Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laleh-ghorbani-jttrc.md)'s bakery is a two-story edifice west of Three Sun Square. Inside, Laleh is hard at work. She wears a flour-dusted apron with flower motifs. She has high cheekbones, smiling brown eyes, brown skin, and an ornate prosthetic arm.

#### Laleh Ghorbani

[Laleh Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laleh-ghorbani-jttrc.md) (neutral good, elf [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)) uses her bakery as a safe house for the cell of the Silent Roar she leads with her sister, [Afsoun Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/afsoun-ghorbani-jttrc.md). The gregarious baker delights in conversation and plumbs her customers for gossip that might be valuable to the Silent Roar. She distrusts those who enforce [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s law without question.

##### Personality Trait

"I can't help but offer my guests food."

##### Ideal

"Change is like dough. It takes hard work to shape, but also time and patience for it to rise."

##### Bond

"My sister means the world to me. Her cause is my cause."

##### Flaw

"I sometimes freeze when faced with difficult decisions."

#### Talking with Laleh

When the characters enter the shop, Laleh presents them with a platter of desserts as she attends other customers. Once the other shoppers are gone, she locks the doors and apologizes for her strange invitation. Laleh is friendly toward the characters and guides the conversation to the following points:

- Laleh is the sister of [Afsoun Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/afsoun-ghorbani-jttrc.md), who was arrested by the Brightguard in Three Sun Square.
- Afsoun secretly leads the Silent Roar, a coalition of rebels that seeks to nonviolently overthrow [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) and put Akharin Sangar's people in power for the betterment of the city-state.
- Although the Silent Roar are rebels, they're not affiliated with the destructive Ashen Heirs.
- Laleh has received word that Afsoun was not released after her questioning. Laleh seeks information on where her sister is being held.
- While Afsoun is in Brightguard custody, Laleh has assumed command of the Silent Roar.
- Laleh can share any information from the "Akharin Sangar Gazetteer" section.

Laleh knows the characters have had dealings with the Brightguard, though she doesn't know the specifics. Regardless, she asks them to keep their ears opened for any information about her sister.

If the characters mention seeking the Ashen Heirs or their arrangement with Artavazda, Laleh offers assistance. The Ashen Heirs' recklessness endangers the work of the Silent Roar, and Laleh encourages the characters to put an end to the dangerous anarchists even if the characters aren't in league with the Brightguard. She promises that her agents will obtain any resources the characters need, such as the location of the Ashen Heirs' hideout, the passphrase to get in, or efreeti masks.

If the characters agree to help Laleh, she thanks them and says her agents will contact them later. Should the characters prove reluctant to help, Laleh tells them to think on what is right and promises to be in touch.

If the characters are forthright about working for the Brightguard, Laleh tries to recruit them as double agents. Should the characters stay loyal to the Brightguard, Laleh is disappointed but trusts them not to compound the tragedy her family suffered today. She still shares any information she has about the Ashen Heirs, seeking to put an end to their threat.

## Ashen Heir Hideout

The Ashen Heir hideout is a crumbling, one-story temple located in the Old City. Captured Ashen Heir agents or [Laleh Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laleh-ghorbani-jttrc.md) might direct the characters to the location.

Read the following as the characters approach the site:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A small, neglected temple stands within a courtyard surrounded by an iron fence and containing only dead overgrowth and a dry fountain full of garbage. A tower juts from the temple's roof; one of its walls bears tall vents to catch the wind.
^37a

A padlock holds closed a gate in the temple's 8-foot-tall fence, but it can be unlocked as an action with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) or broken with a successful DC 18 Strength check.

Characters who succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check also notice that the double door leading into the temple has a sliding peephole.

### Ashen Heir Hideout Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 11.2.

#### A1: Courtyard

The temple's courtyard lies in ruin, its stone paving overgrown with weeds. The fountain at its center is broken and filled with discarded furnishings.

##### Temple Entrance

The main door to the temple is made of solid wood and is barred from the opposite side. The door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength check, but doing so alerts the Ashen Heir [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) guarding the door in area A2.

If the characters knock on the door or otherwise make themselves known, the guard slides open the peephole and checks to see if they're wearing the Ashen Heirs' distinctive efreeti masks. If they are, he then asks for the passphrase. If a character answers, "Let the embers light the way," the guard unbars the door and admits them. Even if the characters never learned the passphrase, a character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check recalls that this was one of the more prominent slogans the Ashen Heirs were shouting during the incident at Three Suns Square.

If the guard sees the characters aren't wearing efreeti masks or the characters offer the wrong passphrase, he slams the peephole shut and alerts the other Ashen Heirs in area A2.

##### Windcatcher

A sand-green windcatcher rises from the temple's roof and directs cool air through the building. The tower's vents are 50 feet from the ground and open into a 10-foot-wide shaft that descends into the center of area A2. This shaft is marked with a dotted circle on map 11.2. A character can climb the temple's walls and the tower's interior with a successful DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

A [glyph of warding](/compendium/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) spell cast at 5th level is etched onto the south side of the windcatcher's interior. The first Small or larger creature that descends 10 feet down the shaft activates explosive runes. Any creature within 20 feet of the runes must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that fail take 31 (7d8) lightning damage, and then must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or plummet 40 feet to area A2, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and landing [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone). Creatures that succeed on the saving throw against the explosive runes take half damage and don't fall. In either case, all creatures in area A2 are alerted to the intruders' presence.

#### A2: Prayer Hall

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An unfinished mosaic depicting plants flourishing under a glowing moon adorns the walls of this prayer hall, though the mosaic is partially obscured by graffiti. Crates are strewn across the marble floor, and rickety scaffolding along the east wall serves as makeshift sleeping spaces.
^380

This temple was once consecrated to a god other than the Sunweaver, but it was abandoned years ago and became home to [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md)'s cell of the Ashen Heirs. Characters can enter this area via the front door or the windcatcher tower above its 20-foot-high ceiling.

If the characters have not alerted the anarchists to their presence, four Ashen Heirs are here: a guard near the door ([veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/ashen-heir-veteran-jttrc.md)), two more [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/ashen-heir-veteran-jttrc.md) playing cards, and an [assassin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/ashen-heir-assassin-jttrc.md) resting on the scaffolding. So long as the characters wear efreeti masks and attempt to pass as members of the group, the Ashen Heirs treat them as fellow anarchists. These cell members don't know much about [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md)'s plans or the samovar some of them were sent to track down, but they know their leader has big plans.

If the characters attack or damage anything in the area, the Ashen Heirs turn hostile.

##### Scaffolding

Three sections of sturdy wooden scaffolding were here when the Ashen Heirs claimed the temple. The scaffolding now serves as a resting place for members of [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md)'s crew. Each section of scaffolding rises 10 feet high.

##### Treasure

The crates scattered through the room hold 500 gp worth of stolen goods, including numerous fine jars stolen from the bazaar. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check while searching the scaffolding also discovers a set of [Nolzur's marvelous pigments](/compendium/items/nolzurs-marvelous-pigments.md).

#### A3: Hallway

This hallway features mosaics depicting the cycles of the moon. If both [mages](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) from the bazaar escaped with the samovar, one is lingering here. If one or neither of the mages escaped, this area is empty.

#### A4: Selenic Garden

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Natural rocks jut from the sizzling, red-sand floor of this sweltering, domed chamber. Dust-speckled light streams from eight stained-glass magic lanterns set around the ceiling, each embossed with the phases of the moon. At the room's center, a brown-skinned man with glowing eyes reclines upon a cushion. An attendant wearing a mask designed to look like an efreeti's face stands nearby.
^385

This cylindrical chamber once housed a lush garden, but [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) torched it to create more comfortable surroundings. The man here is [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md), leader of the Ashen Heirs, and his attendant is an Ashen Heir [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md). The characters recognize the mage from the bazaar if either of those Ashen Heirs escaped; otherwise, he's a stranger.

##### Burning Sand

The sand here is "difficult terrain". Any creature that enters the area of the sand or starts its turn there takes 7 (2d6) fire damage. [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) is immune to this effect, but his attendant keeps off the sand. A few large pieces of volcanic rock are scattered about the room and are safe to stand on.

##### Baadi the Djinni

If the characters failed to retrieve the stolen samovar during the bazaar chase, the [djinni](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) Baadi and the samovar are also present. If Baadi is here, read the following text after reading the initial boxed text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Several feet above the room's other occupants, an 8-foot-tall man with blue skin casually flies about the room. As he does, he peppers the reclining man with questions about sightseeing opportunities in the city.
^388

Baadi is eager to learn about Akharin Sangar after his century of imprisonment, but [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) silences him with a wave when the characters appear. Baadi stays out of combat. His samovar is discarded among the rocks near where [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) sits.

If Baadi is with the characters or is released from the samovar here, [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) reveals his efreeti form and is delighted to see his cousin. Not wanting to have their reunion in front of strangers, both genies thank the characters for reuniting them, then use [plane shift](/compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) to catch up elsewhere. [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) might return to Akharin Sangar someday, but without their leader any remaining Ashen Heirs are no longer a threat.

##### Audience with Navid

[Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) is an [efreeti](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) with the additional ability to cast [polymorph](/compendium/spells/polymorph.md) (self only) at will. He's currently wearing his preferred disguise, that of a human man in black and crimson garb. [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) was in line to rule the region around Akharin Sangar before [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) deposed his father, forcing the efreeti prince into hiding. Now he plots in the shadows, disguised as a visionary who disdains authority.

If the characters don't attack immediately, [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) calmly asks why they've paid him a visit. If asked about the actions of the Ashen Heirs, [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) justifies them by pointing out the futility of serving either the Brightguard or the Silent Roar. He describes both organizations as preserving a crumbling husk of a city-state, stating that the only way to move forward is to start anew.

[Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) attacks if threatened, revealing his true form. He fights until reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, at which point he uses [plane shift](/compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) to escape. His mage ally attacks along side him but surrenders if [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) is defeated.

##### Treasure

An iron chest is buried just beneath the burning sand. Any character who searches the room for treasure and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notes a patch of sand that was recently dug up. The iron chest can be exposed and opened by two or more characters working for 1 minute. The chest contains a gold crown inlaid with fire opals (worth 3,000 gp), a silvered sickle with a pearlescent pommel (worth 750 gp), and a spell scroll of [fly](/compendium/spells/fly.md). If the Ashen Heirs in the bazaar escaped on Emad's [carpet of flying](/compendium/items/carpet-of-flying-4-ft-6-ft.md), the carpet is here as well.

## After the Ashes

Once [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) is captured or otherwise dealt with, the characters can return to Artavazda at the Brightguard's headquarters—the Noble Jewel, near Three Sun Square. If the characters describe [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md) in his efreeti form, Artavazda remembers the hot-headed efreeti prince, and the pari murmurs thoughtfully, "Blood doesn't make you royalty. Only light can do that." Ultimately, [Navid](/compendium/bestiary/npc/navid-jttrc.md)'s downfall puts the pari's mind at ease, and Artavazda rewards each character with a pink diamond worth 500 gp.

If the characters abandon Artavazda's mission or agreed to aid Laleh, she soon contacts them with an invitation to the Twilight Rose theater for that night. The theater's guards will admit the characters if shown this invitation.

### A Second Request

If the characters neutralized the Ashen Heir threat, Artavazda offers them a second assignment as thanks. If any aspect of the previous mission went awry, the pari offers this assignment as a chance for the characters to correct their missteps.

Artavazda has learned another group of rebels, the Silent Roar, is planning a gathering that night at the Twilight Rose theater. The Silent Roar's dedication to nonviolent protest makes it less of a threat than the Ashen Heirs, but [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) doesn't tolerate dissent. The pari knows if the Brightguard raids the meeting, the Silent Roar's members will scatter. Artavazda hopes the characters can gather intelligence on the group and its plans prior to the Brightguard raiding the theater. Artavazda promises another 500 gp per character as a reward for this assignment.

If a character tells Artavazda about their meeting with [Laleh Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laleh-ghorbani-jttrc.md), the pari is delighted that they already have a connection with the Silent Roar—one they can use in the Brightguard's favor.

If the characters ask Artavazda for more information, the pari admits to working with vague information about the Silent Roar but insists the Brightguard is dedicated to keeping the people of Akharin Sangar safe from reckless revolutionaries, especially during Shabe Taabaan. If asked about [Afsoun Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/afsoun-ghorbani-jttrc.md), the pari explains that the rebel is being held for questioning outside the city at a site called the Pedestal of Judgment.

If, during this conversation, the characters sever ties with the Brightguard in favor of helping the Silent Roar, Artavazda is clearly wounded and flies away rather than immediately acting against the characters; Laleh contacts the characters with an invitation to the Twilight Rose soon after. Otherwise, when the characters are finished conversing with the pari, Artavazda gives them directions to the Twilight Rose.

## The Twilight Rose

The Twilight Rose is a few minutes' walk from Three Sun Square. As the characters approach the theater, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Colorful geometric tiles emboss the exterior of this two-story circular theater. People pass along the street, but all is dark behind the boards that cover the structure's windows. A tattered awning shades the theater's stout wooden double door.
^38e

The Twilight Rose was shut down by the Brightguard years ago for hosting performances deemed immoral. Despite this, the building's doors are unlocked. Any character who listens at the theater's front entrance or investigates the windows can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. On a successful check, the character hears a muffled voice within.

Characters who spend time surveilling the building see figures furtively open the front door and slip inside once every 10 minutes or so.

### Theater Lobby

Four Silent Roar guards ([veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) sit amid several small tables and chairs drinking tea and watching the entrance. Behind them, thick curtains close off the entrance to the theater proper. The guards are indifferent toward those who show an invitation from Laleh and hostile toward other strangers. A character without an invitation can persuade the guards to let the party pass by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Mentioning Laleh or showing goods from the Ghorbani Bakery grants a character advantage on this check. If a fight breaks out, Laleh appears on initiative count 0 of the first round and intervenes (see "Laleh's Plea" below).

### A Timeless Performance

As characters enter the theater, an actor is performing a monologue. Read the following description when they enter:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A dozen people stand in the darkened wings of a stage lit only by candlelight. The thirty people in the audience watch an actor costumed as a royal perform an impassioned monologue.
> 
> "We stand on a steep and dreadful precipice, but we can hide no longer," the actor proclaims. "Leap, my kindred! For our true home lies just beyond the darkness!"
^391

The thirty audience members ([commoners](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) in the theater assume the characters are simply latecomers and ignore their entrance. Should a character strike up a whispered conversation with an audience member, that local can share the following information:

- The actor on stage is an understudy for the famed actor Afsoun, whose incarceration has everyone on edge.
- The play being performed is called _The First Queen_, which tells the triumphant story of the first ruler of Akharin Sangar and the deliverance of her people from a fearsome demon.
- The play used to be a Shabe Taabaan tradition, but performances were outlawed by the Brightguard in one of [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s earliest decrees due to the play's glamorized portrayal of secular rule.
- The Silent Roar secretly performs _The First Queen_ in different spaces throughout the city. There's another performance coming up this evening.

The evening performance of _The First Queen_ is the event the Brightguard plans to raid tonight. It's nothing more than a harmless cultural event, though.

Soon after the characters enter, [Laleh Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laleh-ghorbani-jttrc.md) appears near the characters.

### Laleh's Plea

Regardless of the characters' reason for coming to the theater, Laleh commends the characters for finding her, saying their industriousness makes it clear that they're the best suited to help her. She's recently learned that Afsoun is still in Brightguard custody, being kept at a magical holding facility known as the Pedestal of Judgment, several miles outside the city. Laleh is eager to enlist the characters in a plan to save Afsoun.

If the characters agree to help Laleh, she goes on to explain that the Silent Roar has arranged a diversion in the city the following evening. Laleh expects this diversion will lead members of the Brightguard in the city to call upon those at the Pedestal of Judgment for support. This will leave the site where Afsoun is being held only lightly guarded. There's time before the plan is to commence, but when the characters are ready, she leads them to meet with a group of Silent Roar agents—see the "Pedestal of Judgment" section.

If the characters refuse Laleh's mission, she turns away without another word.

Regardless of how the characters interact with Laleh, the performance ends soon after, and the audience makes its way out.

### Artavazda's Last Mission

Upon learning that the Silent Roar is merely performing a banned play that evening, characters working with the Brightguard can report back to Artavazda at the Noble Jewel. The pari rewards each character with a ruby worth 500 gp.

If the characters don't reveal the imminent attempt to free Afsoun, the insightful Artavazda shares a concern about the likelihood of such a breakout. The pari asks the characters to go the Pedestal of Judgment and support the Brightguard members there in capturing alive any who attack the prison. Artavazda fears that if the Brightguard is guarding the platform, any Silent Roar members who appear will fight to the death, and Artavazda is eager to rehabilitate these largely nonviolent rebels.

In return for the characters' help in this endeavor, Artavazda offers to reward them with a gift from [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) himself and another 500 gp gem for each character.

## Pedestal of Judgment

The Pedestal of Judgment is a stone disc whose ancient magic keeps it hovering high above the arid landscape approximately 5 miles outside Akharin Sangar. [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) built this site for use as a holding prison to ensure Brightguard headquarters would be seen as a place of justice, not punishment. The Brightguard brings detainees to this platform for questioning and temporary incarceration, suspending them in magical crystals that only Celestials can use the Pedestal to create. Prisoners remain here until they are freed or are sentenced and transferred to Zendaane Sabz, [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s impenetrable Sky Prison.

### Preparing to Depart

The characters have likely been asked by [Laleh Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laleh-ghorbani-jttrc.md) or Artavazda—or both—to go to the Pedestal of Judgment. When the characters are ready to travel to the Pedestal of Judgment, either contact provides them with mounts.

If the characters are working with Artavazda, the pari grants each character access to a [pegasus](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/pegasus.md) from the Brightguard's stables. Artavazda tells the characters to fly to the northeast and to stay visible. The angels guarding the Pedestal of Judgment will recognize the mounts and allow the characters access to the platform.

If the characters joined forces with Laleh, she arranges a loan of mounts from the Tamers of the Winged Mane, a group of manticore riders in the nearby Heavenly Peaks. Laleh and her agents lead the characters to meet the tamer at the edge of the city. Each character is paired with one helpful, lawful neutral [manticore](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md). Before they depart, Laleh advises the characters to fly to the northeast to the hovering marble pedestal, flying low to stay out of view.

In both cases, the characters' ally encourages the party not to leave for the Pedestal of Judgment until the following dusk.

### Double Agents

Depending on how the characters choose to operate, you might end up combining aspects of both Artavazda and Laleh's missions to the Pedestal of Judgment. Characters working with [Laleh Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laleh-ghorbani-jttrc.md) might pretend to serve Artavazda, hoping to lull the pari into a false sense of security that makes the rescue of [Afsoun Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/afsoun-ghorbani-jttrc.md) easier. Or the characters might pretend to aid Laleh, but then report the Silent Roar agents when they reach the Pedestal of Judgment. Just as the politics of Akharin Sangar aren't cut and dry, so might the characters' plans get complicated. Work with the characters to come up with a plan and be flexible with how the adventure's factions respond. Keep in mind, though, that it's unlikely the characters can please both the Brightguard and the Silent Roar with their deeds.

### Site of Judgment

The flight to the Pedestal of Judgment is brief, taking approximately an hour by manticore and a half hour by pegasus. The characters draw near to the Pedestal of Judgment shortly before the glowing moon of Shabe Taabaan rises in the heavens.

Map 11.3 depicts the Pedestal of Judgment. As the characters near the site, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The Pedestal of Judgment appears before the city has faded from view. The sixty-foot-diameter disc is made from golden rose marble and floats three hundred feet above the rocky ground. Green crystals hover near the disc, like jeweled spikes adorning a crown. A handful of similar crystals slowly orbit the disc, twinkling in the night sky.
^398

If the characters are riding the Brightguard's mounts, two [devas](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) salute the characters and depart for the city—Artavazda has sent word informing these guards about the characters.

If the characters are coming to rescue Afsoun, there are no deva guards present, Laleh's diversion in the city having drawn them away from the platform.

#### Prison Crystals

Thirteen Sangarian [commoners](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) are frozen within the gold-banded, green crystals around the platform. These prisoners are a mix of criminals, resistance members, and ordinary citizens awaiting judgment. One crystal at the eastern edge of the platform holds [Afsoun Ghorbani](/compendium/bestiary/npc/afsoun-ghorbani-jttrc.md) (chaotic good, elf [archmage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)).

Each crystal is an immobile, Large object with AC 13, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Creatures inside the magic crystals are immune to all damage. A trapped creature is freed if its crystal is reduced to 0 hit points, or if the crystal is targeted with a [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell cast at 5th level or higher. The crystals leave their prisoners magically drained. If Afsoun is freed, she has 1 level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) and can only cast spells of 3rd level or lower until she finishes a long rest. She seeks to avoid combat unless the characters find themselves about to be defeated.

#### Sun Circle

A 10-foot-diameter circle at the center of the platform is inscribed with writing in Celestial that glows with a warm orange hue. The glyphs read, "All good acts take place in the light." The circle acts as a permanent [zone of truth](/compendium/spells/zone-of-truth.md) (spell save DC 17) and is where detainees are questioned at dawn.

#### Falling

A creature that falls from the platform or within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, they grab onto one of the crystals hovering near or just below the platform. On a failed save, they plummet 300 feet to the ground, taking 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage and landing [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone).

### Final Conflict

Depending on the characters' alliances, they might guard the platform or try to free Afsoun. Whether the characters are standing guard, attempting to free Afsoun, or scheming otherwise, soon after they're in position or their plan is in motion, they realize they're no longer alone. Read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Twilight covers the land as the moon fills the sky. The moonlight suddenly disappears, shrouding the land in darkness. An instant later, with a burst of radiance, the moon returns. In the deepest night of Shabe Taabaan, daylight washes over Akharin Sangar.
> 
> A shadow moves across the brightly lit platform. Overhead, silhouettes stand out against the radiant moon.
^39d

The identity of the creatures approaching depends on which side the characters are fighting, as detailed in "Fighting the Brightguard" and "Fighting the Silent Roar" below. Whichever enemies the characters face here, the stakes are too high for their foes to surrender or flee.

#### Aerial Combat

The characters might use their mounts to fight foes in the air, using the "mounted combat" rules in the "Player's Handbook". As intelligent creatures, the characters' mounts can act independently, but they also follow the characters' commands. A character's mount acts on its rider's turn.

If a character lands and dismounts on the Pedestal of Judgment, their mount takes to the sky during the next round, circling the platform until called.

#### Fighting the Brightguard

If the characters seek to free Afsoun, the shadows overhead are the [pari](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/pari-jttrc.md) Artavazda and two Brightguard [knights](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) riding two [pegasi](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/pegasus.md). They appear 30 feet in the air above the center of the pedestal. Artavazda expresses genuine disappointment with the characters and chastises them for turning away from the path of justice. The pari asks that the characters and their allies surrender and face arrest. As the characters are involved in a crime by attempting to free someone Artavazda considers justly arrested, the pari is unlikely to be talked out of apprehending them. During combat, the knights attempt to shove characters off the platform whenever possible.

#### Fighting the Silent Roar

If the characters are defending the Pedestal of Judgment for the Brightguard, they're confronted by three Silent Roar agents: two [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) riding [manticores](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md), and Marzieh, a [gynosphinx](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/gynosphinx.md) ally of the rebels and friend of Afsoun. The Silent Roar members are loyal to Afsoun and are unlikely to be talked out of abandoning their leader—particularly after enacting a plan to liberate her.

## Conclusion

After the battle, the characters can return to the city and report to whichever faction they chose before the final encounter.

### Returning to the Brightguard

If the characters are working for the Brightguard, Artavazda waits for them in a garden terrace atop the Noble Jewel. The pari is eager to hear how the characters' mission went and thanks them profusely for keeping Akharin Sangar safe. Artavazda promises that any foes the characters killed will be returned to life so they can face justice. The pari gives each character a sapphire worth 500 gp before producing a cloak made of flawless white feathers with a single golden feather that would sit high on the wearer's back. The cloak has the properties of [wings of flying](/compendium/items/wings-of-flying.md), and Artavazda explains that the golden feather is from the wing of [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) himself. Any Brightguard member will recognize the cloak's wearer as a friend of the Sunweaver and Akharin Sangar.

### Returning to the Silent Roar

If the characters free Afsoun, the rebel leader accompanies them to the city to reunite with her sister. Though the Silent Roar has little money to offer, Laleh and Afsoun offer the party personal treasures as a reward. Laleh gifts them her [hat of disguise](/compendium/items/hat-of-disguise.md), while Afsoun offers an [Ioun stone of leadership](/compendium/items/ioun-stone-leadership.md). The sisters also promise the characters a lifetime supply of free treats from the Ghorbani Bakery.

Afsoun must lie low now that she has defied the Brightguard, but the Silent Roar as a whole is invigorated by their leader's recovery. The group redoubles its efforts to oppose the Brightguard and [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md).

### What's Next?

Regardless of the characters' allegiance, their actions and the fallout of Afsoun's detainment or escape have broad implications for Akharin Sangar. The Silent Roar's resistance efforts increase in either case, causing the organization to become the Brightguard's greatest rival. If the characters remain in Akharin Sangar, Artavazda or the Ghorbani sisters seek to enlist them in the factions' conflict. As either the Brightguard continues to crack down on rebels or the Silent Roar encourages wider resistance, the characters are likely to be drawn into increasingly desperate conflicts, eventually coming to the attention of the land's ruler, [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) himself.

## Akharin Sangar Gazetteer

From the turquoise spires of this holy city-state's oldest temple, a radiant angel watches over Akharin Sangar. His name is [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md). For many, his presence is a source of comfort: a promise of protection and guidance. But a growing proportion of Sangarians find his rule suffocating. The angel's word is law, his doctrine rigid, and his enforcement absolute.

Akharin Sangar is a vibrant city-state with a deep appreciation for art and tradition. It rests on a plateau beneath the Heavenly Peaks, a bulwark of rugged, snow-capped mountains that have protected their lands for centuries. Though most inhabitants reside in the city or the surrounding hills, more stalwart folk brave the Burning Dunes, where kenku scavengers scour the ruins of old civilizations and rocs soar over adobe settlements like massive vultures.

Akharin Sangar has all but closed its gates to the rest of the world. Outsiders often surmise the city-state is full of zealots as severe as the city's angel ruler. In truth, Sangarians are a friendly, hospitable people, eager to share their traditions with visitors and unhappy with [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s embargoes and nightly curfew. A fellowship of artisans, philosophers, and merchants has formed a secret coalition known as the Silent Roar that seeks to oust [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) and revive the city by instituting rule by the people. Meanwhile, pernicious anarchists called the Ashen Heirs foment unrest, striving for change at any cost.

### Features

Those familiar with Akharin Sangar typically know the following facts:

- **Hallmarks.** Akharin Sangar is a theocracy presided over by Celestials. It's known for its isolation and history of political turmoil.
- **People of Akharin Sangar.** Sangarians are predominately human with brown or black hair and fair to rich brown skin tones. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and gnomes represent a little over one-third of the populace, and some in the city claim to have a touch of Celestial ancestry.
- **Languages.** The primary language is Zabaani. Although all citizens also speak Common, the lack of visitors to Akharin Sangar means they have few chances to practice it. Celestial is also commonly spoken among [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s followers and theologians.

### Noteworthy Sites

The city-state of Akharin Sangar is steeped in proud traditions. While its city is a hub of culture, the surrounding lands are fraught with magic and danger.

#### Three Sun Square

Three Sun Square is an important hub whose three architectural marvels exemplify the pillars of local society—religion, government, and economy.

##### Avalin Sahar

The decorative turquoise-and-gold facade of the city-state's oldest temple, Avalin Sahar, beckons all to kneel in worship of the deity locally known as the Sunweaver.

##### Noble Jewel

Members of the Brightguard, a holy order of protectors and enforcers, call the Noble Jewel—once the royal palace—their headquarters. Occasionally, [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) appears on the palace's garden terrace to issue a proclamation, much like the rulers who preceded him.

##### Ruz Bazaar

Fragrant spices lure shoppers to the bustling Ruz Bazaar, a sprawling complex of vendors that hides an underground market.

#### Foothills of the Heavenly Peaks

The hills beneath the Heavenly Peaks are fertile, blessing farmers with bountiful harvests of juicy pomegranates, buttery pistachios, and crimson strands of saffron. Rebellion also flourishes, as the Brightguard has a smaller presence here, and the nation's curfew is not enforced. Free thinkers gather at aged teahouses, discussing philosophy as they sip from steaming cups, and acting as secret missionaries who dare to defy angelic law.

#### The Sky Prison

Deep within the majestic desert east of Akharin Sangar, the floating edifice of Zendaane Sabz, known more commonly as the Sky Prison, hangs over a lake of shattered glass. The prison is a crystalline hive peppered with demiplanes of divine judgment. Inside lurk potent evils banished by [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md), such as Faasadi the Rotten, an [adult blue dracolich](/compendium/bestiary/undead/adult-blue-dracolich.md), and the ageless Chesmare, a [beholder](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) who can do nothing but admire her own reflection in a mirrored cell that neutralizes her power. Given [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s intolerance for misconduct, the prison's population continues to grow, but now it fills with more ordinary folk guilty of lesser crimes.

### Life in Akharin Sangar

Despite the rumors outside its borders, Akharin Sangar is markedly hospitable. By long-standing custom, every Sangarian is a potential host and must be prepared to entertain guests on short notice. Visitors are invited to relax on luxurious carpets adorned with colorful pillows while their host prepares them hot beverages—if not an entire meal.

#### Education and Art

A thirst for knowledge permeates Akharin Sangar. Its many independent schools are free to teach broad curricula that beget a well-read populace, although the long list of censored works constrains opportunities for higher education, especially in philosophy and literature. The city-state cautiously embraces progress, adopting developments in magic and science as long as they don't contradict religious principles.

Akharin Sangar has a rich artistic heritage. Architecture is thoughtful and symbolic, and instruments like the barbat and kamancheh sweeten poetic lyrics with their unmistakable tones. Sangarian carpets exemplify the city-state's long history of vibrant textiles: painstakingly woven rugs are highly sought works of art. Some are even rumored to fly.

#### Food and Clothing

Sangarian cuisine emphasizes savory, sweet, and sour flavors. When households entertain guests and during festivals, kabobs and hearty stews infused with saffron grace dinner plates alongside beds of rice. Bakers stay busy, filling bellies with chewy flatbreads and scrumptious pastries tinged with rosewater. But Sangarians know how to stretch small pots of a soup called aash to feed an entire family.

Clothing is generally modest, and Sangarians value fashionable dress. Men's attire consists of baggy trousers, handwoven shoes, and robes or tunics secured with wide cloth belts. Women typically dress in layers, sporting long, elegant skirts and blouses with heavy embroidery. Floral patterns are common regardless of gender, and colors range from vivid to muted depending on preference. Common headwear includes scarves, caps, and headbands with veiled hats.

#### Laws and Society

Unprepared visitors might find some aspects of Sangarian society unusually austere. Intoxicants are prohibited within the city, there's a strict curfew after sundown, and everyday interactions are tinged with restraint to steer clear of [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s forbiddances. Sangarians reserve intimacy for family and close friends, lowering their social guard only in the comfort of their homes.

#### The Sunweaver

Most Sangarians revere the Sunweaver—or pretend to. Locally, the Sunweaver's faith uses an upright torch topped with a blazing sun as its symbol. Activities halt during daily prayers, which take place at dawn, noon, and sundown. Though other faiths are tolerated, those faiths are sequestered in shrines on the city's outskirts. Public preaching is considered taboo, and unauthorized missionary work earns the ire of the Brightguard. The nature of the Sunweaver and whether they're a unique god or a regional name for another deity—like Dol Arrah or Pholtus ("detailed" in the "Player's Handbook")—is up to you.

The Sunweaver holds ultimate authority in Akharin Sangar, which is a theocracy ruled by the god's self-proclaimed messenger. [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) interprets the Sunweaver's doctrine and encourages all citizens to cultivate light and warmth. The Sunweaver's clerics hold significant power. In addition to priestly duties, they act as government officials and judges, employing divination magic in audits and trials.

Those who break the law answer to the Brightguard. The religious order enforces the law without prejudice, though its ranks contain both tender-hearted civil servants and disciplinarians who relish chastising citizens for misdemeanors.

#### Names

Sangarian names are drawn from lineage, religion, and literature and are often suffused with symbolism and history. The following names are common in the region:

- **Feminine.** Forough, Mariam, Nazanin, Shohreh, Yasamin
- **Masculine.** Amir, Bahram, Farshid, Hassan, Ramin
- **Gender-Neutral.** Keyahnosh, Omid, Roshani, Shadan, Sorosh
- **Surnames.** Farzaneh, Nasri, Pasdar, Rasul, Setar

### Legends of Akharin Sangar

Akharin Sangar's most famous historical tale is an epic poem about its heroic founder, Piruzan. When Piruzan's people were tormented by the horned demon Zolmate Shab, she led them up the Heavenly Peaks in search of a land free from tyranny and darkness. The demon intercepted them at the summit, appearing in a pillar of smoke. Emboldened by the coming dawn, the first Sangarians prepared to make a last stand. With the power of the Sunweaver, Piruzan banished the relentless demon. She became queen of this new land and ruled for over three hundred years, never forgetting the Sunweaver's warmth.

Akharin Sangar flourished during the dynasties that followed but eventually succumbed to excess, corruption, and complacency. Darkness fell upon the city-state, and Zolmate Shab returned. As demons beset the city, Sangarians prayed to the Sunweaver, and [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) answered. After an earthshaking battle, the angel emerged victorious.

Afterward, [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) prophesied the return of Zolmate Shab, even stronger than before, if the people of Akharin Sangar fell from grace again. After fifty years of peace, though, most Sangarians have come to doubt the prophecy's legitimacy, and many question whether the angel's rigid control of the city-state is justified.

#### Atash

[Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) (lawful neutral [solar](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/solar.md)), the angelic ruler of Akharin Sangar, came to the city-state's aid when all hope seemed lost. After smiting Zolmate Shab's fiendish army with righteous fury, [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) elected to stay, believing his mission incomplete. In the early years of his rule, [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) walked among the common folk, performing miracles. Over time, he withdrew from his people, tired of witnessing them repeat their mistakes. He spends his days in contemplation, occasionally breaking his silence to address an increasingly distraught populace.

[Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md) possesses an ageless and inflexible perspective. Everlasting and seemingly emotionless, the angel answers complex problems with direct solutions. He believes that only by following his decrees can Sangarians prevent another demonic incursion. He deems those who oppose him outlaws.

##### Personality Trait

"I'm being tested. I've not heard the Sunweaver's voice since my rule began."

##### Ideal

"To disobey the Sunweaver is to protest truth."

##### Bond

"I must protect the people of Akharin Sangar, even from themselves."

##### Flaw

"The subtleties of mortal nuance are simply the repetition of mortal mistakes."

### Characters from Akharin Sangar

If players want to create characters native to Akharin Sangar, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**How have you been affected by the angel Atash's rule?** What changes have you or your loved ones made in response to [Atash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md)'s edicts? How has this theocracy benefited or harmed you?

**Do you worship the Sunweaver?** If not, do you make that known? How has this affected your life?

**Do you behave differently in private than in public?** Whom do you trust? Are you part of resistance efforts, or do you actively oppose them?

## Pari

A pari is an angelic harbinger gifted with foresight. A visit from a pari is often a prophetic warning or portent of an event yet to come. Pari have pastel blue skin, wear robes and armor, and have two sets of wings with vivid red feathers sprouting from their back.
