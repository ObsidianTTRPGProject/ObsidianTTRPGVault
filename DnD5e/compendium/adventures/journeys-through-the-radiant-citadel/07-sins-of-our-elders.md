# Sins of Our Elders
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel* 

_An Adventure for 6th-Level Characters_

A beloved folk hero of the city of Yeonido was wronged by the royal family and died in shame. Unable to rest peacefully, she returned as a spirit called a gwishin and became convinced that the city she had dedicated her life to had forgotten her. Now the powerful spirit spreads a mysterious fog across the land that drains the memories of Yeonido's people so they aren't even aware of their own ruin.

## Background

For decades, Dae Won-Ha dedicated her life to Yeonido, serving as a magistrate and protector as the city-state developed into a hub for trade. As Yeonido's population exploded after years of prosperity, Won-Ha ensured that the city was expanded with care for the wilderness, and the lower-class laborers and artisans of Yeonido reaped the benefits of the city-state's success. The common people cherished her, but the attitude of others was not so kind.

In time, merchants seeking to line their pockets began to embezzle government funds. City planners accelerated expansion into the forest without care for sustainability, and the local nobility began to monopolize the benefits of the booming economy. Whenever Won-Ha protested, royal advisor [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md)—the brother of Queen Young-Soo—dismissed her concerns and undermined her authority. Eventually, political tensions turned the folk hero into a figure of infamy. Meanwhile, [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) publicly gave Queen Young-Soo credit for all of Won-Ha's achievements, ensuring that the queen's legend would never fade, while Won-Ha was forgotten. Unable to bear the lie swallowed by her beloved people, Won-Ha grew ill and died. She passed on with no money, no clan, and no deeds credited to her name.

When Queen Young-Soo died ten years ago, a monument to her was unveiled in the city's Park of the Elders. The next night, Won-Ha rose as a type of ancestral spirit called a gwishin and began haunting the monument. When no family claimed the spirit as their descendant, the city's spirit arbiters—magistrates responsible for rogue gwishin—tried to quell the angry spirit. As a former magistrate herself, though, Won-Ha's spirit managed to avoid the spirit arbiters and is growing in power.

Just as Won-Ha was intentionally removed from Yeonido's story during her lifetime, her gwishin believes she has been forgotten by the city's people. In response, Won-Ha's gwishin has cursed the city's people, causing them to forget the source of the ruin she brings down upon them.

### Setting the Adventure

Use the following suggestions to help contextualize Yeonido in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters traveling from the Radiant Citadel arrive only a few miles outside Yeonido. If you wish to further detail the city and its surroundings, use the "Yeonido Gazetteer" section at the end of this adventure.
- **Dragonlance.** Either the island of Enstar or the New Coast region could host Yeonido. The distant relationship between the people of Krynn and their gods could be another reason why some of the city's dead have difficulty finding peace.
- **Forgotten Realms.** The city of Yeonido could appear at the northeast edge of the Gulthmere along the Sea of Fallen Stars, making it an isolated but growing trade city at the edge of a vast wilderness.

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure:

- **Festive Homecoming.** Every spring, the people of Yeonido gather to encourage a bountiful harvest during the weeklong Dan-Nal Festival. The characters' families or friends invite them to visit for the festival.
- **Friend of Ahn-Jun.** A character has a connection to Magistrate [Kun Ahn-Jun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kun-ahn-jun-jttrc.md), perhaps knowing them as a family friend or having helped them obtain supplies for Yeonido in the past. When Ahn-Jun has strange experiences no one else remembers, the magistrate asks that character to come to Yeonido to investigate.
- **Lost and Forgotten.** Someone the characters know has died mysteriously in Yeonido, and no one knows why. The characters go to the city to learn more about this tragedy.

## Cycle of Dread

A bitter spirit and strict local traditions trap Yeonido in a cycle of quiet suffering. While spirits called gwishin are well known among the city's populace, social mores prevent people from speaking openly about their dead ancestors. One vengeful gwishin takes advantage of this custom to torment the city.

### Gwishin

Gwishin are the spirits of those who were wronged in life and died without receiving justice. They are intimately connected to Yeonido and the traditions of the city itself. While some manifest as Undead creatures, others are spiritual forces that seek to express an unfulfilled desire or familial shame.

Reputation is of paramount importance to the people of Yeonido, who adhere to strict social norms to avoid bringing shame to their clan. If a family member dies and becomes a gwishin, the burden is on the clan to appease the spirit. Asking for help would require the family to publicly acknowledge the missteps that created the gwishin—which is considered more shameful than the peril an unchecked gwishin might cause. But a gwishin's power grows over time, making it important for these troubled spirits to be quelled quickly.

#### Gwishin of Dae Won-Ha

The rage of Won-Ha's gwishin has gone unchecked for decades and is focused on the statue of Queen Young-Soo in the Park of the Elders. Throughout the adventure, the characters can obtain relics connected to the memory of Won-Ha. These objects can help the characters establish a connection to Won-Ha's spirit and potentially put the gwishin to rest.

Won-Ha's spirit manifests its power throughout Yeonido in two ways.

##### Spirit Fog

Won-Ha's gwishin can cause fog to "lightly obscure" the city within 1 mile of the Park of the Elders. The fog lasts for 5 minutes, though the gwishin can disperse it sooner. The gwishin can summon this fog up to three times per day.

##### Faded Memories

When the summoned fog fades, each creature of the gwishin's choice within the fog must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is cursed and permanently loses its memory of the fog and what happened within, its mind filling in the gap in time. Creatures that can't be communicated with telepathically are immune to this effect. A [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) or [greater restoration](/compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell cast on an affected creature restores its true memory. The gwishin typically manipulates only the memories of Yeonido's residents, not those of visitors.

### Yeonido Customs

A character who wants to understand more about Yeonido's customs related to gwishin and the dead can learn the following by asking the city's residents or by succeeding on a DC 12 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check:

- Yeonido's people are expected to present a brave face regardless of what hardships they're facing personally.
- Talking about another person's mishaps in public brings great shame to that person. To be good neighbors, people don't speak openly about others' troubles. This reluctance to speak of others' hardships makes talking about gwishin taboo.
- Residents of Yeonido readily assist their neighbors and help one another if asked, but also go to great lengths to ignore—or plausibly not see—things that might be embarrassing to others.
- To speak ill of the royal family—particularly the popular Queen Jin-Mi—is to betray a profound trust.

If a distasteful topic is broached with a citizen of Yeonido, conversation turns awkward. Most people try to change the subject unless they are pressed, and then they speak vaguely or in hypotheticals.

## Starting the Adventure

The adventure begins as the characters near the walls of Yeonido. Read or paraphrase the following description as the party draws close to the city gates:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The curving walls of the city of Yeonido come into view. Atop the walls, tall, colorful flags and ribbons flutter from poles. Traders, guards, and workers come and go through a grand gate, passing from the surrounding farmlands into the maze of graceful structures beyond. As you watch, a pale mist rises from within the city. It drifts through the gates and breaks over the walls as if the entire city were exhaling one great breath.
^1b6

The fog emanating from within Yeonido encompasses the city, lightly obscuring every street and building, including the interiors. This fog is unnatural, which a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check realizes. The [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell also reveals that the fog emanates an aura of enchantment magic.

As the characters near the city gate, they notice the guards and other travelers are bewildered by the strange weather but do their best to ignore it or joke to hide their insecurity. If asked about the fog, locals say they've never seen anything like this.

The characters have no way of knowing it, but this fog is created by Won Ha's gwishin (detailed in the "Gwishin of Dae Won-Ha" section).

### Peril in the Fog

Soon after the characters arrive at the gate, three hostile [gargoyles](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) swoop down to menace the people nearby. The gargoyles all resemble the same fierce-looking woman with a mouth full of fangs, claw-like nails, and feathered wings. Two [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) cover the retreat of panicked locals as the gargoyles attack traders' wagons or anything that threatens them. The gargoyles fight until destroyed, and they dissipate into mist when defeated, leaving no remains behind.

The fog covering the area vanishes 1 minute after the gargoyles appear. If the gargoyles are still alive, they vanish along with the fog.

#### Fading Mists

As the fog fades, the guards and other locals menaced by the gargoyles look momentarily perplexed by where they are and any damage that's been done around them, but then stoically go about their business again as if nothing had happened. If asked about the fog, the monsters, or other occurrences within the fog, they react with bewilderment. Locals have had their memories altered as detailed in the "Gwishin of Dae Wong-Ha" section—but the characters aren't affected. Locals don't fixate on the characters' confusing questions or any strangeness affecting anyone nearby, as is local custom (see the "Yeonido Customs" section). The [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals that locals—in fact, almost all the creatures in Yeonido—radiate an aura of enchantment magic, an effect of the curse affecting their memories. There is one exception to this.

### Distressed Magistrate

As the characters question the locals or otherwise demonstrate that they've experienced a strange event, a local magistrate notices them. The magistrate approaches if the characters react to this scrutiny or as the characters prepare to leave the gate.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An official wearing a red and blue outfit embroidered with phoenix designs approaches. "I apologize for my impertinence," they say, "but I have an odd question I have to ask. Have you just suffered an unusual experience?"
^1ba

The magistrate is [Kun Ahn-Jun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kun-ahn-jun-jttrc.md), the only person in Yeonido who isn't affected by Wong-Ha's curse.

#### Kun Ahn-Jun

Magistrate [Kun Ahn-Jun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kun-ahn-jun-jttrc.md) (neutral good, human [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) is a rising star in Yeonido's city bureaucracy despite their unassuming presence. They are humble and shy but show their inner strength during crises. Thanks to their [ring of mind shielding](/compendium/items/ring-of-mind-shielding.md)—a gift from their mother, who was also a magistrate—they have not been affected by Wong-Ha's curse, as the spirit can't telepathically alter Ahn-Jun's memories. Ahn-Jun treasures the ring and usually keeps it invisible—a property of the ring—while wearing it. The magistrate takes little solace in this protection, though, as they don't know what's befallen the city or why, and they fear the strangeness is all in their own mind.

##### Personality Trait

"Please let me know how I can help. I'll do my best!"

##### Ideal

"I know who I am, and I know my limits."

##### Bond

"Magistrates should do everything in our power to serve those who need assistance."

##### Flaw

"I have to check to reassure myself that my work has been done right, even if I just checked."

#### Sole Witness

Ahn-Jun is quietly distraught about the events affecting Yeonido. They can't make sense of what's happening and fear they're suffering visions or worse. If the characters claim to have seen the fog and creatures within it as well, Ahn-Jun is relieved and shares the following details with the party:

- No one else in the city has seen the fog, but it's been rising and falling multiple times every day for weeks.
- The fog used to occur only every now and then, but it has been growing more frequent.
- Ahn-Jun has tried to tell people about it but is always ignored.
- Strange monsters have slain people in the fog. Those who've witnessed the tragedies are shocked anew by the sight of bodies when the fog dissipates. The deaths are always considered accidents or bizarre but isolated incidents.
- If the characters don't already know about the city's customs, Ahn-Jun shares the details in the "Yeonido Customs" section and notes that these mores contribute to locals' willingness to overlook the strangeness afflicting the city.

After sharing these details, Ahn-Jun asks the characters to help them uncover what mysterious magic is afflicting Yeonido and can pay each character 250 gp. Ahn-Jun also promises to inform the city's rulers of the characters' service.

#### Where to Investigate

Once the characters agree to assist Ahn-Jun, the magistrate notes three locations the characters should investigate:

- **Construction Site.** Located outside the city walls where the Tiger District abuts the nearby forests, this construction site has suffered numerous attacks and unexplained setbacks.
- **Park of the Elders.** Several attacks have occurred at this royal park in the Haetae District.
- **Tea Shop.** The city's oldest tea shop is located in the Phoenix District. Two nobles were found wounded and nearly dead outside it only a few days ago.

Ahn-Jun can offer directions to all of these locations. While Ahn-Jun's job prevents them from traveling with the characters, the characters can contact the magistrate by speaking with the guards at the Seat of Dragons, the city's center of government.

## Exploring Yeonido

The characters can explore Yeonido and visit the locations Ahn-Jun directed them to in any order. Use the "Yeonido Gazetteer" section to detail locations beyond the investigation sites. The city as a whole is depicted on map 6.1.

### Tiger District

The Tiger District is a relatively new part of the city and is still undergoing construction, particularly along the forested stretch being cleared to the northwest. Even though the locals don't recollect the fog and beast attacks that Wan-Ha's gwishin uses to impede their work, they're aware that accidents, vandalism, and missing workers delay construction.

When the characters visit the area near the forest, they find a large construction site full of scaffolding and equipment. Laborers clear stumps and raise the frames of new houses while armed guards keep an eye on the nearby forest for signs of trouble.

Shortly after the characters arrive, Overseer Hwang Jung-Soon, the official in charge of the site, approaches them.

#### What the Overseer Knows

Hwang Jung-Soon (lawful good, human [guard](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md)) is friendly and speaks evenly, but she's frustrated by her site's setbacks and is protective of her workers. She wants to know what the characters' business is at the potentially dangerous construction site and asks them to leave if they seem to simply be sightseeing. If the characters openly carry weapons, she's hopeful that they've been hired by the magistrates to investigate the recent accidents at the site.

If asked, Jung-Soon doesn't know anything about the fog, strange events, or attacks on the camp. However, characters who succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check sense that she's holding back something in her response. Those who push her by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check get Jung-Soon to share some of the strangeness she's experienced, like finding dents on her weapons or personally suffering inexplicable minor wounds at random—unknown to Jung-Soon, these are the results of defending her work site from creatures appearing amid the fog.

Jung-Soon can also share the following details:

- Her laborers are in constant fear. They think some creature or gang is trying to harm them. No one's seen anything, but accidents and sabotage are common.
- She's frustrated with the city's magistrates, believing they're failing to protect her people.
- Dangerous animals live in the nearby forests, particularly tigers, and she has guards to keep such threats at bay. Regardless, she doesn't think animals are to blame for the danger around the work site.

Talk of sabotage is Jung-Soon and her workers' way of explaining what's happening to them. The strangeness at the work site is a result of the memory-affecting fog and creatures under the control of Wong-Ha's gwishin. If the characters ask to see any damaged equipment or Jung-Soon's scars, they bear what look like claw marks. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check thinks the marks are from large feline claws.

#### Work Site Attack

During the conversation with Jung-Soon, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) score is the first to notice fog drifting into the work site from the southeast. A round later, the work site is "lightly obscured" by the fog.

A moment after the fog rises, four tigers (use the [saber-toothed tiger](/compendium/bestiary/beast/saber-toothed-tiger.md) stat block) appear from the direction of the forest. These hostile tigers are 12 feet long and have blue-tinged fur. The site's workers and hired guards flee upon seeing the tigers, but Jung-Soon stands her ground. The tigers attack her or any creature that appears to be a greater threat.

##### Defeating the Tigers

The tigers discorporate into fog if defeated. They also vanish, along with the fog, 5 minutes after the fog appears. Before the last tiger vanishes, it retreats, heading toward the forest north of the construction site and a path hidden there (see the following section).

##### After the Attack

When the fog vanishes, neither Jung-Soon nor the workers recall the fog or tigers.

#### Shrine of the Hero

An overgrown path heads into the forest near the construction site. A character might discover it by following a fleeing tiger or by investigating the tree line and succeeding on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

The path is made of worn, muddy stones, and it leads 400 feet into the forest. It ends at a rocky pedestal bearing a slab of marble covered in moss and a simple stone lantern. A faint blue flame glows within the lantern.

##### Moss Slab

The moss on the slab can be cleared to reveal an inscription that reads "Dae Won-Ha, Warrior for the People" in both Common and Halri (the local language of Yeonido). Characters who succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check recognize the name as an obscure magistrate from Yeonido's past. Few others recognize the name, but Ahn-Jun does if asked (see the "Lingering Memories" section). Anyone who recognizes the name also knows it's odd that such a figure would have a shrine dedicated to them—an honor usually awarded only to heroes.

##### Lantern

The lantern bears a magical flame that emits dim light for 10 feet and no heat. The [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals that the candle has an aura of evocation magic. If the name Dae Won-Ha is spoken within 10 feet of the candle, it momentarily flares in intensity. The lantern also flickers if brought within 10 feet of the teacup from the Phoenix District or the amulet [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) carries (see the "Phoenix District" and "Estate Gardens" sections). The lantern can be moved and weighs 3 pounds. If the lantern is brought before the gwishin of Dae Won-Ha in the Park of the Elders, the spirit might be convinced the people of Yeonido still remember her.

### Phoenix District

The oldest area in the city, the Phoenix District is adjacent to the royal palace known as the Seat of Dragons, and it is populated exclusively by nobles and the wealthy elite. Despite locals not recollecting the attacks in the area, the people know many have been harmed on the streets and fear that some gang or murderer is at large. The tea shop the characters are looking for is famous and is easy to find by asking any passerby.

#### The Tea Shop

The oldest tea shop in Yeonido was simply called the "Tea Shop" when it was built hundreds of years ago, and so it remains known to this day. The shop is decorated with hundreds of teacups arrayed on shelves; many cups bear the names of famous past patrons, adventurers, nobles, and royals.

The owner, a talkative, neutral human [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) named Bi Chin-Hae, greets everyone who enters, offering to prepare them a pot of buckwheat or jujube tea. Chin-Hae grows taciturn if asked about the recent attack near his shop or the troubles in the city, speaking about these events only in vague terms—he doesn't want the area around his shop to be considered dangerous. A character who purchases a pot of tea for 2 sp or who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can convince Chin-Hae to mention that the two nobles attacked near his shop were named Nah Dae-Shim and Da Ju-Won and that they often play the game of baduk at the nearby baduk hall, a raised courtyard that's the social center of the Phoenix District.

Outside the shop, no evidence of the recent attack remains.

#### Baduk Hall

The baduk hall is three blocks away from Chin-Hae's tea shop. Characters who have proficiency in [Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance) know baduk is a game of strategy played on a board using black and white pieces. Additionally, baduk halls are popular gathering places, particularly for old or noble families.

At the baduk hall, dozens of pairs of players concentrate at tables covered in circular, black and white pieces. Hall guards or attendants can easily direct the characters to Dae-Shim and Ju-Won.

Nah Dae-Shim, a dwarf man, and Da Ju-Won, a human woman, are in the middle of an intense game. Both are neutral [nobles](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md). They're not unfriendly, but they're not interested in talking at the moment. The pair are happy to talk after their game—but it will take 3 hours to reach its conclusion. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces the nobles to take a break from their game to talk. Alternatively, a character who watches their game and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check can point out strategic opportunities in the game to both sides, causing the game to conclude in 10 minutes.

#### Talking with the Nobles

When they're ready to talk, Dae-Shim and Ju-Won call for rice wine and ask the characters their business. The pair willingly share any of the following details.

- During a visit to the Tea Shop after dusk about a week ago, Dae-Shim and Ju-Won were both nearly killed.
- They both recall seeing a strange woman lingering near the shop.
- The next thing either of them remembered, they were waking up. Passersby found them near the shop and summoned a priest to aid them.

Neither of the nobles knows who the woman was, and they have no memory of the fog. However, if a character succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, one of the nobles reluctantly reveals they think she was a gwishin. They can provide any of the information in the "Gwishin" section earlier in this adventure, but they don't like talking about such things. The nobles don't know why such a spirit might be lurking around the tea shop, but they suspect the proprietor Chin-Hae would know.

#### Back to the Tea Shop

If the characters return to the Tea Shop and ask Chin-Hae about the spirit seen around his shop, he claims to know nothing about that. If pressed, though, he shares the following information:

- He has seen a spirit that resembles a long-dead but regular customer who was famous in her time: Magistrate Dae Won-Ha.
- He has infrequently glimpsed the spirit near his shop, but also once at the Park of the Elders when he was walking home around midnight.
- Dae Won-Ha was an active magistrate and hero of the people, responsible for many social works.
- She was ultimately overshadowed by the last queen, Young-Soo. Chin-Hae doesn't know what happened to her after that.

As he explains this, he fetches a pair of teacups from a shelf. The cups are a set and bear the names [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md)—the uncle of the current queen and brother of Young-Soo—and Won-Ha. As the cup bearing Won-Ha's name is taken down, it glows with a faint blue light and pulses every time the name Won-Ha is spoken within 10 feet of it. It also flickers if brought within 10 feet of the lantern from the Tiger District or the amulet [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) carries.

Chin-Hae allows the characters to borrow the cup if they ask. If the cup is brought before the gwishin of Dae Won-Ha in the Park of the Elders, the spirit might be convinced the people of Yeonido still remember her.

If asked about [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md), the shop owner shares that the elderly noble still occasionally visits the shop, but he is retired and spends much of his time at home. If the characters choose to visit [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md), proceed with the "Estate Gardens" section.

### Haetae District

The Park of the Elders, in the Haetae District, is a beautiful public space devoted to walking and peaceful contemplation. It features a stately monument to the late Queen Young-Soo, aunt to Queen Jin-Mi. Read the following description if the characters visit this statue:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The monument depicts a regal dragonborn seated on an ornate throne, a vision of wisdom and grace. She cradles a large scroll in one arm and raises the other hand as if about to speak. Stone plaques set into the statue's foundation are engraved with Queen Young-Soo's many achievements.
^1d1

A character who reads the plaques and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check recalls that many of the queen's accomplishments echo those of the obscure magistrate Dae Won-Ha. If asked, Ahn-Jun also notes the overlap with the magistrate's efforts (see the "Lingering Memories" section).

If the characters arrive before speaking with [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md), the park is lovely but empty. After they've learned more about Dae Won-Ha as part of their investigation, they encounter her gwishin here, as detailed in the "Spirit of the Past" section.

### Estate Gardens

Former royal advisor [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) spends little time at the great palace known as the Seat of Dragons these days, instead enjoying retirement in the gardens of his small estate, where the Phoenix District meets the Haetae District. The characters might learn about [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) from Chin-Hae at the Tea Shop or by speaking with [Kun Ahn-Jun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kun-ahn-jun-jttrc.md). Four [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) at the gate to [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md)'s estate prevent strangers from meeting with the nobleman uninvited, but Ahn-Jun can provide the characters with a message to win them a meeting. Alternatively, a character who succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces the guards to let them see [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md).

When the guards admit the characters, they escort the characters to the estate's gardens. Read the following when the characters enter:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Trees hide the estate's walls from view, creating the illusion of being in a forest clearing. A pond dominates the center of the garden, with a pavilion overlooking the water. The place is a serene sanctuary, hidden from the clamor of the surrounding city.
^1d3

A few moments later, an elderly dragonborn man enters the garden. This is [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md).

#### Young-Gi

As the uncle of the current queen, Jin-Mi, and brother of the previous queen, Young-Soo, [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) (neutral, dragonborn [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) is accustomed to wealth and privilege. A life spent enjoying his status has made him charming and personable but also haughty. As he ages, however, he remembers the few true friends he once had and regrets how he treated Dae Won-Ha.

The elderly dragonborn's red scales aren't as lustrous as they once were, and he wears fine silk robes to compensate.

[Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) is also a victim of the gwishin's curse, so he doesn't recall the fog or the threats that appear within. But as he knew Dae Won-Ha and personally downplayed her achievements, he knows much about her past. He's not eager to reveal it, though.

##### Personality Trait

"Thank you for speaking to me. I promise you my full attention."

##### Ideal

"There is nothing more important than family, don't you think?"

##### Bond

"I hope the people will remember me as a hero."

##### Flaw

"Some members of my family waste their privilege and influence. I don't."

#### Forgotten Secrets

[Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) is calm and charismatic, and he listens intently when the characters speak. Because the elderly dragonborn is secure in his position, he isn't worried about the characters' visit. If they mention Dae Won-Ha, he's surprised and grows reflective. He shares his memories only if the characters present him with the lantern from Dae Won-Ha's forgotten memorial or her teacup, or if a character succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If convinced to speak about his old friend, he shares the following information:

- Dae Won-Ha was a brilliant magistrate and hero of the people. Much of the prosperity and equality Yeonido now enjoys is due to her work.
- Few remember Won-Ha's efforts, attributing them to [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md)'s sister, the former queen, Young-Soo.
- Although the people once honored Won-Ha, the magistrate died in relative obscurity.

##### The Forgotten Magistrate

If [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) is asked why Won-Ha was forgotten, he's reticent to answer. Through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, a character can convince the noble to confess the following truths:

- He was personally responsible for undermining Won-Ha's work and crediting her successes to his sister, Queen Young-Soo. He did this not out of malice, but out of devotion to his family and the crown, believing any individual who the people place above the ruling class must be treated as a threat.
- He regrets what he did, but he has never worked up the courage to make amends to Won-Ha's spirit. He fears doing so will tarnish his sister's memory and, by extension, his niece's rule.

##### The Forgotten Spirit

If the characters try to convince [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) that something strange is happening in the city, he's not surprised. He doesn't recall the fog, but he's seen Won-Ha's gwishin several times at the royal park called the Park of the Elders, specifically late at night near the statue to his sister Young-Soo. Since Won-Ha had no surviving family members, he finds it conceivable that her gwishin could have lingered for years since her death, growing powerful enough to affect the city. [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) has called on spirit arbiters to investigate the park in the past, but they found nothing.

##### The Forgotten Amulet

[Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) encourages the characters to seek out the spirit at the Park of the Elders around midnight. If they agree, he produces a tarnished gold amulet with Won-Ha's name etched on it. This was one of her symbols of office, a memento of their former friendship that he's kept for years. If brought near the lantern from the Tiger District or the teacup from the Phoenix District, the amulet faintly glows. If the amulet is brought before the gwishin of Dae Won-Ha in the Park of the Elders, the spirit might be convinced the people of Yeonido still remember her.

## Lingering Memories

Once the characters have visited some of the sites above, they'll likely learn the name Dae Won-Ha or [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md), but they might not discover who these individuals are or how they relate to the city's past.

At any point, the characters might visit [Kun Ahn-Jun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kun-ahn-jun-jttrc.md) at the Seat of Dragons. If asked about Dae Won-Ha, the magistrate doesn't recognize the name but can research her history. After four hours, the magistrate returns with the following facts:

- Dae Won-Ha was a celebrated magistrate in her time.
- The people of the newly constructed Tiger District built a small shrine honoring her in a nearby grove.
- She was close with the noble [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md).
- Her career faltered, eclipsed by the successes of the renowned Queen Young-Soo.

If the characters ask about [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md), Ahn-Jun also shares the following information about him:

- He's an elderly noble who lives at the edge of the Phoenix District.
- He's the brother of the last queen, Young-Soo, and the uncle of the current queen, Jin-Mi.
- Ahn-Jun can arrange for the characters to speak with him if they please.

Ahn-Jun knows nothing about any glowing antiques the characters might find or what use they have.

If the characters need any other pointers to put together the pieces of Dae Won-Ha's past or direct them toward seeking the spirit at the Park of the Elders at midnight, use Ahn-Jun to nudge them in the right direction. The magistrate has heard rumors of a gwishin that lingers near the statue of Queen Young-Soo in the Park of the Elders, but they volunteer this information only if the characters have visited the other locations in the city and don't know what to do next.

## Spirit of the Past

Once the characters learn about Dae Won-Ha and that her gwishin often appears at the Park of the Elders near the statue of Queen Young-Soo, proceed with this final encounter. This area is depicted in map 6.2.

Won-Ha's spirit waits until midnight before appearing. When the characters are near the statue at midnight, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The beauty of the park changes as fog spreads from the base of the monument to Queen Young-Soo. Something shapeless and malevolent wraps itself around the statue, coalescing as a robed figure that shrieks in pain and rage.
^1df

A mysterious fog covers the park, lightly obscuring the area. The gwishin of Dae Won-Ha manifests from the fog at the base of the statue as a [ghost](/compendium/bestiary/undead/ghost.md). She appears as a middle-aged woman with dark hair and mournful features. Two [gargoyles](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) emerge out of the mist along with the spirit; like the gargoyles from the start of the adventure, they bear Won-Ha's face. Once defeated, these creatures discorporate into fog. Won-Ha's gwishin reappears 24 hours later, though, and continues to imperil the city until she is put to rest.

### Memories of Dae Won-Ha

Despite being driven by sorrow and rage, the gwishin of Dae Won-Ha is willing to speak to the characters. Her initial communication is limited to mournful statements like "They've all forgotten me" and "I was nothing, I am nothing—soon they'll be nothing." To engage with Dae Won-Ha meaningfully, the characters must present evidence that people still remember her—particularly by showing her mementos from her life: the lantern from the Tiger District, the teacup from the Phoenix District, and the amulet [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md) kept safe.

If the characters present one or more of these tokens, or they attempt to speak with the dead and succeed on a DC 16 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, the gwishin is calmed enough to talk; see "Conversing with the Gwishin." Additionally, depending on how many tokens the characters present, the following effects occur:

- **One Token.** The [gargoyles](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) vanish into the mist.
- **Two or More Tokens.** In addition to the gargoyles' disappearance, the fog fades from the park.

If the characters present no tokens and don't speak with the spirit, the gwishin and the gargoyles attack.

#### Conversing with the Gwishin

If the characters speak with Dae Won-Ha's gwishin, she can tell them the information in the "Background" section. She's angry that the city she dedicated her life to has forgotten her. She uses her accursed fog to make Yeonido's people suffer but forget why, leaving them with only pain and quiet confusion.

#### Putting the Gwishin to Rest

Once the characters have learned Dae Won-Ha's story, they can convince her gwishin she hasn't been forgotten in one of two ways.

##### Presenting Some of the Tokens

The characters can prove the people of Yeonido still remember Dae-Won by presenting any of the three tokens of remembrance and succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If the characters present two tokens, they have advantage on this check. If the characters fail this check (or haven't obtained any of the tokens yet), the gwishin attacks. If the characters succeed on this check, the gwishin makes them promise to spread the truth of her works and [Young-Gi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/young-gi-jttrc.md)'s role in hiding her successes across Yeonido. Should the characters do this, the gwishin finds peace, and neither she nor the fog returns. If they refuse or don't uphold their promise within a few weeks, her threat continues.

##### Presenting All the Tokens

If the characters present three tokens, the gwishin marvels that she hasn't been forgotten and thanks the characters. Before she vanishes for good, she provides the characters with the following charm (a type of "supernatural gift" detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

##### Memory of the Ancestors

This charm calls the spirit of one of your ancestors to inhabit one weapon of your choice and watch over you. A weapon in your possession becomes a weapon of warning for the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes from you, and the weapon returns to normal.

## Conclusion

Once Dae Won-Ha's gwishin is reassured that she hasn't been forgotten, the memory-affecting fog ceases to appear and the curse afflicting the people of Yeonido ends, restoring their memories. The characters might have more work to do to finally lay the gwishin to rest, such as reminding the city of Dae Won-Ha's historic role in the city's ascent to prosperity. [Kun Ahn-Jun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kun-ahn-jun-jttrc.md) can help the characters with this and suggests restoring the magistrate's shrine outside the city and circulating records of Won-Ha's works. Ahn-Jun might also arrange a meeting with Queen Jin-Mi, who supports restoring knowledge of Dae Won-Ha's deeds.

If the characters don't follow through with their promise to the gwishin, the fog and mysterious attacks continue across the city.

Once the gwishin is put to rest, Ahn-Jun makes Queen Jin-Mi aware of the characters' role in saving the city. The Queen meets the characters, hailing them and Ahn-Jun as heroes and rewarding each party member with 500 gp rather than the 250 gp Ahn-Jun originally offered.

## Yeonido Gazetteer

The people of Yeonido, the City of Judgment, pride themselves on upholding tradition. Thousands of years ago, the great dragon Mireu entrusted the founders of the city-state with a mandate to forge and lead a great civilization. Yeonido's people took the dragon's words to heart, establishing a reverence for fealty and order that has remained steadfast through the centuries. Two main beliefs form the foundation of Yeonido society: that structure is key to all things, and that adherence to familial duty trumps all but one's devotion to the royal family.

But those noble traditions have a troubling side: the disquieting ancestral spirits called gwishin that refuse to leave the world behind. When a citizen of Yeonido dies feeling wronged or knowing that they've harmed others, they return as one of these spirits. It's up to the spirit's family to resolve the injustice and bring peace to the gwishin, allowing it to move onward. If a gwishin is allowed to endure, it grows ever more dangerous.

In recent years, some in Yeonido have begun to challenge the cultural reverence for ancient traditions, creating unease and discord. It may be no coincidence that gwishin are appearing more frequently than ever before, but it's unclear if more citizens are dying with unfinished business or if something more sinister is at work. Some even believe that the royal family has lost the trust of the great dragon Mireu. Everyone has an opinion, but no one knows how to restore harmony in Yeonido.

### Yeonido Features

Those familiar with Yeonido typically know the following details:

- **Hallmarks.** Yeonido is known for its citizens' familial loyalty and reverence for tradition, as well as for ancestral spirits called gwishin.
- **People.** Humans and dragonborn are the most populous folk in Yeonido. Humans from Yeonido are primarily dark-haired and dark-eyed, and dragonborn have colorings based on their bloodlines, most commonly red or blue-green scales.
- **Languages.** The city's official language is Halri, a language related to Draconic, though all citizens are also fluent in Common.

### Noteworthy Sites

The city-state of Yeonido is nestled among fertile hills and deep forests. Though many dangerous beasts dwell in those lands, farming villages surround the walled city of Yeonido itself, supporting the city and benefiting from its protection.

#### The Seat of Dragons

In the center of Yeonido stands the Seat of Dragons, the palace that houses the royal family and government. The outer palace walls are a brilliant red, and the drawbridge over the moat is always open to allow citizens to enter. Important ceremonies take place in the castle courtyard, where Queen Jin-Mi can often be seen greeting her people.

Though the Seat of Dragons has no magical wards protecting it, gwishin never enter the palace grounds. Some speculate that this is because the Pearl of Mireu—a legendary gift the draconic founder of Yeonido granted to its people—is hidden somewhere in the palace.

#### Yu-Ik River

The Yu-Ik River flows just outside Yeonido's walls and is an essential part of the city. The riverbank holds a bright community of market stalls, colorful art, traders, peddlers, tinkers, and vendors of food and drink. On official holidays, people gather along the riverbank to tie ribbons on tree branches, play games along the shore, and celebrate with good food. However, these gatherings sometimes turn ugly, with fights breaking out due to muggings and territorial disputes arising among merchants. Cautious vendors often hire guards to protect them from trouble.

#### Dokkaebi Temple

Not far from the city, this cursed temple sits on a cliff above a majestic waterfall. Foolhardy children dare each other to spend the night within the forbidding temple—a challenge that has sometimes proven fatal. The temple is brilliantly painted with a thousand colors and marked with hundreds of spiritual seals. Although the site is rumored to be filled with treasures, only the most reckless thieves consider breaking in, for countless gwishin rage there each night, their screams echoing for miles.

### Life in Yeonido

The people of Yeonido are proud of their traditions and welcoming to those who respect their ways.

#### Structured Society

Yeonido's residents believe in sacrifice for the good of the community. One must work selflessly, listen to one's elders, and act according to one's status for Yeonido to prosper. Structure is the central pillar of society. Class structure and family structure are key components of life within the city. Change is possible, but usually only when it's driven by members of the royal family or the noble clans. Queen Jin-Mi sits at the apex of the social order, followed by the noble elite, the various ranks of government magistrates, and the heads of each familial clan.

#### Clans and Identity

Clans live in compounds that often hold every member of the family, organized with its own hierarchy and led by a designated elder. But clans extend beyond families, often adopting outsiders who take up permanent residence in the city-state. When people meet, they exchange clan information before personal details, and the few folk in the city who have no clan—whether they were ejected from a clan or never adopted into one—are viewed with sympathy.

When people marry—whether for love or for social or political reasons, both of which are considered equally valid—they must choose which partner's clan they will belong to after the union. In rare cases, a new couple decides to establish their own clan, though they often face judgment from their birth clans.

#### Rule by Magistrates

The city-state of Yeonido is ruled by the beloved Queen Jin-Mi, a dragonborn said to be descended from the city's founder and first ruler, the dragon Mireu. The bureaucracy surrounding her consists of officials known as magistrates, who govern the city-state and enforce its laws. Those who aspire to become magistrates must undergo the exams—known collectively as the Test of Ascension—that take place each spring. These tests are notoriously difficult, and typically only those wealthy enough to afford time to study and special tutoring pass. Still, many less affluent but dedicated students have used this path to change their social status. Even non-citizens are allowed to take the test if they show proper respect for the process.

#### Spirit Arbiter

Magistrates called spirit arbiters specialize in bringing an end—peaceful or otherwise—to rogue gwishin. They investigate the appearance of these spirits, soothe them, and then attempt to right the wrongs that hold them in the world. If left with no recourse, spirit arbiters destroy gwishin, but they seek to avoid doing so. These somber magistrates are known for the traditional, broad-brimmed black hat, called a gat, that they each wear as part of their uniform.

#### Names

Family comes first in Yeonido, and thus an individual's clan name is spoken before their given name. The royal family is an exception—they have no clan name, since it is expected that everyone should know them at first glance.

Given names in Yeonido typically have two syllables. Within each clan, siblings and cousins of the same generation often share one syllable of their name. For example, a couple might have a son named Ji-Min and a daughter named Ji-Yun. The head of the clan chooses each new child's name. The following are examples of common Yeonido names:

- **Clan Names.** Bae, Chun, Ha, Ju, Seong
- **Feminine.** Gyung-Won, Hana, Ji-Yun, Su-Min, Yun-Hi
- **Masculine.** Do-Won, Gang-Min, Habin, Ji-Min, Oh-Seung
- **Gender-Neutral.** Haneul, Han-Sol, Ji-Su, Si-Won, Yu-Min

### Legends of Yeonido

According to the oldest tales, the Dokkaebi Mountains rose above a world shrouded in mist. All lands were bleak and terrifying in those days, cloaked in endless darkness. Those who had hope in their hearts set their sights on the Dokkaebi Mountains and traveled to the foothills, praying that something would save them.

Three great dragon siblings saw the penumbral world and descended from the heavens. The dragon Mireu gave the mortals at the Dokkaebi Mountains a divine gift—a pearl infused with the dragon's own heavenly power, which drove back the mist. Mireu's people formed the city of Yeonido, while the other two dragons established the lands of Xing and Umizu. Tales say that the Seat of Dragons in Yeonido is still home to Mireu's pearl, proof of the city's divine origins. However, if the pearl exists, its location is a secret fiercely guarded by the royal family.

The story of Yeonido's origins is often accompanied by the cautionary tale of the first gwishin. Her name has since been stricken from all records, but she was the sister of a king. Jealousy grew in her heart, and she raised her hand against her sibling. For this crime, she was struck down by Mireu, and a sickly monster appeared in her place.

### Characters from Yeonido

If players create characters from Yeonido, ask them the following questions:

**What is your social class and clan?** Is your family part of the nobility or the working class? Do you want to change your status? Are you an active member of your clan or have you left it behind?

**Do you have a special role in the city's hierarchies?** Are you a member of the royalty? Did you or do you hope to pass the Test of Ascension and become a magistrate? Are you an arbiter who deals with spirits?

**How have gwishin affected you?** Did a member of your family return as a gwishin? Did your family deal with their own gwishin, call aid in dealing with it, or let it linger? Did a gwishin of another clan teach, harm, or otherwise interact with you?
