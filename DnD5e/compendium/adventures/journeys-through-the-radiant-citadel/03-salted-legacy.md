_An Adventure for 1st-Level Characters_

A series of disturbances plagues the Dyn Singh Night Market, an endlessly changing maze of stalls filled with incredible wares, enticing smells, and magical lights. Accusations fly as the characters become entangled in a feud between the well-respected Tyenmo and Xungoon merchant families of the Siabsungkoh valley. To prevent the families' conflict from escalating, the characters must earn the trust of the market's vendors and gain their help to unmask who's behind a rash of vandalism and thefts.

## Background

The Xungoon and Tyenmo families have always had a complicated relationship. While their trades and relationships to the Dyn Singh Night Market differ, their stubbornness and intense family loyalty are the same. Both believe they're paragons of what a night market merchant should be while also believing the other family has been jealously sabotaging them for years. Despite this, the current heads of the two families, [Lamai Tyenmo](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lamai-tyenmo-jttrc.md) and [Kusa Xungoon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kusa-xungoon-jttrc.md), have vowed not to continue what is now a multigenerational rivalry. These family heads have even begun to seek each other's counsel and plant the seeds of friendship. But in recent weeks, thefts and vandalism targeting both families' businesses have rekindled old suspicions, and the feud threatens to reignite.

### Setting the Adventure

The Dyn Singh Night Market could be any city's bustling trade district. Use the following suggestions to help contextualize the market and all of Siabsungkoh in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Residents of the Radiant Citadel seeking a different selection of goods than those available in the Trade Discal might be referred to the Dyn Singh Night Market. Those who travel to Siabsungkoh arrive a quarter mile from the market, which is impossible to miss.
- **Eberron.** Given its eclectic array of goods, vendors, and colorful magical signs, the Dyn Singh Night Market could be part of Sharn's Tradefair Market, with the overseeing Dyn Singh Merchant Collective being House Cannith, House Ghallanda, or some combination of other dragonmarked houses.
- **Forgotten Realms.** The Siabsungkoh valley might appear amid the Cloud Peaks of Amn or along the Vilhon Reach. The Dyn Singh Night Market can make a distinctive addition to any region known for trade.

### Visiting the Night Market

Before starting the adventure, use the following hooks or work with players to determine why the group has come to the Dyn Singh Night Market:

- **Connoisseur.** The group seeks a rare treasure, local delicacy, or expert artisan available only at the night market. Alternatively, they want to sell a possession to or obtain an appraisal from a merchant with an unusual specialty.
- **Market Regular.** A character grew up in the land surrounding the night market, and visiting the market is an important part of their life. Coming to the market and showing it to their friends is an exciting treat.
- **Trade Expedition.** The characters represent their homeland, a group with which they're affiliated, or the Radiant Citadel. They want to establish trade with a vendor at the night market or obtain goods for those in need.

## Welcome to the Market

Hundreds of temporary stalls, tents, and vendor carts fill the Dyn Singh Night Market with wonders to tempt even the pickiest customers. The shops surround three golden tents in a sunken plaza. Merchants set up during the afternoon, but most don't open until twilight when the evening's cool air attracts customers.

The vendors are a tight-knit community, and many have attended the market for decades. Their wares vary from common goods to rarities. Some merchants price their wares plainly; others haggle, trade, or exchange goods for favors. Notable shops in the market include the following:

- **Madam Kulp's Silk.** This store sells luxurious silk garments for no less than 50 gp apiece.
- **Spicy Brothers.** This stall sells spices, peppers, and spicy dishes like cucumber fire smoothies and honey-glazed hot chips for 5 sp each.
- **Trusty Leek.** This street food cart specializes in bite-sized and skewered seafood dishes. It relocates regularly throughout the evening.
- **Tyenmo Noodles.** This food vendor offers vegetarian noodle bowls made with handmade noodles and fresh green tree beans for 1 gp.
- **Vada's Otherworldly Goods.** This shop sells pastries and desserts for 1 sp each. The signature vanilla bun is made from a secret family recipe and sells for 2 gp.
- **Va's Lucky Amulets.** This shop hocks a mixture of charms and curios, the most popular being monkey's bane charms and owl's wing rings, both of which are said to fend off sickness and animal attacks. The trinkets are nonmagical and cost 2d10 cp each.
- **Xungoon Family Seafood.** This food vendor sells fishcakes, fresh wailing slug, diamond-throated carp, and shimmering vampire fish for 1 gp apiece.

### Rival Vendors

Dyn Singh Night Market vendors [Lamai Tyenmo](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lamai-tyenmo-jttrc.md) and [Kusa Xungoon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kusa-xungoon-jttrc.md) inherited a long-standing rivalry between their families, but they want to move past it. Circumstances and family grudges conspire to exacerbate their enmity. In the course of the adventure, the characters are drawn into their conflict.

#### Lamai Tyenmo

[Lamai Tyenmo](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lamai-tyenmo-jttrc.md) (lawful good, gnome [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) has dark, wild hair and a wide smile. She recently took over as head of the Tyenmo family business, Tyenmo Noodles. The weight of the new responsibility hangs heavy on her, but she is determined to make her family proud.

##### Personality Trait

"The land sustains us, and we honor her by sharing what she provides."

##### Ideal

"I will add to my family's legacy by becoming the most successful vendor in the market."

##### Bond

"My grandfather took care of all of us; now we must take care of him."

##### Flaw

"I refuse to back down from a fight if the honor of my family is on the line."

#### Kusa Xungoon

[Kusa Xungoon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kusa-xungoon-jttrc.md) (lawful good, kobold [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) dresses in impeccable purple-and-gold silk gowns and has polished horns. She runs a respected market stand, Xungoon Family Seafood, and seeks to expand her family's business. She cherishes her son, Gammon, whom she's teaching to take over the business.

##### Personality Trait

"Success for my business and success for my family are one in the same."

##### Ideal

"My family's legacy will spread across the land."

##### Bond

"My son is the light of my life."

##### Flaw

"It's not that I'm paranoid; it's that a lot of people want what I have."

### Exploring the Market

Read the following text once characters reach the Dyn Singh Night Market:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> As the sun dips below the horizon, the Dyn Singh Night Market twinkles to life, gradually igniting in a dazzling display. The smells of food carts filled with pot stickers, coconut desserts, spiced meats, sticky buns, and more drift amid bright bouquets of glowing flowers and magical lights in the shapes of vendors' wares and whimsical mascots. Crowds of shoppers wander the stalls, drawn by the colors, smells, and music.
^04e

Give the party the opportunity to wander the market and visit some of the aforementioned vendors or stalls. Indulge in descriptions of colorful magic lights and glowing vendor signs; tempting street foods; and the array of peoples who make up the crowd, from humans and gnomes to kobolds and orcs.

### Caught in the Middle

As characters explore the market, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Shouting rises over the sounds of haggling shoppers and the sizzle of cooking street food. A shrill voice cries out, "Give it back, you little thief!"
> 
> "No, you're the thief!" replies a youngster with a panicked squeak. An instant later, a frantic kobold bursts from the crowd clutching a sizable bunch of green onions. A flustered gnome woman chases him.
^050

[Gammon Xungoon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/gammon-xungoon-jttrc.md) (chaotic good, kobold [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) stole a bunch of green onions from [Lamai Tyenmo](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lamai-tyenmo-jttrc.md). Gammon believes Lamai first stole these onions from his mother. At the moment, neither is interested in listening to reason.

Gammon clumsily collides with a random character, bounces off them, and falls to the ground. A moment later, Lamai catches up and attempts to yank the green onions from Gammon's hands while railing at him. A character can separate the squabblers by intervening physically and succeeding on a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check or by engaging diplomatically and succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

Less than a minute later—whether or not the characters get involved—Gammon's mother, [Kusa Xungoon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kusa-xungoon-jttrc.md), appears from the surrounding crowd.

### Family Feud

[Kusa Xungoon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kusa-xungoon-jttrc.md) intercedes between Lamai and her son, sternly telling the gnome shopkeeper, "That's enough, Lamai! You're behaving no better than our parents did: stealing from me and attacking my son!"

This kicks off a fresh bout of arguing, with Lamai claiming she saw Gammon steal the onions (which is true). Gammon accuses Lamai of first stealing the onions from their seafood cart and knocking it over (which is speculation). Rapid-fire, increasingly outlandish indictments and assumptions follow. If the characters don't interrupt the argument, Kusa notices one or more of them. Read or paraphrase the following text when she does:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The arguing kobold woman notices you and turns from her son and the irate gnome shopkeeper. "You! You strangers look like capable sorts. I'm [Kusa Xungoon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kusa-xungoon-jttrc.md), proprietor of market-famous Xungoon Family Seafood: for a fish typhoon, you'll wish for Xungoon! Help us deal with this scoundrel and I'll make it worth your while!"
> 
> "Scoundrel?!" the gnome shouts, turning your way. "You don't look like you're wrapped up in market politics. I'm [Lamai Tyenmo](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lamai-tyenmo-jttrc.md). Help me figure out what's going on here, and I'll give you a lifetime supply of delicious noodles from Tyenmo Noodles!"
> 
> Both women turn toward each other again, quarreling anew over what they'll offer you to help them.
^052

Kusa and Lamai argue in front of the characters, upping their offers to include as much as 100 gp, as well as increasingly grandiose delicacies and family cooking secrets such as a feast of thrice-fried tarrasque trout or the secret of making bewildering mobius noodles. Both vendors are eager to prove the other is to blame for the vandalism and sabotage both of their market stalls have been suffering. Neither has entertained the notion someone else might be to blame for their ill fortune or that other shops might also be affected.

Kusa and Lamai stop bickering either when the characters interrupt them or when their argument meets an appropriately ludicrous climax. At this point, the party can choose to ally with one or the other for a 100-gp reward and a lifetime supply of free meals at their employer's cart. The request from either vendor is the same: investigate the shopkeepers' stands and the surrounding market and prove their rival is sabotaging them. The shopkeeper will take any evidence the characters find, present it to the Dyn Singh Merchant Collective that oversees the market, and have their rival banned from the market. If the characters don't want to pick sides but agree to investigate, both shopkeepers convince themselves they've successfully hired the party.

If the characters refuse to get involved, one of the shopkeepers approaches them later under calmer circumstances, restating their concerns about their shop's safety while making their offer again.

### Around the Market

Following the heated exchange, the gawking crowds and shopkeepers disperse. The characters don't get far before another market vendor approaches them. This human man wears a flashy green shirt with a high collar and gold filigree trim designed to look like hot peppers. He smiles while shaking his head as he approaches and introduces himself as [Kasem Aroon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kasem-aroon-jttrc.md), one of the owners of the Spice Brothers stall.

#### Kasem's Plan

[Kasem Aroon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kasem-aroon-jttrc.md) (chaotic neutral, human [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) and his twin brother, [Vi Aroon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/vi-aroon-jttrc.md), own and operate the Spicy Brothers stall, which features rare peppers and spices. While Vi has a zest for life, Kasem is reserved and calculating. He's also the one behind the sabotage currently afflicting the Tyenmo and Xungoon stalls.

Several weeks ago, Vi told his brother he's getting married and moving to a distant land. Kasem knows he can't continue Spicy Brothers without Vi's charm and concocted a plan to buy out another successful business. But most businesses in the Dyn Singh Night Market are family shops the owners would never consider selling. While on a trip to get more stock for Spicy Brothers, Kasem encountered a trio of rare Fey creatures called [wynlings](/compendium/bestiary/fey/wynling-jttrc.md). Kasem befriended them with a few sweet fruits and brought them back to the night market. He now bribes his invisible friends with fruit to cause disruptions around Tyenmo Noodles and Xungoon Family Seafood. He doesn't want to hurt anyone, but he hopes to make life in the market uncomfortable enough that one of the families sells its shop to him for a low price.

#### Kasem's Tour

Upon meeting the characters, Kasem laments that the families can't get along. He encourages the characters not to ruin their night embroiled in politics and offers to show them around the market. If the characters accept, the tour lasts an hour, during which Kasem points out the stalls detailed at the start of the "Welcome to the Market" section. He tells the characters about the Market Games in the central plaza, describing them as a vapid tradition created to provide cheap thrills.

Kasem encourages the characters to enjoy their evening, avoid the Market Games, and stay away from vendors who give the market a bad name. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check realizes Kasem is trying to keep them from getting involved in market politics. If confronted about this, Kasem insists he just wants them to have a delightful time at the market and departs soon after.

## Market Investigations

Once the characters decide to look into the events at the Tyenmo and Xungoon shops, they're free to start their investigation. A character who visits one of the shops and spends at least 5 minutes inspecting the space can make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a successful check, the character discovers nothing unusual except for a few persimmon peels (see "Kasem's Plan" for details on the origins of these peels). A character who further investigates these fruit peels learns no stalls in the night market currently sell persimmons.

Kusa and Lamai are at their respective shops, but neither is much help to the characters' investigations. Each is convinced her rival is to blame for a string of thefts and accidents, despite having no proof. If the characters ask about these events at nearby booths, other market vendors initially claim not to have seen anything strange. If a character succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, a vendor says, "Market business isn't for outsiders. We keep our issues to ourselves." During initial investigations, other shop owners refuse to speak about the Tyenmo-Xungoon rivalry or strangeness at their stalls. Characters can learn more once they've made names for themselves in the market (see "Learning More" and "What Vendors Know").

If the characters guard or stake out either Tyenmo Noodle Bowl or Xungoon Family Seafood, no strange events unfold while they're nearby. Investigations using magic also reveal nothing out of the ordinary.

### Learning More

If the characters ask either Kusa or Lamai why their fellow vendors are loath to get involved in their investigations, the shop owner explains other vendors view the characters as outsiders. During the conversation, they mention the following points:

- The vendors probably see the characters as nosy strangers and want to protect their own.
- Reputation and being part of the market mean a lot to local vendors.
- There's an easy way to quickly get a reputation in the market: participate in the Market Games.
- The Market Games are prestigious events held at the market's center. Winners are temporary, minor celebrities throughout the market.

The shop owner speculates other vendors would view the characters as more than just visitors if they win some Market Games. See the "Market Games" section for more details.

#### Gaining Renown

Characters who participate in Market Games increase their renown among the Dyn Singh Night Market's vendors. Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0. Each player tracks their character's renown separately. Every Market Game notes how much renown characters gain by participating in or winning the event. The Dyn Singh Night Market vendors grow more willing to share information with characters as the characters' renown increases, as detailed in the "What Vendors Know" section.

### Wynling Mischief

The characters aren't the only ones roaming the night market. After each Market Game, or whenever the characters are away from the Tyenmo and Xungoon shops, roll on the Market Mischief table to see what trouble the wynlings cause.

**Market Mischief**

| dice: d4 | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | A fire at Xungoon Family Seafood causes the stall's right leg to collapse. The stall is now crooked. |
| 2 | Two dozen vanilla buns are missing from Vada's Otherworldly Goods. A trail of powdered sugar leads to Tyenmo Noodle Bowl. |
| 3 | A rain of persimmons pelts either the Tyenmo or the Xungoon shop. The owners are battered but unharmed, and persimmon juice is everywhere. |
| 4 | Gammon spots a large wok from Tyenmo Noodle Bowl at Xungoon Family Seafood. A character who examines the wok and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices the wooden handle has been gnawed by child-sized teeth. |
^market-mischief

## Market Games

The Market Games take place inside three golden tents located in the Event Grounds, which are situated in the center of the Dyn Singh Night Market. Vendors sponsor events to advertise their wares and attract visitors to the market. The current sponsor of each tent decides how its interior is arranged. The following three events are now being hosted:

Aroon Family Pepper Challenge. A test of endurance hosted by the Spicy Brothers.

Battle Prawn Challenge. A cooking competition hosted by Sid Squid of the Trusty Leek.

Hide-and-Seek Challenge. A game hosted by [Madam Kulp](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-kulp-jttrc.md)'s Silk.

### Participating in the Games

Characters who wish to participate in the Market Games need only show up at an event tent and ask to compete. The Market Games run several times throughout the evening. The rules for the three Market Games appear in the sections that follow.

Characters who win a Market Game gain 1 renown with the Dyn Singh Night Market's vendors (see the "Gaining Renown" section). As characters gain renown, the market's vendors share more information with them (see the "What Vendors Know" section). If a character participates in and loses all three Market Games, they still gain 1 renown, as locals respect their tenacity. If a character wins all three challenges, vendors are impressed and call them _reah_, which means "coals of the same fire."

### Aroon Family Pepper Challenge

The Spicy Brothers, Kasem and [Vi Aroon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/vi-aroon-jttrc.md), are energetic and eccentric lovers of all things spicy. They sponsor the Aroon Family Pepper Challenge in the southwest event tent. This test of fortitude and willpower was created by their father years ago, and it's a tradition they've kept up now that they own the family business.

One of the Spicy Brother's assistants, a human garbed in a garish red-and-green uniform, welcomes characters who seek to participate in the Aroon Family Pepper Challenge. The assistant outlines the rules:

- Participants sit at a table with a basket of mixed peppers and several pitchers of milk.
- During each of the event's three rounds, participants must select one pepper from the basket and eat it.
- Any participant who eats a pepper each round without reaching for milk or leaving the table until the three rounds are over is declared a winner.

Violence and magic are not permitted during the event, but no one checks for magic effects cast prior to the competition.

If the characters agree to the rules, the assistant asks them to wait a few moments for the next event to begin. If four or more characters choose to participate, they are the only contenders in the event. If fewer characters take part, other locals ([commoners](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) join the event from the audience, ensuring there are at least four participants.

#### Greet the Heat

After a short wait, the characters are escorted into the main area of the tent.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A crowd applauds from nearby bleachers as you're led into the broad, open space of the event tent. Before you is a square table bearing a massive basket of colorful peppers and several pitchers of milk.
> 
> "Welcome, challengers, to the Aroon Family Pepper Challenge!" shouts a bombastic announcer standing near the table and wearing a red, pepper-themed costume. "I'm your host, [Vi Aroon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/vi-aroon-jttrc.md)! Is everybody ready to Greet. The. Heat?!"
^05e

The characters are directed to sit at the table. As soon as they're seated, Vi (chaotic good, human [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) briefly recaps the rules and asks if there are any questions. Once any questions are addressed, the challenge begins.

#### Running the Challenge

The challenge unfolds over three rounds, with challengers eating their peppers one at a time, starting with the participant closest to Vi and going clockwise around the table.

On their turn during each round, each participating character must choose a pepper from the basket and eat it. The peppers are from the Spicy Brothers' unique stock, and nothing about them reveals their taste or intensity. The character must roll on the Random Spicy Pepper table to determine what sort of pepper they pull, along with any special effects that pepper has. The character must then make a Constitution saving throw. The DC depends on the pepper they chose. On a successful saving throw, they manage to eat it. On a failed saving throw, they eat the pepper but have disadvantage on the next saving throw they make during the challenge. If a character fails a saving throw by 10 or more, they either reflexively reach for milk or leave the table. Either way, they lose.

Vi offers color commentary during the event, encouraging the crowd to cheer participants and daring competitors to take dramatic bites.

**Random Spicy Pepper**

| dice: d10 | Pepper |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Dud! The pepper is not a pepper, but a cherry tomato. You do not need to make a saving throw. |
| 2–5 | Common Pepper (DC 10). This pepper has no special effects. |
| 6–7 | Sweet Heat Pepper (DC 12). The pepper is hot but delicious. You do not have disadvantage on this saving throw if you would normally have it as a result of eating another pepper. |
| 8 | Burning Waves Pepper (DC 16). The heat from this pepper comes in waves. You must make two consecutive Constitution saving throws this round against this pepper. |
| 9 | Flamethrower (DC 18). If you fail your saving throw against this pepper, you belch or gasp spice into the air. The next challenge participant to eat a pepper has disadvantage on their saving throw. |
| 10 | Skull-Face Pepper (DC 20). The spice is intense. For an instant, every participant's face looks like a skull to you. This is unsettling but has no other effect. |
^random-spicy-pepper

#### Ending the Challenge

The challenge ends when every participant is disqualified or has eaten three peppers. Winners and losers alike are rewarded with big bowls of creamy yogurt. Any character who wins the challenge gains 1 renown with the Dyn Singh Night Market's vendors.

After the challenge is completed, characters can ask Vi for information about the thefts (see the "What Vendors Know" section). Soon after the characters start questioning Vi or as they leave the tent, Kasem arrives with news regarding trouble in the market. Roll on the Market Mischief table in the "Wynling Mischief" section to determine what has transpired.

### Battle Prawn Challenge

Sid Squid's Trusty Leek sponsors Battle Prawns: The Shrimpening. Sid's shrimp cakes were voted best dish during a festival competition last year. This challenge, held in the northern event tent, tests participants' inventiveness and versatility as they prepare giant versions of his signature dish.

The tent is decorated in a nautical theme, heavy on rope decor and brass fixtures. Sid (chaotic good, human [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) and five assistants, all wearing yellow chef's outfits, eagerly invite visitors to participate in Battle Prawns. If characters ask, Sid explains the challenge is simple: assist in making a gigantic shrimp cake in record time. Participants must rapidly prepare prawn meat and chop beans for the sous-chefs. If they perform these preparations fast enough, they might complete the recipe in record time. Unless the characters specifically ask, no one mentions the unusual prawns used in this challenge (see the "Battle Arena" section).

Up to four characters may participate in the event. If fewer characters take part, some of Sid's assistants ([commoners](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) join them to create a team of four. No rules forbid magic during this event.

Characters who participate are invited to don yellow aprons that match those of Sid and Sid's assistants. The next challenge begins shortly.

#### Battle Arena

Sid's assistants lead participating characters into the main part of the tent. The arena is depicted on map 2.2. Read or paraphrase the following description as the characters enter:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Excited onlookers crowd the bleachers within this vast, open tent. One half of the space is crowded with cooking tools: a pair of oversized woks and two long cutting stations containing bundles of foot-long green beans. The other side holds a pool-sized glass tank filled with water. The water churns as large, shadowy shapes move within.
^063

The western half of the arena holds the cooking implements and ingredients needed to prepare the shrimp cakes. The eastern half contains a 10-foot-tall tank of water and several gigantic jagged koi prawns. Steps at either end lead to the top of the tank.

Participating characters are directed to take places near the preparation tables at the center of the tent. Sid welcomes the crowd and enthusiastically announces they'll prepare giant shrimp cakes—hopefully, in record time. Sid directs the audience's attention to two special ingredients: delicious green tree beans and giant, jagged koi prawns.

#### Running the Challenge

One of Sid's assistants explains what participants need to do in more detail than before: prepare a bundle of green tree beans and slay a jagged [koi prawn](/compendium/bestiary/beast/koi-prawn-jttrc.md). If the characters can perform both tasks in 6 rounds or fewer, they win the challenge. While Sid works the crowd, the assistants can answer any questions with details from this section. The assistants direct participants not to move from the preparation tables until Sid gives the signal.

##### Starting the Challenge

Once any questions are answered, Sid's sous-chefs position themselves around the large woks, ready to transform the ingredients into the final dish. Unless fewer than four characters are participating in the event, these assistants won't help to prepare the beans or the prawns. Sid leads the audience in counting down; "Three... two... one... start!" At this point, the characters and prawns should roll initiative.

##### Bean Preparation

Massive bundles of green tree beans cover both preparation tables. Participants must chop or mash the beans with the various cooking knives at the table (treat them as [daggers](/compendium/items/dagger.md)), their own tools, or other methods. Each pile is a single Small object with AC 10; hp 15; and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. A pile is rendered unusable if it takes any amount of acid, fire, lightning, necrotic, or radiant damage. Once a pile of beans is reduced to 0 hit points, the sous-chefs add the prepared beans to the woks.

##### Prawn Preparation

The large tank contains four 8-foot-long jagged koi prawns (use the [giant sea horse](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-sea-horse.md) stat block). Participants must slay one of the prawns. Waiting sous-chefs then fish the prawn out and drag it to a wok. The prawns are not initially hostile but defend themselves if they take damage. They have half cover from any creature attacking from outside the water.

If the prawns reduce a character to 0 or fewer hit points, Sid ends the challenge while the sous-chefs get any wounded participants to safety.

#### Ending the Challenge

The challenge ends when participants complete both tasks, give up, or are defeated by the prawns. If the characters fail at either preparation, Sid's assistants complete the preparations and then cook and serve the giant shrimp cakes.

If the participants completed both tasks in 6 rounds or fewer, the shrimp cakes are made in record time. Characters who participated in the challenge gain 1 renown with the Dyn Singh Night Market's vendors. If the challenge took longer than 6 rounds, Sid's crew and the audience remain in high spirits as they eat the delicious shrimp cakes, but the characters gain no renown.

As Sid thanks the characters for participating, trouble befalls the market vendors. Roll on the Market Mischief table earlier in the adventure to determine what happens.

### Hide-and-Seek Challenge

The Hide-and-Seek Challenge is sponsored by [Madam Kulp](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-kulp-jttrc.md), who creates luxurious fashions from silk spun by tut-krogh caterpillars. Her event takes place in the eastern event tent. This challenge doesn't have an audience.

When the characters enter the tent, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Seated at the middle of this sizable empty tent is a wizened gnome at work amid tangles of colorful yarn. Several fuzzy, kitten-sized blue caterpillars drowse on her, nestled in her clothing and hair. The gnome peers up and says, "Welcome! I am [Madam Kulp](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-kulp-jttrc.md). Are you here to play hide-and-seek with my gentle friends?"
^06a

[Madam Kulp](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-kulp-jttrc.md) is an elderly gnome woman (neutral [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)). If the characters accept her challenge, she hops up and opens a trapdoor at the center of the tent. A ladder descends into a dark, messy room full of boxes and furniture.

[Madam Kulp](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-kulp-jttrc.md) explains that below are a series of rooms where several tut-krogh caterpillars (use the [lizard](/compendium/bestiary/beast/lizard.md) stat block) are hiding. Her challenge is simple: descend the ladder and bring back four caterpillars within 1 minute. Any number of characters may participate, and they may use magical assistance as long as the caterpillars aren't harmed—[Madam Kulp](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-kulp-jttrc.md) is adamant about the caterpillars' safety. If the characters agree to these rules, they may descend into the maze when they are ready.

#### Running the Challenge

Once the characters have descended the ladder, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The ladder descends into a dimly lit room smelling of dust and sweet spices. Musty furniture and crates are strewn about the space. A door leads north.
^06c

The challenge area is depicted on map 2.2 and includes seven rooms. Unlocked doors connect the spaces, all of which are filled with colorful but worthless clutter. The doors are rickety and fit loosely in their frames, allowing tut-krogh caterpillars to move between the rooms unimpeded. Area H1 is lit by a lantern shedding "dim light"; the other areas are dark.

##### Starting the Challenge

When the last character reaches the bottom of the ladder, [Madam Kulp](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-kulp-jttrc.md) shouts, "Ready? Go!" At this point, the characters should roll initiative.

##### Finding Caterpillars

Four tut-krogh caterpillars hide among the cluttered rooms, one each in areas H3, H4, H5, and H7. A character can determine whether there is a caterpillar in a room by spending an action and succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

##### Collecting Caterpillars

Once a character finds a tut-krogh, they can convince the caterpillar to come with them by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check. Alternatively, a character can grab a caterpillar by succeeding on a DC 12 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. A caterpillar flees to an adjoining room if attacked or if a character tries to grab it and misses.

#### Ending the Challenge

The challenge ends either when the characters bring the four caterpillars to area H1 or after 10 rounds pass, whichever occurs first.

If the characters successfully complete the challenge, the shop owner is delighted and declares them winners. Any character who participated in the challenge gains 1 renown with the Dyn Singh Night Market's vendors.

If the characters fail, [Madam Kulp](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-kulp-jttrc.md) invites them into the tent and commiserates that tut-krogh caterpillars are tricky creatures. She invites the characters to try her challenge again later.

Soon after leaving the tent, the characters learn a misfortune has befallen a market vendor. Roll on the Market Mischief table to determine what transpired.

### Character Advancement

The characters all gain a level after group members participate in the three Market Games. If they don't complete three Market Games, characters gain a level once they reveal Kasem is the source of the disruptions at Tyenmo Noodles and Xungoon Family Seafood.

## What Vendors Know

Vendors in the Dyn Singh Night Market know a great deal about the market's inner workings, their fellow shop owners, and daily gossip. While they're typically polite, they share little information with strangers. If characters gain renown by winning Market Games, the following vendors share the facts for the renown values equal to (and lower than) the renown of the character conversing with them. See the "Gaining Renown" section for additional details.

### Vi Aroon

Kasem's twin and co-owner of Spicy Brothers, [Vi Aroon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/vi-aroon-jttrc.md), loves what he does. He knows nothing about Kasem's plans but can be convinced to share the gossip on the What [Vi Aroon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/vi-aroon-jttrc.md) Knows table.

^what-other-vendors-know

## Revealing the Plot

After the characters complete a few Market Games and make inquires around the market, they likely learn the following facts:

- No one has seen members of either the Tyenmo family or the Xungoon family sabotaging the other family's stand.
- Vi is leaving the market, making Kasem's future uncertain.
- Kasem is behaving strangely and seems fixated on the Tyenmo and Xungoon stands.

If the characters take information pointing toward Kasem to either Lamai or Kusa, the aggrieved vendor listens but remains fixated on her rival. Neither believes someone else is responsible unless the culprit confesses, the characters present accounts from other vendors, or the characters reveal a wynling.

### Investigating Kasem

If the characters suspect Kasem of inflaming the Tyenmo-Xungoon rivalry, they might investigate him further. The brothers have a tent for storing supplies and conducting business next to their Spicy Brothers stall. Characters who visit the shop can slip into the tent by succeeding on a DC 12 Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. The tent contains business records, cots for both brothers, a large crate marked "peppers" that holds three straw-lined bird cages, and a box of persimmons.

Kasem used the cages to smuggle the wynlings into the market, and the creatures use them as tiny homes. Persimmons are rare in the market, but they are one of the wynlings' favorite foods. Kasem uses the fruit to encourage the wynlings to harass his targets, promising them the treats when they do good work or stashing them in other vendors' stalls. While the cages and fruit aren't enough evidence of Kasem's wrongdoing on their own, they might help the characters reveal Kasem's plot.

### Revealing the Wynlings

The characters might suspect Kasem is using a creature to harass the Tyenmo and Xungoon market stands—either due to stories from vendors or from what they've witnessed themselves. If a character casts [detect evil and good](/compendium/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) near one of the sabotaged stalls, it reveals the presence of a Fey creature nearby, a [wynling](/compendium/bestiary/fey/wynling-jttrc.md) drowsing on a nearby stall roof. If approached, the wynling turns [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) and flees.

A character can convince a wynling to reveal itself by going to either Tyenmo Noodles or Xungoon Family Seafood and holding out a persimmon. Doing so causes at least one wynling to appear and try to take the fruit. A character can befriend a wynling once it reveals itself by succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If characters who can speak and understand Sylvan ask the wynling questions, the Fey creature squeaks the following details in reply:

- Kasem found the wynlings in the nearby mountains and brought them to the market recently.
- The wynlings live with their friend Kasem at the Spicy Brothers tent.
- Kasem offers the wynlings persimmons to do errands and to play in certain places (usually the Tyenmo and Xungoon stalls).
- The wynlings aren't malicious; they're just playful and really like persimmons.

The wynlings have no loyalty to Kasem, but they also don't understand why anything they've done is wrong. If the characters show the wynlings to Lamai or Kusa, the vendor is surprised and wants to know why the wynlings are harassing her. The wynlings explain they've only done what Kasem asked them to—thinking it was all good fun. If Kasem is confronted with the wynlings, the creatures are clearly friendly with him. Kasem then confesses he sowed discord between the Tyenmo and Xungoon families to make it easier to buy their stalls.

### Confronting Kasem

If characters challenge Kasem with details they learned about him from local vendors, he laughs them off, explaining the market is full of gossip. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check realizes Kasem is hiding something. If the characters confront Kasem with multiple accounts or pieces of evidence, they can coax a confession from him (see the following section). If characters take a more hostile approach, Kasem defends himself. Kasem has the statistics of a [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) and calls out to three [wynlings](/compendium/bestiary/fey/wynling-jttrc.md) (presented at the end of this adventure), who appear and aid him.

#### Convincing Kasem to Confess

The characters can convince Kasem to confess by presenting all three of the following rumors to Kasem—or presenting two and succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check; if the characters do so, Kasem then confesses to everything in the "Kasem's Plan" section:

- **Brother Leaving.** If a character asks Kasem about his brother leaving the market, he grows agitated and notes that he's felt betrayed by his brother since Vi decided to abandon their business.
- **Buying Businesses.** If a character presses Kasem about him buying either Tyenmo Noodles or Xungoon Family Seafood, he explains he's looking out for his future. He doesn't care that there's no precedent for buying a family business.
- **Strange Pets.** If asked about the cages and fruit in the Spicy Brothers tent or reports of him having a strange pet, Kasem grows flustered and claims he's thinking about getting a parrot.

### Rivals Explode

If the party fails at the Market Games or reaches dead ends in its investigations, the Tyenmo-Xungoon rivalry comes to a head when Lamai and Kusa get into a public scrap at one of their stands. While the shop vendors fight, any character can make a DC 12 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check to notice Kasem watching with a smile. Not realizing he's being watched, Kasem offers a persimmon to something unseen on his shoulder and the fruit rapidly vanishes. Characters who confront Kasem with what they saw and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check convince him to confess to everything in the "Kasem's Plan" section.

## Conclusion

The adventure ends when Kasem's plot—and potentially the wynlings—are revealed to Lamai or Kusa. If the characters haven't already confronted Kasem, Lamai or Kusa finds him and publicly accuses him of sabotaging her stall. If the vendors are backed up by the characters, witness claims, and evidence, Kasem quickly confesses. Market guards usher Kasem from the market and forbid him from returning unless the characters intercede on his behalf. If the characters advocate for Kasem, another vendor offers to adopt him into their family if he promises no more deceit.

In the aftermath, Kusa and Lamai are quick to apologize to one another and reconcile their differences. They thank the party and award the characters 100 gp and a lifetime of meals from their stalls.

## Siabsungkoh Gazetteer

Amid a vivid patchwork of rural farms and dense mountain jungles stands the bustling, unforgettable Dyn Singh Night Market. The heart of the valley of Siabsungkoh, this regional market attracts visitors from distant lands with delicious foods, rare treasures, and all manner of unpredictable fortunes. Tourists nicknamed this ever-changing district the "Dancing Night Market" due to its festive atmosphere and the colorful displays of magical lights that illuminate vendors' wares.

Beyond Siabsungkoh's regional market district, lush jungles are home to rare plants and animals, including the famous bioluminescent lau-pop flower. These flowers bathe the mountains nightly in soft, blue-purple light. Well-kept roads crisscross the region, connecting the populous Dyn Singh Night Market with the scattered communities of the Outer Edges, which border the mountains.

Tradition, trade, and enterprise influence culture in Siabsungkoh. Families spend generations cultivating reputations as experts in varied trades or fields. The inner workings of the markets where families meet and trade are complicated, rife with competition and alliances. Rival families occasionally clash with one another; their conflicts typically take the form of insults and rumor-mongering, but sometimes escalate to violent scuffles. Some traditionalists fear losing their cultural identity and connection to the natural world, and they wish to disrupt the growing impact of mercantilism on local life.

### Siabsungkoh Features

Those familiar with Siabsungkoh know the following details:

- **Hallmarks.** Siabsungkoh is a land known for its cosmopolitan markets and its people's tight family bonds and ties to nature.
- **People.** Siabsungkoh is a cosmopolitan area inhabited mainly by humans with dark, wavy-to-curly hair, brown eyes, and skin tones varying from medium tan to deep brown. Alongside humans, dragonborn, gnomes, kobolds, and orcs number among the land's most populous residents.
- **Languages.** Maynah, which translates to "river tongue," is the native language of Siabsungkoh. Most locals also speak Common and Draconic.

### Noteworthy Sites

Siabsungkoh features lush, tropical jungles surrounded by mountains. The valley is small but buzzes with energy, as both locals and tourists frequent the markets that serve as a hub of community life.

#### Dyn Singh Night Market

Traders from Siabsungkoh's scattered communities flock nightly to the Dyn Singh Night Market, an ever-changing, town-sized market. Food vendors take center stage, selling noodles, seafood, pot stickers, and other delicacies from colorful stalls and carts. Visitors might sample fine desserts, seek the expert works of artisan families, or be entertained by groups like the folklore-sharing Dancers of Smoke.

Becoming a vendor at the Dyn Singh Night Market involves gaining the favor of the five oldest families of Siabsungkoh, then paying a large fee to "prove success." While this approval process was initially created to prevent corruption, many would-be vendors spend years saving for the fee even after earning the families' favor. Many older families have grown greedy and try to stifle competition from new vendors.

#### Outer Edges

The region of Siabsungkoh that borders the wilderness, the Outer Edges are overgrown with lush greenery and lau-pop flowers. Many of the scattered communities here and across the valley reject the bureaucracy and crowds of the market district, braving the dangers of the nearby wilderness to stay self-sufficient. Merchants not accepted in the Dyn Singh Night Market do business here, some trading in doubtful goods and sinister magic. For example, the Nyvrn Candy Cart sells an array of magical and cursed candies, while Hiccup's Generally Nice Goods barters "discounted" Sangarian rugs and "semi-genuine" painted porcelain from the Yongjing.

Some Outer Edges residents chase knowledge of the natural world, such as the scholarly Preed family, whose members believe the land has grown angry and will soon swallow Siabsungkoh whole.

#### Avyrn Mountain

Centuries ago, a young sorcerer named Phi Maymoon scaled Avyrn Mountain and pleaded with the nature spirits there to protect Siabsungkoh from invaders. Locals who believe this legend climb the mountain and leave offerings of food and drink on the cliffside to show respect and provide nourishment to the sorcerer. They believe Phi's pact with the spirits protects them still.

Beyond this memorial is the domain of the mountain's spirits. The mountain guardian, Saan, resides within a cave at the mountain's top. It is said the bonds of friendship are tested within Saan's cave. Explorers who prove true to their friends and family are blessed; those who don't find their relationships shattered.

### Life in Siabsungkoh

The following truths are known to those who live in Siabsungkoh or travel through these lands.

#### Dyn Singh Merchant Collective

The finest merchant families in Siabsungkoh make up the Dyn Singh Merchant Collective. These families worked for generations to grow their businesses' reputations and the quality of their wares. The collective sets laws for trade throughout the land, issues licensing for harvesting natural resources, and establishes the rules of business in the night market. However, their success pushes some greedy members of the collective to keep the group exclusive so they can maintain their own power.

#### The Five Families

Siabsungkoh is ruled by the heads of the land's five oldest families, three of which are members of the Dyn Singh Merchant Collective. In recent years, the government has expanded the market further to encourage greater trade opportunities. This pushed the market into the center of local life, rankling traditionalists and causing many to believe the nation is sacrificing its ties to the natural world.

#### Family First

Siabsungkoh is a collectivist society centered on family and deep group loyalties. Families are often blended and can grow through marriage, through adoption, or by simply choosing to accept someone as a family member. Found families are equal to traditional families and often adopt a family name or symbol. The first families that settled Siabsungkoh are said to have been of different blood but the same spirit. Those who operate alone through choice or act in self-serving ways are often called _tuah_, which means "of lonely heart."

#### Visitors Welcome

Siabsungkoh's people have a reputation for being friendly and welcoming; however, trust is reserved for those who earn it. Locals are overly polite and use double-speak when addressing strangers. Newcomers who learn the customs and work within the cultural framework, however, can earn places and renown within the communities.

#### Spirits of the Land

Most Siabsungkoh residents deeply appreciate nature and the spirits that inhabit it. Individuals often leave cut mangoes in streams as offerings for the nature spirits, or spend time at the Lynx River or Slumber Pond to meditate on reflections in the water. Some forgo the duties of family, seeking to attune with nature and work the will of the spirits at the Temple of Ember.

Many animals are believed to be messengers of the spirits. Of particular mystical prominence are tut-krogh caterpillars—which create stunning iridescent silk before they transform into tea-moths—and pangolins, which are said to comfort souls in times of hardship.

#### Names

Names in Siabsungkoh are shaped by family identity, class, and trade. The following names are among the most common in Siabsungkoh:

- **Feminine.** Aom, Pathma, Ratari, Suree, Tunlaya
- **Masculine.** Arthit, Chon, Kiet, Prasong, Somboon, Tai, Teera
- **Gender-Neutral.** Aryn, Detch, Makok, Phi, Rune, Vyndr, Wayo
- **Surnames.** Dunedow, Jollion, Myahkoon, Rhusaang, Suwan

### Legends of Siabsungkoh

The oldest legend of Siabsungkoh tells of a young sorcerer, Phi Maymoon, who made a pact with nature spirits to protect Siabsungkoh from invaders that were closing in from the west and south. In an act of desperation, Phi climbed Avyrn Mountain and pleaded with the spirits to protect the land's people. The spirits answered Phi's call. With their combined power, they shifted the earth around Siabsungkoh to form jagged mountains that blocked the invasion. This exchange of power was not without a cost—Phi traded their life to form the barrier that protects Siabsungkoh. Phi's magical power lives on in the mountains and is supposedly the force that gives lau-pop flowers their remarkable glow. To this day, many honor the spirits of Siabsungkoh by tending gardens of lau-pop flowers or climbing Avyrn Mountain to leave offerings to Phi.

### Characters from Siabsungkoh

If players want to create characters from Siabsungkoh, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**What is your family known for?** Are you artisans, chefs, outcasts, or something else? What sort of reputation does your family have?

**What have you done or refused to do in the name of your family?** Did this protect your family or yourself? Did this change your relationship with your family?

**What is your connection to the Dyn Singh Night Market**? Does your family have the favor of the families that run the market? What do you look forward to buying whenever you visit? Do you oppose the market's expansion or welcome it?

## Wynling

Playful and mischievous, wynlings defend mountain heights and alpine vales against trespassers. A wynling rarely engages a threat directly, preferring to deter intruders by harassing them with thefts and pranks. Many travelers return from lands protected by wynlings with stories of vanishing equipment and curious eyes staring from the shadows.

Wynlings typically live on the mountains they protect, but they often venture into nearby settlements, lured by high-spirited music and sweet foods. Away from their open, wild homes, wynlings cause all manner of mysterious accidents.
