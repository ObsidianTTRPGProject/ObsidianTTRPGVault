_An Adventure for 3rd-Level Characters_

Every year, the Awakening Festival draws folk from across the rich expanse known as Godsbreath, uniting celebrants as they tell their history in song and set the course for the upcoming year. But the mood turns grim when a group of farmers suddenly turns violent, manipulated by an unknown magical malady. In the aftermath, well-known trader [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) fears for her goddaughter [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md)—a worker at the farm the attackers came from, deep within the outlying farmlands known as the Rattle. When the characters investigate, they are pitted against a lurking evil that uses a young woman's grief and loneliness to lure new victims.

## Background

Life in Godsbreath revolves around community and agriculture, with locals working hard to feed themselves and keep their land strong. But as the crimson-tinged farmland known as the Ribbon becomes less fertile each year, groups of young farmers and adventurers have begun to plant crops along the dangerous borderlands called the Rattle. Despite the constant threat of monstrous predators, new volunteers keep working in the Rattle to help provide for their people. If the bounty of the Ribbon continues to fade, learning to survive in the Rattle will prove vital to supporting Godsbreath's people.

But the Rattle is home to more than feral beasts. A nightmarish Undead known as a soul shaker has risen from these bloody lands, targeting a young worker named [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) at a remote farm.

### Fractured Soul

An evil Undead called a [soul shaker](/compendium/bestiary/undead/soul-shaker-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) manipulates many of the events in this story. Its origin and objectives are tied to one of the most infamous hauntings in Godsbreath.

Stories tell that Cradlelace Lake was once a thriving but isolated farm, home to a large, happy family. But during a terrible storm, a sinkhole swallowed the farmhouse, then flooded, drowning the house in brackish muck. Tales say the house's residents struggled to escape the pit, but the farm's owner—desperate to keep her family with her—dragged them back into the sinking house. In the aftermath, when neighbors arrived at the sinkhole's edge, they found six pairs of severed, Undead hands struggling to escape the muddy water.

In the years that followed, more tragedies befell those who came near Cradlelace Lake, as if the buried dead sought to add to their number. Among those lost was a young man named Culley, who vanished into the water in front of his friend [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md).

Unlike most lost to the lake, Culley eventually emerged—at least, part of him did. A single Undead hand escaped the lake, and it eventually found others of its kind known as crawling claws. Gradually, these unthinking Undead combined into a soul shaker. Although the mind of this new horror was a fractured amalgam of thoughts, it remembered the lost soul named Culley, whose memories were the seed of its being. It also remembered the last living person Culley ever saw, his dear friend [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md).

Driven by instinct, shattered memories, and the discordant urges of dozens of tiny Undead, the soul shaker grew in power, then sought out its old friend.

^godsbreath-pronunciations

### Setting the Adventure

Use the following suggestions to help contextualize Godsbreath in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters traveling from the Radiant Citadel arrive in Godsbreath about a mile outside Promise. If you wish to further detail this land, use the "Promise Gazetteer" section at this adventure's end as a departure point.
- **Forgotten Realms.** Godsbreath could be a region in Turmish, with Promise replacing Alaghôn or Nonthal. Godsbreath could also be part of Featherdale in the Dalelands, adding its distinctive agricultural bent to this rural dale.
- **Ravenloft.** All of Godsbreath could be a Domain of Dread. The Darklord of this domain might be a member of the family lost at Cradlelace Lake or the vengeful spirit of Culley.

### Character Hooks

The characters might become involved in the dangers affecting Godsbreath in any of the following ways:

- **Awakening Festival.** The characters come to Promise, Godsbreath's largest settlement, for the Awakening Festival, either accompanying traders or at a connection's invitation. This annual celebration is marked by the multiday Awakening Song, a communal retelling of the land's history and a memorial to those who've passed on.
- **Friends of Kianna.** One or more characters are childhood friends of [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md), a good-natured young woman who goes missing in the course of the adventure. They've received a strange message from her inviting them to Promise, but when they arrive, she's nowhere to be found.
- **Honored Guests.** A trader the characters have had past dealings with—perhaps from the Radiant Citadel or the Dyn Singh Night Market—invites the characters to Promise to participate in a business deal with [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md).

## Starting the Adventure

The adventure begins when the characters arrive in the town of Promise or, if they are already there, as they explore the Awakening Festival. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> In the town of Promise, the annual Awakening Festival is underway, and the streets are alive with vibrant music. As the history of the land is recounted through song, musicians play instruments of many kinds. Their performances meld together as passersby join in during choruses, uniting the entire community in a single collective celebration.
^096

Anyone on the streets of Promise during the Awakening Festival hears what the locals call the _Awakening Song_, a collection of songs recounting local histories. Characters who spend an hour exploring the festival learn much about the history of the land. They also have advantage on Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) checks related to the _Awakening Song_ made for the rest of the adventure.

During the festival, stalls throughout the community sell local crafts, musical instruments, and street foods. Small straw dolls wearing colorful shirts and dresses are widely available for 5 cp each. A doll can be made to resemble the buyer for 7 cp. The dolls are a popular local craft and nothing more.

### Eyes of Blood

After the characters have engaged with the local festival as much as they please, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score notices a group of celebrants acting strangely. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> As part of the crowd begins another verse of the _Awakening Song_, four people wearing the garb of farm folk wander into their midst. Rather than singing, they stare blankly. Then they surge forward into the celebrants, raising rusty farming implements.
^098

Four farmers attack the festival-goers. They use the [cultist](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) stat block; their rusty, bladed farming implements have the same statistics as scimitars. Any character who engages the farmers sees their eyes swirl with crimson, resembling bloody, unshed teardrops. Characters have no way of knowing it yet, but this is a mark of the soul shaker's control (see the "Soul Shaker" section at the end of this adventure).

The festival-goers closest to the strange farmers panic and flee. Unless the characters do the same, the attackers target them.

Only one local holds their ground: a surprised woman named [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) ([commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)). She clearly recognizes some of the strange farmers and tries to reason with them to no avail. [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) shouts for the characters not to kill the farmers, noting that they're not behaving like themselves.

#### Memories of Death

When the last [farmer](/compendium/bestiary/npc/farmer-jttrc.md) is defeated, locals return to tend to the wounded. The farmers are known to many in the crowd, prompting confusion over their strange appearance and what caused them to attack. Talk of curses begins to spread.

##### Investigating the Farmers

A character who fought the farmers or examines them afterward can make a DC 13 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check. On a success, the character can tell the farmers are being magically controlled. Spells like [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) also reveal that the farmers are surrounded by an aura of enchantment magic. While this magic—the effects of the soul shaker's [geas](/compendium/spells/geas.md) spell—lingers, the farmers' eyes keep their crimson hue.

If the farmers are healed or roused from unconsciousness, they refuse to speak. They don't attack again, but the locals keep them restrained.

The characters likely don't have the resources to remove the enchantment affecting the farmers yet—only destroying the soul shaker or waiting approximately a month can do this. Even if the characters do remove the effect, the farmers are confused and remember nothing helpful.

##### Strange Parchment

As the characters investigate the situation, [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) notices that one of the farmers was clutching a crumpled sheet of parchment. She opens it, and nearby characters hear her curse in concerned shock. [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) hands the crumpled parchment to any character who asks about it. It bears a charcoal sketch of a child struggling to swim in dark water while being grasped at by hands beneath the surface.

#### Aunt Dellie

Aunt Delanore "Dellie" Godsen (neutral good, human [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) is a savvy operator with an honest reputation, a soft heart, and a talent for hearing a bit about everyone's business. A trader and skimmer boat pilot, [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) has never been afraid to go her own way and knows much about Godsbreath's lands and threats. Although she's a small woman, [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md)'s charm and knack for survival have gotten her through numerous near disasters. Everyone calls her "aunt," a trend started by her beloved goddaughter [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md).

##### Personality Trait

"Tell the truth of where you've been, and I'll let you know where you ought to be going."

##### Ideal

"I'll make trouble for trouble itself if that's what it takes to make someone smile."

##### Bond

"A place is the people you meet—and the ones you help along the way."

##### Flaw

"Nothing short of a god is going to take me down."

#### A Godmother's Fear

[Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) clearly recognizes the sketch on the parchment one of the strange farmers had with them. Her strong voice shakes as she explains its significance:

- The sketch was drawn by [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md)'s goddaughter, [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md). [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) knows her art style, and this is a scene she draws regularly.
- As a child, [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) saw her friend Culley drown in Cradlelace Lake while they were playing.
- Since Culley's death, [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) has used art to work through the sadness and guilt she carries to this day.
- [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) is currently working a farm in the Rattle—a half-day's travel from Promise. She was due to return to town for the Awakening Festival, but [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) hasn't seen her yet.

Characters who investigate further and ask those nearby about the attack learn that the strange farmers all worked in the Rattle—a dangerous but fertile farming region haunted by deadly predators.

While the locals speculate about the fates of other farmers in the Rattle, [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) has no patience for debates on what to do next. [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) implores the characters to go to the Rattle where [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) was working and make sure her goddaughter is safe, while she stays in Promise to organize a larger investigation. She offers the party 100 gp to undertake this mission, and 100 gp more if the characters return her goddaughter to Promise safely.

[Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) gives the characters directions to the Rattle, but she doesn't know exactly where [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md)'s farm is. The characters must search for it once they reach the Rattle.

### An Unexpected Offer

After the characters finish their conversation with [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md), another local approaches them. Read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A broad-shouldered woman wearing a multicolored dress that complements her dark skin approaches boldly, sizing you up from beneath a stylish hat. "I overheard your conversation with [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md). You see, nothing important gets past [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md). I hear you're bound for the Rattle? Excellent—I'll accompany you. We should depart at once."
^0a3

#### Lady Dre

[Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) (chaotic good, human [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)) is a trader who makes an impression on everyone she meets. Tall and broad with shoulder-length locs, she's known for bright-colored clothing meant to catch the eye of potential business partners. She's a shrewd negotiator, thanks in no small part to her storytelling skill. Personable but focused, [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) is willing to forgo short-term gains in favor of long-term growth.

##### Personality Trait

"Half of business is showmanship, and I love to take center stage."

##### Ideal

"Trades are like people—uniquely beautiful if appreciated properly."

##### Bond

"Every deal is a promise, and I always keep my promises."

##### Flaw

"It's okay if you lose, as long as I'm winning."

#### Business Concerns

[Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) was horrified by the attack, and she wants to make sure no other folk in the Rattle are in danger. Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check recognize her motivations are not entirely altruistic. If pressed, [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) admits she has made trade investments with several Rattle farms. She wants to ensure that no threats interfere with her getting first pick of the harvest.

If the characters are reluctant to allow [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) to accompany them, she tries to win them over by offering the use of her horses and a comfortable wagon. She remarks that if the characters are going to head into a mystery, they should be prepared to transport anyone who might have been harmed or afflicted.

If the characters choose not to travel with [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md), she accepts their choice and heads out on her own soon after they do.

### The Larger Truth

As the characters prepare for their journey, a human in scholars' garb approaches them. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the human as a Proclaimer of the Covenant, a servant of the pantheon of local deities who seeks new stories for the _Awakening Song_.

#### Proclaimer Tungsten Ward

Proclaimer [Tungsten Ward](/compendium/bestiary/npc/tungsten-ward-jttrc.md) (lawful good, human [acolyte](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md)) is small of stature and soft of voice, and their worldly appearance belies their young years. Despite Ward's relaxed demeanor, their approachability covers a calculating personality. Thanks to Ward's history of making friends, trading favors, and pulling strings, even rivals find the Proclaimer difficult to directly oppose. Ward seeks evidence of the gods' influence and motives in all things. Ward then adds such evidence to their orders' records and creates new verses of the _Awakening Song_.

##### Personality Trait

"I listen for the words you dare not say."

##### Ideal

"I'll know more about the gods than the gods themselves."

##### Bond

"The Proclaimers of the Covenant know what story needs to be told."

##### Flaw

"I don't really care if you believe—I care if you obey."

#### For the Record

Proclaimer Ward introduces themself and briefly explains that they research magical manifestations across Godsbreath that they believe are signs of the gods' power—or challenges to it. Having witnessed the attack and spoken with locals in the aftermath, Ward wants to join the characters' expedition. The Proclaimer hopes to investigate what led to the farmers' strange behavior and determine whether it's linked to other misfortunes in the region, like the waning crop yields in the Ribbon. If the results are significant enough to weave into the _Awakening Song_, Ward assures the party that each character's name will feature prominently.

## To the Rattle

The farm [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) works at is 12 miles from Promise. Whether the characters are traveling by foot or using [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md)'s wagon, at a normal pace it takes half a day to reach the Rattle.

Once the characters are underway, read or paraphrase the following to summarize the journey:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The journey from Promise leads north through the Ribbon, where clustered farmhouses dot the dark-red ground between stands of scattered woods. Eventually, the road dwindles to a track. The stands of trees grow denser and the farms fewer and farther between as you near the lands called the Rattle.
^0b2

Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check notices that many of the farms in the Ribbon are touched by blight and the animals are thin. Either [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) or Proclaimer Ward can explain that agriculture in the region has been deteriorating for years, forcing locals to farm the Rattle despite its dangers.

If the characters stop at any of the farms they pass in the Ribbon, they see no sign of danger, but no one at the farms knows [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md).

### Last Stop

As the characters push into the Rattle, they near a weathered farm surrounded by crops that look healthier than those they saw in the Ribbon. Not everything about the farm is hopeful, though:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Growls and excited yipping resound from the field surrounding a nearby farm. The source isn't clear, but from the motion of the tall crops, something moves swiftly through the fields parallel to the road.
^0b4

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check realizes two groups are moving through the fields, one in pursuit of the other, though the dense crops block their view. Characters who enter the fields find visibility reduced to 10 feet. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check finds the trail of whatever just moved through the fields and can easily follow it.

#### Savage Scavengers

If the characters follow the movement through the field, they come to a clearing and see an old [farmer](/compendium/bestiary/npc/farmer-jttrc.md) fleeing three horse-sized coyotes. The [farmer](/compendium/bestiary/npc/farmer-jttrc.md) is about 30 feet ahead of the coyotes. If the characters didn't enter the fields, a moment later, an old man stumbles from amid the crops and falls into the road. Three massive coyotes are soon upon him. In either case, the old man has no hope of defending himself against the creatures.

Massive coyotes are a persistent threat in the Rattle. The three coyotes use the [dire wolf](/compendium/bestiary/beast/dire-wolf.md) stat block, while the [farmer](/compendium/bestiary/npc/farmer-jttrc.md) they pursue is a [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md). A coyotes flees if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer.

If they're with the party, [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) and Proclaimer Ward try to pull the [farmer](/compendium/bestiary/npc/farmer-jttrc.md) out of danger while the characters fend off the coyotes.

When the fighting ends, the [farmer](/compendium/bestiary/npc/farmer-jttrc.md) is bloodied but angrier at the animals than scared. He thanks the characters and introduces himself as Uncle Polder.

#### Uncle Polder

Uncle Polder (neutral good, human [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) is an old man with a stocky build and an easy smile. He walks at an amble and speaks with a drawl—but his mind is constantly working, developing solutions to any problem he faces. Polder has spent many seasons in the Rattle and is dedicated to helping others thrive—in part to rid himself of the guilt of leaving a friend behind when he escaped a bulette attack during his first season.

##### Personality Trait

"If I can't get it done, I know someone who can."

##### Ideal

"Everyone's life is worth saving."

##### Bond

"I understand what it is to survive the Rattle—and what you can leave behind there."

##### Flaw

"I'm all about helping the community, as long as I get the credit."

#### Life in the Rattle

Following the battle, Uncle Polder thanks the characters and asks what brings them out this way. He invites them to water their horses and refresh themselves, gesturing to his nearby farm.

Uncle Polder's house is typical of farmhouses in the Ribbon and the Rattle—a wood-frame, single-story building with a large porch, bounded by trees. The other farmhouses in the surrounding part of the Rattle are all part of the same pact—a communal collection of farms whose inhabitants live, work, and share with each other. Uncle Polder's farmhouse is one of the largest in the group, suggesting his importance to the community.

Uncle Polder is glad to answer any questions the characters have about the area. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- There's always trouble in the Rattle, but Uncle Polder can't recall any unusual problems this season.
- He's met [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) and knows the farm she works at, though it's part of another pact. It's not far from Uncle Polder's, but people in the Rattle mostly stick close to home. The farmers of the two pacts don't interact often.
- Uncle Polder recalls helping [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md)'s pact set up early in the season. He keeps an eye out for people who might not be a good fit for life in the Rattle—and [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) seemed to have things on her mind other than farming.
- When [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) and others of her pact came to Uncle Polder's pact a couple weeks ago to trade for tools, she seemed to be embracing life in the Rattle. She spoke of how happy she was that someone named Culley was coming to join her soon. Uncle Polder assumed Culley was another worker coming late to the farm.

From their conversation with [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md), the characters remember that Culley was [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md)'s friend who drowned many years ago. If Proclaimer Ward is with the group, Ward also recalls the story of the child's death, as the Proclaimer was responsible for adding Culley's drowning to the _Awakening Song_.

If told the truth about Culley, Uncle Polder is surprised; [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) spoke as if Culley were a close and current friend.

Uncle Polder allows the characters to rest at his home as long as they please. When they're ready to go, he gives them detailed directions to the farm [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) works at a few miles away.

## Fallen Farmhouse

As the characters continue on their journey, they notice the environment changing around them after only another hour of travel. After they've traveled about a mile from Uncle Polder's home, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The open fields have all but vanished behind sparse woods at the far edge of the Rattle. The air smells stagnant and carries the taste of metal. Through the trees, multiple small farmhouses hunch amid a patch of green fields.
> 
> Suddenly the ground begins to shake, causing the road ahead to ripple, but just as quickly as it started, the shaking fades away.
^0bd

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check realizes the tremor likely wasn't an earthquake but something local, such as a collapsing cave or something moving underground. [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) and Proclaimer Ward have never heard of earthquakes in the Rattle, but they know that [bulettes](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) occasionally trouble local farmers.

### Sinister Sinkhole

After another 10 minutes of travel, another tremor shakes the ground. This time, the tremor causes a 10-foot-square, 10-foot-deep sinkhole to open beneath [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md)'s wagon (or a random character if [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) isn't with the party). Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 10 feet, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. Characters who said they would be mindful of sinkholes or unstable ground after the previous tremor have advantage on this saving throw.

Any creature at the bottom of the hole finds they're not alone. Four [crawling claws](/compendium/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw.md) scrabble free from the dirt at the bottom of the pit and attack any creatures within. After the Undead are dispatched, any character who examines the disembodied hands and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check can tell that the creatures were digging through the loose earth—though it's not clear to what end.

If [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) is accompanying the characters, her wagon is now trapped within the sinkhole. [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) decides to stay and figure out a way to get the wagon unstuck—she has rope in the back that might prove helpful. She insists the characters go on ahead. Proclaimer Ward stays to help [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) if they're both with the party.

### X Marks the Spot

The farming community [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) is a part of isn't just one farm, but a cooperative of adjacent farms. As the characters reach the location Uncle Polder directed them to, they find seven farmhouses, each about an eighth of a mile apart.

As the characters approach the nearest farm, they find the surrounding fields overgrown and the plants rotting. Crows flit between perches on the fences, but there are no signs of people.

Nearly all the houses have been sloppily painted with a large and muddy red _X_. The interiors of these farmhouses are utilitarian, featuring only a few rooms for sleeping and a small kitchen. No creatures are within, and the accumulation of dust makes it clear no one's disturbed the rooms for some time. Every farmhouse bears a sign that something's wrong. Roll on the Farmhouse Conditions table for each building to determine what.

**Farmhouse Conditions**

| dice: d4 | Condition |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The windows are shattered, and the shards of glass are spattered with dried blood. |
| 2 | Clothing and belongings are strewn everywhere, all covered in crimson mud. |
| 3 | Human bones, freshly gnawed by animals, litter the floor of every room. |
| 4 | A strange image is painted on the wall in red mud. It depicts either a cluster of arms with no central body or repeating red hand prints. |
^farmhouse-conditions

A character who investigates at least two of the farmhouses can make a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. On a success, they notice one farmhouse doesn't have a red _X_ painted on it. This building is the farmhouse where [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) resided, and it also serves as the pact's communal meeting house.

## Kianna's Farmhouse

A farmhouse near the center of the steading serves as a main kitchen, dining area, and meeting place for the smaller houses around it. This is the farmhouse where [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) was a resident. As the characters approach, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This large farmhouse appears abandoned like the smaller houses around it, but no _X_ marks it. Farming implements lie abandoned in the mud, and wild plants have grown up to the house's faded wooden porch. The crops in the surrounding field appear sickly.
^0c1

### Kianna's Farmhouse Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 3.1.

#### F1: Overgrown Yard

The house's yard is muddy red clay. Several rusty shovels and rakes lie scattered about.

##### Farming Implements

A character who looks around the back of the house sees a pitchfork stuck into the earth near the house's northeast corner. On further investigation, they see it's stuck through the severed hand of a young woman. The characters have no way of knowing this, but the hand was once a crawling claw and was dispatched by a [farmer](/compendium/bestiary/npc/farmer-jttrc.md).

##### Sickly Crops

Wheat and corn struggle to grow in the fields surrounding the house. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check can tell the plants around this farm are sickly because something's wrong with the soil. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices raised paths through the dirt, like mole tunnels, though no creatures are obvious. Although it's not evident, the soul shaker's evil and the excavations of the crawling claws have spoiled the land around the house.

If Proclaimer Ward is with the party, the Proclaimer investigates the crops and grows concerned. Ward stays in the field and documents the strange blight rather than joining the characters inside.

#### F2: Porch

A large wooden porch wraps around the front and one side of the farmhouse. Its planks creak ominously when stepped on, but there is no danger here. Closed curtains shroud the windows, but the doors to the interior are unlocked and ajar. Both lead to a musty central hallway.

##### Doors

The doors leading off the hallway are closed but not locked.

#### F3: Living Room

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The furniture in this living room is haphazardly arranged and looks close to falling apart. Beneath, the floor is covered in hundreds of handprints painted using crimson mud.
^0c9

The art style is similar to that of the picture [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) found in Promise. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices a break in the pattern under a chair. If the chair is moved, it reveals a muddy depiction of two children—one is reaching for the other, who is being dragged into the water by large hands. Scrapes in the muddy image form the name "Culley."

#### F4: Bedroom

The bedroom holds a bed and writing desk for a single occupant. Most of the space is neat and orderly, but the desk is strewn with art supplies and scraps of paper bearing fragmented images.

##### Paintings

Any character who riffles through the paper on the desk finds repeating images of hands, lakes, and wide eyes looking up through water. The largest work shows a pair of eyes with handprints for pupils. All these images look similar in style to the picture [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) found in Promise.

##### Chest

A small chest against the wall is unlocked and holds work clothes sized for a woman. A character who searches the chest and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a pair of overalls with a pocket containing thirteen rings—plain rings, wedding bands, and formal jewelry sized for men and women—worth 2d10 gp each.

#### F5: Dining Room

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A long plain table, a wooden sideboard, and several chairs lie shattered on the floor. The debris is streaked with crimson stains.
^0ce

This dining room has been ransacked, and red mud covers the furnishings and floor.

A character who approaches the table hears scratching coming from under it. Nothing is immediately visible beneath the table, but characters who investigate more closely find six [crawling claws](/compendium/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw.md) clinging to the underside. Once discovered, the monsters attack.

After the crawling claws are dispatched, any character who searches the room thoroughly can make a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a successful check, the character finds several floorboards that have been pushed up from below, as though the crawling claws dug their way up through the loose soil beneath the house.

#### F6: Kitchen

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This kitchen has been torn apart. Pots and pans are scattered everywhere, and rotting food streaks the floorboards.
^0d0

In the center of the room, four enchanted farmers stand facing each other, their crimson eyes unblinking. Each holds a sharp knife or farming implement. They don't react when the characters enter or if they are touched or spoken to. They react only if harmed, stolen from, or commanded by the soul shaker. Each uses the [cultist](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) stat block. Although the farmers are initially harmless, their appearance and lack of reaction are unnerving.

##### Pantry

The foodstuffs and supplies that once filled the pantry have been ransacked, and a large cupboard stands open. A trapdoor in the pantry's floor opens to reveal a 10-foot-tall ladder descending into a darkened cold-storage cellar. The stench of something rotting rises from below.

#### F7: Cellar and Tunnel

Shelves bearing root vegetables and other foodstuffs line the walls of this unfinished cellar. The south wall has partially collapsed, revealing a dark, narrow tunnel.

The smell the characters noticed above is worse here, issuing from the tunnel. Character who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher hear the faint sound of a woman singing farther down the tunnel.

Characters who proceed 40 feet into the tunnel see a faint light emanating from around a bend.

##### Tunnel Song

As the characters move through the tunnel, the song's volume increases. The characters recognize this as part of the Awakening Song they overheard in Promise. This part of the song tells the story of a young man named Culley. Rather than its usual content, where the boy dies by drowning, the song has been sloppily rewritten to feature Culley being saved by his closest friend.

#### F8: Cavern

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The tunnel opens into a lantern-lit, packed-dirt chamber, where the cause of the stench becomes apparent. A dozen bodies lie strewn across the floor, all wearing the clothes of farmers. Many of their limbs have been cleanly removed and set into a sizable pile on the far side of the cavern. In the center of the room, a young woman is singing.
^0d5

The bodies are the farmers missing from the surrounding farms—save for [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md). They've been killed and dismembered by the soul shaker.

##### Kianna

The young woman is [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) (chaotic neutral, human [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)). She looks like she's in a dream state, and she holds a knife loosely, but her eyes aren't crimson like those of the other farmers. [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) stops singing as soon as she notices the characters and says, "Please go. You shouldn't be here." If the characters speak with [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md), she drifts between fearfully urging them to leave and coaxing them to stay and meet her friend, Culley, her mood and manner shifting erratically. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) confirms she's the person the party seeks. She's saddened at any talk of [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) having sent the characters to find her.
- She speaks brightly of how Culley finally came back to her after she lost him in Cradlelace Lake. It was so good to hear his voice again!
- When [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) heard Culley's voice beyond the cellar, she dug and found this old cavern.
- Something happened to the farmers when they entered the caverns. After that they did whatever Culley said—including hurting one another and marking the houses with _X_'s to note who had visited the cellar.
- If asked about Culley, [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) sadly says her friend drowned long ago—then cheerfully says he didn't drown because she saved him. He went away for a long while, but he came back.
- If asked where Culley is now, [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) fearfully says he's sleeping after having fed. She believes her song helps keep him quiet, but she's tired.

As the characters speak with [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md), a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check notices [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md)'s eyes darting to the pile of limbs whenever she speaks brightly of Culley.

If the characters ask [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) to leave with them, she seems confused and scared, saying she can't. If she's coerced, or if a character investigates the pile of limbs, the soul shaker awakens.

##### Soul Shaker

When the characters try to leave the area or disturb the pile of limbs, the heap begins to move, revealing itself as an Undead made entirely of arms and hands. This is a [soul shaker](/compendium/bestiary/undead/soul-shaker-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure). This creature has a fraction of the memories of [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md)'s friend Culley, but the horror has perverted those thoughts, seeking to control [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md), manipulate her guilt, and use her to lure other victims into its lair. When it reveals itself, the soul shaker targets a character with its telepathy, whispering things like "Come play with us!", "Are you lonely?", and "Be with us forever!" as it attacks. It might also relate snippets from the "Fractured Soul" section of the adventure's background.

As soon as the soul shaker awakens, if the farmers the soul shaker controls are still in area F6, it summons them to aid it. The four farmers (use the [cultist](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) stat block) arrive in 2 rounds.

[Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) is confused and terrified, and she stays out of the battle.

## Conclusion

Once the soul shaker is defeated, its grip on the farm's residents fades.

### Kianna's Story

After the soul shaker is destroyed, [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) collapses into unconsciousness. A character who examines her and succeeds on a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check can tell [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) is sleep deprived and has been tormented by the strange creature. She wakes after an hour, unable to remember anything that's happened in recent days except for glimpses of strange hands and menacing words spoken in her dead friend Culley's voice. [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) shares that she blames herself for Culley's death at Cradlelace Lake, and when she heard his voice, she thought the gods might be giving her a chance to make amends. Now she just wants to return to Promise.

If asked about or shown her paintings from areas F3 or F4, she has no memory of creating them, though they're clearly in her art style. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) or [Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check recognizes [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) is no longer suffering any supernatural effects, but the character also suspects her experiences might have affected her more deeply than she realizes.

### The Farmers' Story

If any of the farmers survived, the crimson hue vanishes from their eyes after the soul shaker's destruction, and they thank the characters for saving them. Even if the farmers in the house didn't survive, one or two lost in the fields arrive at the farmhouse—perhaps with Proclaimer Ward.

The farmers remember only snippets from the last few days, and the last thing they recall clearly is preparing to return to Promise for the Awakening Festival. They also share that [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) had been behaving strangely, growing increasingly convinced that her dead friend was speaking to her. The farmers can also relate details from the adventure's background or about Cradlelace Lake if asked.

Although the farmers can't reward the characters with much in the way of wealth, they gift the group a [Heward's handy haversack](/compendium/items/hewards-handy-haversack.md) they had stashed with tools in a nearby shed. The first character to open it, however, finds that a [crawling claw](/compendium/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw.md) has gotten itself trapped within. It tries to escape as soon as it is detected.

If Proclaimer Ward is with the party, the Proclaimer stays with the farmers to help them either get back on their feet or join Uncle Polder's community.

### Back to Promise

If [Lady Dre](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lady-dre-jttrc.md) came with the characters, she and the horses have extracted her wagon from the sinkhole and are waiting for the characters.

When the characters return to Promise, [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) is overjoyed if [Kianna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kianna-jttrc.md) is safe and tearful if her goddaughter met a bitter end. Either way, she's grateful to the characters for uncovering the truth and ending the soul shaker's threat. If the characters defeated the soul shaker, she relates that the enchanted farmers in town have regained awareness. [Aunt Dellie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aunt-dellie-jttrc.md) rewards the characters with her promised payment and offers them free passage on her boat whenever they please.

## Godsbreath Gazetteer

Generations ago, a land was plundered by enemies whose names are lost to time. Five gods came together to save as many of the land's beleaguered inhabitants as they could by taking them to a new home. Those the gods saved named their new land Godsbreath, in honor of the deities who brought them across a vast sea to a new life. These inhabitants banded together to build strong communities and protect themselves from danger. From one generation to the next, they share stories of their past, of the distant lands of their ancestors, and of the unfulfilled promise of reunion with ancestors left behind in a lost land.

In Godsbreath, danger and beauty walk hand in hand. Along the southern coast, the murky, monster-stalked Nightwater Islands support tight-knit communities whose colorful houses perch on stilts. On the mainland, rising from the shore of Nightwater Cove, stands Promise, a town of brightly painted buildings and bustling trade. Northward lies a band of crimson soil known as the Ribbon—the source of this land's agricultural prosperity—which weaves through woods and floodplains. Beyond the Ribbon spreads the treacherous land of the Rattle, a territory that might hold the key to Godsbreath's future.

Each year, Promise's streets fill with people celebrating the Awakening Festival, which centers around retelling Godsbreath's past and reckoning with its present. But every year the struggle to survive becomes more dire, as the land sickens and monstrous threats become more numerous. Why the land is turning against its people is a mystery to the people of Godsbreath and a matter the gods remain silent about.

### Godsbreath Features

Those familiar with Godsbreath know the following details:

- **Hallmarks.** Godsbreath is a land known for its cooperative agricultural communities and the importance its people place on maintaining their oral history.
- **People.** The people of Godsbreath have skin tones ranging from the medium brown of copper to the near black of ebony, and most have tightly coiled dark-brown hair. Nonhumans and humans of other lands are rarely seen here; most who do live here dwell in Promise.
- **Languages.** The people of Godsbreath speak their own language, known as Godstongue, as well as Common.

### Noteworthy Sites

Godsbreath is bounded by the treacherous waters of Nightwater Cove and the dangerous expanse of the Rattle.

#### The Nightwater Isles

The Nightwater Isles rise from the waters of the murky cove from which they take their name. Though islanders mostly keep to themselves, their homes are visible from quite a distance, perched as they are on stilts to protect from floods. Each is painted in bold colors that not only honor the gods, but keep away the many monsters haunting the cove, including [giant crocodiles](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md), [shambling mounds](/compendium/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md), and [green hags](/compendium/bestiary/fey/green-hag.md).

Though each island has its own cultural and trade specialties, all the islands are connected to each other via flotillas of skims—flat-bottomed boats that ply the waters of the cove, operated by pilots known as skimmers.

#### The Ribbon and the Rattle

The zone of fertile crimson soil known as the Ribbon cuts a wide swath through the gray-brown plains that stretch from the water's edge to the lands of the Rattle. Most inhabitants of the Ribbon live on small family farms joined together in pacts—resource-sharing alliances forged by common interest.

Inexplicably, the Ribbon's soil grows less fertile each year, and no living soul in Godsbreath knows why. Residents of this land have been migrating into the fertile but dangerous lands of the Rattle. But Rattle farmers are threatened by oversized coyotes, bulettes, and other threats. Farmers whisper of strange magic that manifests without warning, causing unusual weather and reshaping the soil. Some believe these effects might be connected to ancient magics affecting the land or the will of the region's primary gods.

#### Promise

Promise is a town situated where the soil of the Ribbon meets the Nightwater Cove coast. Its paved streets and colorful two-story buildings are home to Covenant worship houses, trader storehouses, schooling circles, and more. Promise is also home to the annual Awakening Festival, which brings together folk from across Godsbreath. Participants trade wares, relive their shared history through the call-and-response _Awakening Song_, and settle regional disputes at the communal and annual summit known as the Meet, where canny traders and powerful pacts seek to gain influence.

### Life in Godsbreath

Those who dwell in or travel through Godsbreath understand the truths underlying life in this land.

#### Community and Consensus

Each community in Godsbreath is self-governing, with intercommunity and regional disputes settled at the annual Meet. Held in Promise during the Awakening Festival, this public forum between community leaders seeks majority consensus on each issue raised. The Meet continues until all items are resolved or half the participants leave.

Crime in Godsbreath is rare, and justice in this land focuses on making the wronged party whole. Decisions on how to make amends come through groups known as sevens—assemblies of the seven people who are closest at hand when an accusation of criminal behavior is made, but who have no direct stake in the outcome. For the most severe wrongs, offenders are banished to uninhabited islands, though they retain the right to travel to the Meet each year to seek reconciliation with the larger community.

#### The Gods' Tale

The influence of the deities who founded Godsbreath is captured in the Covenant tales—verses of the _Awakening Song_ that tell stories of the gods' past exploits and share signs of their current influence. The bright colors found on homes throughout the region each honor a Covenant god, and many people craft and carry charms to invoke a favorite god's protection.

#### Proclaimers and the Covenant

The Proclaimers of the Covenant are the acolytes of Godsbreath's deities, tasked with promoting worship of the Covenant and maintaining the _Awakening Song_ as a living history of this land. They take turns traveling throughout Godsbreath, listening to deeds of local renown that could be added to the _Awakening Song_, sharing stories from other regions, and challenging people to live up to the Covenant gods' example.

The Covenant is a pantheon of deities with a particular interest in Godsbreath. They have varied alignments and interests. This local pantheon is for you to define and might include gods appropriate to your campaign's setting or deities unique to Godsbreath.

#### Shared Stories

Stories are the glue that binds Godsbreath together, tying its people to their ancestors who helped shape this land and passing down traditions and beliefs through all the generations since. Most people here begin conversations with "give a listen" or "tell me true" before exchanging stories—the more captivating, the better. Although this sometimes encourages exaggeration, Godsbreath's people believe you can hear truth in the telling of any tale, and all enjoy the art of a well-crafted boast.

Stories of all kinds are shared around the evening fire in the heart of each community, while folk dine on roast rabbit and hog, spoon bread, hominy, rice and gravy, corn pone, or crawfish stew. Especially captivating tales might be memorialized on a grass-woven story basket from the Nightwater Isles or added to a Ribbon family's fireside quilt, creating invaluable heirlooms protected at all costs. Truly extraordinary stories might even be captured in song by one of the Proclaimers of the Covenant. Having a story chosen is a great honor and can make alliances and invitations to adventure easier to come by.

#### Names

Most folk in Godsbreath go by a single name—often a nickname picked up in their youth instead of their given name—preceded by an honorific reflecting their age, profession, or standing in the community. Those too young to have an honorific may be addressed without one, though it's often wise for strangers to use a courtesy honorific—Miss, Mister, Cousin—as a sign of respect. The following are examples of common given names in Godsbreath:

- **Feminine.** Aba, Bilah, Diya, Emilene, Essie, Sukie
- **Masculine.** Cato, Ellis, Kumber, Mobe, Saffran, Sogo
- **Gender-Neutral.** Deland, Holston, June, Madel, Winter
- **Surnames.** Godskith, Grayshore, Hilltop, Longkin, Riveridge

### Legends of Godsbreath

Most people in Godsbreath worship one or more of the Covenant gods, who worked together to bring the first folk to this new land. Over long generations since, these deities have stood united as the guardians of Godsbreath. But of late, they have begun to work independently to recruit and reward their own followers. Through recent prophecies known only to themselves, the members of the Covenant have learned the blood of a deity is needed to revitalize the soil of the Ribbon and stave off potential famine across Godsbreath. In response, the gods are becoming more active, shoring up their power to avoid becoming this necessary sacrifice.

### Adventures in Godsbreath

Consider the plots on the Godsbreath Adventures table when planning adventures in Godsbreath.

**Godsbreath Adventures**

| dice: d4 | Adventure |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A pack of giant coyotes ([dire wolves](/compendium/bestiary/beast/dire-wolf.md)) ventures far from the Rattle, threatening harvests in the Ribbon. The pack's leader is a particularly vicious, red-furred specimen. The characters are hired to end the creatures' threat. |
| 2 | The water subsides from Cradlelace Lake, revealing a hidden house haunted by a long-limbed phantom who keeps her family of spirits trapped. A mysterious message reaches the characters, entreating them to free the captive souls. |

### Characters from Godsbreath

If players want to create characters from Godsbreath, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**Who in your family was memorialized in the Awakening Song**? Why do you love or hate that your family is connected to this regional memory? Is the song true? Do you think you will be memorialized in the song?

**Have you spent a harvest season in the monster-filled Rattle?** How did you respond to the threats of that region? Have you come close to losing anyone you cared about there?

**Do you feel close to the gods of the Covenant?** Why do you feel like you have this connection? How do you honor or otherwise interact with these deities?

## Soul Shaker

A grasping mass of Humanoid limbs, a soul shaker is an obsessive claimer of corpses and collector of body parts. These nightmarish creatures arise from ghoulish collections of severed limbs exposed to necromantic energies or when numerous [crawling claws](/compendium/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw.md) form a cooperative relationship.

Most of a soul shaker's victims have their vitality drained and their flesh pulverized by its many arms. However, should a soul shaker encounter someone with an impressionable mind, the creature attempts to charm the individual, using them as a lure to tempt others into its hunting grounds.

If defeated, a soul shaker disperses into several skittering, animate limbs. The terror can only truly be vanquished by destroying these disembodied appendages. If more than one of these pieces escape, the soul shaker reforms over the course of days and begins hunting once more.
