# Beyond the Radiant Citadel
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel* 

When the Radiant Citadel was rediscovered, the Dawn Incarnates lay dormant in the Preserve of the Ancestors. Thirteen were reawakened, but no one could revive the Pearl Carp, Sard Elephant, or the Dawn Avatars associated with the Radiant Citadel's other missing founding civilizations. Recently, agents of the Court of Whispers rediscovered paths to the lands known as the Tayyib Empire and Umizu. When peoples from those realms arrived at the Radiant Citadel, the Pearl Carp and the Sard Elephant awakened, and representatives have since joined the Speakers for the Ancestors. This gives the people of the Radiant Citadel hope that other lost civilizations might also be found.

This section provides overviews of two additional lands connected to the Radiant Citadel. Detail and incorporate them into adventures as you please.

## Tayyib Empire

The Tayyib Empire recently emerged from a brutal civil war, but its peace is fragile. Monsters roam the hinterland, and people vie for power to stave off desperation during the recovery.

The war began in response to the death of Emperor Tasneem, whose older heirs turned to sinister magic in their attempts to rule. These heirs burned the former capital and unleashed legions of unliving horrors. Chaos ruled the land until the emperor's youngest daughter, Firuzeh, defeated her siblings and ascended the throne.

She inherited a nation stretched to the limit. But across war-torn territories, people rebuild marble domes and sparkling minarets to raise a new empire that serves its citizens as past rulers failed to do. It is a precarious time, but also one of great opportunity.

### Noteworthy Sites

The Tayyib Empire spans a region called Suristhanam. Its geography includes a great central flood plain, fertile hills, and tropical swamps.

#### Qaragarh

A metropolis filled with breathtaking plazas and public reflecting pools, the empire's new capital teems with people who see the city as the promise of the empress made manifest. Adventurers come to Qaragarh seeking employment from the empress, who needs support to stabilize her empire. Travelers arrive and depart through the Hall of Doors, which houses teleportation circles linked to locations across the empire.

#### Bijabad

Bijabad and the surrounding region were the breadbasket of the empire until war took its toll. Now bulettes and griffons terrorize the countryside, and work crews periodically unearth Undead left behind by the conflict. The city's struggling reconstruction efforts are chronically understaffed, so a grassroots network of veterans and influential townsfolk called the Old Sickles has taken efforts into its own hands.

#### Churapoor

A natural harbor shelters the port of Churapoor from seasonal monsoons. Despite the devastation of war, the city boasts a healthy economy, but it always needs adventurers to guard its shipments of alchemical concoctions, spices, and rich textiles.

### Life in the Tayyib Empire

The Tayyib Empire is a cosmopolitan mix of the native peoples of Suristhanam, immigrants, and various invading groups. Nearly half the population are brown-skinned humans, with significant elf, hobgoblin, lizardfolk, and yuan-ti populations making up most of the remainder.

#### Faith and Religion

The dominant faith is Iwahhid, a philosophy that rejects idols and promotes worshiping the source of divinity rather than its fallible manifestations. Its adherents are called Muwahhid. Some erudite worshipers join the Imperial Ulema, an order of Muwahhid scholars sponsored by the throne. The Ulema provides spellcasting services to the populace and maintains the empire's infrastructure of magical street lights and teleportation circles.

#### Fashion and Food

Clothing in the empire tends to be long and billowing. Men's fashion includes jamas and sherwanis, or loose kurtas secured with a shawl. Women's fashion includes saris and salwars. Clothing is colorful and patterned, with some wealthy citizens sporting garments bearing magic that perfumes the wearer on command or changes color.

Tayyib dishes are creamy and mildly spiced, cooked with yogurt, and served with rice or flatbreads. Dried lentils are soaked and made into various dal dishes, while slow-cooked rice, spices, and vegetables are transformed into fragrant biryani. Faithful Muwahhid avoid alcohol and predator meat, and many are vegetarians.

#### Monarchy and Order

Authority in the Tayyib Empire stems from Empress Firuzeh. Nobles who hold prewar titles are respected, while state-appointed judges enforce the law across the empire. This system is prone to corruption, but the empress's agents vigilantly ferret out dishonest officials, delegating that task to trustworthy adventurers when necessary.

### Adventures in the Tayyib Empire

Consider the plots on the Tayyib Empire Adventures table when planning forays through the empire.

## Umizu

Residents of the city-state of Umizu enjoy their fair share of luck, but good fortune comes at a cost: a season of bad luck that arrives with the yearly monsoon. During this time, locals pray at shrines for protection against misfortune, and attendants keep a watchful eye for grim portents in the rains.

Set amid glittering turquoise waters, Umizu has long enjoyed prosperity that masks ever-simmering tension. Daimyo Hogishi Takemi does his best to rein in crime, but the city's lackluster bureaucracy is run by complacent samurai administrators and riddled with corruption. Crime syndicates control the city's underground trade and administer their own brand of justice. Meanwhile, the Southwest Whaling Concern, an influential merchant organization, builds a private navy and clashes with the Rurapo, an indigenous clan of tritons who monitor fishing and whaling activity. In the wake of the whalers' blatant overfishing, the Rurapo are divided on whether to renegotiate their treaty with Umizu or declare war.

### Noteworthy Sites

Each city district features its own architectural aesthetics. The districts cling to volcanic islands connected by sturdy stone bridges, ferries, and steam-powered funiculars.

#### Bright Moon Pier

This collection of massive piers hosts a marketplace and is the haven of Umizu's premier criminal syndicate, the Safe Oceans Society. Most merchants here deal with the Safe Oceans Society eventually, whether to smuggle goods, avoid taxes, or quietly resolve conflicts. Society lieutenants run gambling dens disguised as tea rooms along the pier, while samurai and scoundrels test their mettle beneath the waves in underwater fighting rings. To avoid scrutiny, the Safe Oceans Society employs adventurers as independent operatives—while virtuous samurai-class bureaucrats hire them to investigate the syndicate's crimes.

Rurapo sometimes visit the pier to trade or sample crunchy Umizu pickles. Some have forged uneasy alliances with the Safe Oceans Society, providing illegal relics from sunken temples and shipwrecks.

#### Governor's Palace

A massive villa serves as the central administrative offices of Umizu and the residence of its mayor, Daimyo Hogishi Takemi. The palace is famous for Hogishi's elegant parties and for an annual poetry competition that draws nobles to Umizu—along with their bitter rivalries and personal guards.

#### Shrine of Storms

The Shrine of Storms is an ancient place of spiritual power. Cut deep into its island alongside residencies for the shrine's warrior-priests and libraries holding relics from around the world, the shrine is central to Umizu's many celebrations. Each winter, citizens gather for the Thunder Festival and honor the Turtle Sage—the guardian spirit of the islands—with three days of drumming, dancing, and prayer.

### Life in Umizu

Umizu is a welcoming city, and many citizens hail from far-flung lands. Humans are the most numerous, with skin tones ranging from pale to medium brown, and with hair and eyes ranging from dark brown to black.

#### Social Mores

Umizu is a matrilineal culture with a preference for succession by women. Most families live in multigenerational homes, and the wealthiest favor polyamorous marriages, typically with a clan matriarch and several spouses of any gender. Powerful clans compete for prestige through formal dueling matches every few months.

Umizu has few taboos around sexuality and gender. Titles such as "daimyo" are gender-neutral, as are most names. Clothing varies by class status rather than gender—instead, people express their gender through perfumes. Bright citrus scents are feminine coded, musky wood tones are gender-neutral, and floral scents are masculine. Umizu has rigid sumptuary laws that reinforce the social hierarchy, restricting colors, fabrics, and styles of dress based on class.

#### Ancestor Spirits

Respect for the spirits infuses daily life. Native residents keep shrines to their ancestors in their homes and leave out offerings at dawn and dusk. They consult ancestral spirits before making life-changing decisions, but the perspectives of the dead can be just as flawed as those of the living. Disagreements in large family clans sometimes result in battles involving hundreds of ancestor spirits, with tumultuous consequences for their living descendants.

#### Seasonal Misfortune

The Demon Festival kicks off the summer monsoon season, marking a city-wide period of misfortune. Citizens visit the Shrine of Storms to purchase talismans of protection and beseech the Turtle Sage for good luck. At sundown, the shrine's attendants ride barges through Umizu's waterways, shouting taunts to draw out fell spirits while people dressed as demons dance on bridges and walkways.

### Adventures in Umizu

Consider the plots on the Umizu Adventures table when planning explorations in Umizu.
