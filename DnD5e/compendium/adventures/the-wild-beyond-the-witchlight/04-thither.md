# Thither
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, p. 99* 

Thither is a sprawling fey woodland with a decaying core. With each passing day, Granny Nightshade's presence eats away at the forest's trees and taints its denizens. The rot worsens the closer one gets to Loomlurch, Granny Nightshade's lair.

## Running This Chapter

In this chapter, the characters explore the forests of Thither. They could be searching for their lost things or questing for a means to overthrow the Hourglass Coven. Deep in the forest, they can confront Granny Nightshade in her lair.

Before your first game session in Thither, follow these steps to help make the players' experience as entertaining as possible:

- Thither is ruled by [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md), also known as Granny Nightshade. Read her description and skim her stat block in appendix B.
- Read this chapter in its entirety, and reacquaint yourself with the "Prismeer Overview" in chapter 2.
- Look over the map of Thither. Locations marked on the map are described later in this chapter.

### Lost Things in Thither

If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook, check the Story Tracker to see if [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) has anything the characters want to reclaim. When the characters enter Thither, anyone who had something stolen by Skabatha gets the nagging sensation that it is somewhere in this realm, though the character doesn't know where. The feeling fades when the character either regains what was lost or leaves Thither without recovering it. To find what they've lost, the characters must travel to Loomlurch. Objects that Granny Nightshade created using things she stole from the characters can be found in her dollhouse (see area L16).

### Navigating Thither

Using the map of Thither as a reference, describe what the characters see as they forge their own path through the splinter-realm. Named locations on the map are described later in the chapter.

Shortly after arriving in Thither, the characters come upon a cave that is the home of a miser who spins gold into magic items. The miser, Nib, can provide directions to other locations in Thither. As the characters make their way through Thither's ancient forest, they might find a fairy ring or a wanted poster (see "Features of Thither") or have a random encounter (see "Arrival in Thither").

At Little Oak, the characters meet the Getaway Gang, a gaggle of lost children led by a rapscallion named Will of the Feywild. The Getaway Gang can teach the characters how to reach Wayward Pool, an idyllic lake protected by a unicorn named Lamorna, who knows important information about Zybilna's fall and explains the importance of finding the horn that belongs to her lost mate, Elidon.

Characters who have business or grievances with the perfidious Granny Nightshade can venture to Loomlurch (an enormous, hollowed-out tree that houses the hag's workshop) and seek her out. A bargain they struck with [Bavlorna Blightstraw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md) in chapter 2 might also require the characters to pay Loomlurch a visit.

#### Guide from Thither to Yon

Squirt, an animated oilcan, can guide characters from Thither to Yon and back to Thither. Squirt resides at Little Oak (see "Locations in Thither"). If you choose not to run the Little Oak encounter, you can place Squirt in another location that the characters are likely to visit.

## Features of Thither

The following physical features can be found across the realm of Thither.

### Fairy Rings

When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, the forests of Thither were home to a host of fairy rings that functioned as fey crossings to different worlds in the Material Plane. Granny Nightshade has corrupted as many of the rings as she could find, making them dangerous to visitors.

Fairy rings are depicted on the map of Thither. Each ring is a 20-foot-diameter circle of colorful, 6-inch-tall toadstools located in a small clearing protected by the thick forest canopy. It radiates an aura of conjuration magic when scrutinized with a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell.

To determine whether a fairy ring is uncorrupted or corrupted, roll a d8. On a roll of 3 or higher, the fairy ring is uncorrupted; otherwise, it is corrupted.

#### Uncorrupted Fairy Rings

Roll a d8 when the characters come across an uncorrupted fairy ring. On a roll of 1 or 2, there are no creatures in the ring's vicinity. On a roll of 3 or higher, the ring has a [swarm of campestris](/compendium/bestiary/plant/swarm-of-campestris-wbtw.md) (see appendix C) singing and dancing inside it. Using body language, these cute, mushroom-like creatures urge the characters to join in their reverie. Any character who does so can make a DC 12 Charisma ([Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check, gaining the benefit of a [true seeing](/compendium/spells/true-seeing.md) spell that lasts for 24 hours on a successful check (no effect on a failure). The campestris aren't clever enough to answer complex questions about Thither or offer reliable directions, and they speak by mimicking words they can hear.

The campestris' love for singing is obvious. Any character who tries to teach them a new song can make a DC 13 Charisma ([Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check. On a successful check, the campestris adopt the song into their routine and bestow a _charm of heroism_ (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide") on the character responsible. The campestris in any given fairy ring can bestow this charm once only. Check the Story Tracker: any character who received singing lessons from Palasha the mermaid in chapter 1 has advantage on this check.

##### Activating the Fey Crossing

To use an uncorrupted fairy ring as a fey crossing, a creature must hold a wand or a stick of wood above its head and run in a circle counterclockwise while saying, "Three turns widdershins, and off we go!" If the creature performing this act is a Fey or has fey ancestry, its effort transports all creatures inside the fairy ring to a remote location on a Material Plane world of your choice. They might arrive inside a similar fairy ring that is hidden in an elven tomb or inside the tumbled-down ruin of an ancient tower, for example. If the creature holding the wand and running widdershins is neither a Fey nor of fey ancestry, the fey crossing activates only if exactly eight creatures are inside the ring.

The fey crossing works both ways, allowing travel to and from Thither. Returning to Thither, however, might require fulfilling a different set of conditions. For example, the fey crossing on the Material Plane side might operate only at twilight or on nights of the full moon, and it might require an orb instead of a wand or a stick.

Characters can plumb the depths of their memories and, with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check, recall enough folklore about fairy rings to know what must be done to activate these particular fey crossings.

#### Corrupted Fairy Rings

A corrupted fairy ring has no campestris singing and dancing inside it. Instead, Granny Nightshade has cast [awaken](/compendium/spells/awaken.md) spells on the 3d8 + 60 toadstools that form the ring, giving each of them the ability to speak Common. These awakened toadstools are mocking and rude toward visitors not accompanied by Granny Nightshade, and they move away from one another, breaking the ring, whenever someone other than the hag tries to use it as a fey crossing, rendering it unusable. Each awakened toadstool has AC 7, 1 hit point, no effective attacks, an Intelligence score of 10, and other ability scores of 1. Killing more than half of a ring's toadstools renders the ring unusable.

### Wanted Posters

Granny Nightshade has attached wanted posters to trees throughout Thither, offering rewards for the capture of her nemesis, Will of the Feywild (see "Locations in Thither"). Each poster consists of a portrait of the boy drawn in ink, above which are the following words in the Elvish script:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> _Wanted: Will of the Feywild_!
^1f2

Each poster promises a different reward for Will's capture. Whenever you want the characters to find such a poster, or when the text calls for it, roll on the Wanted Posters table to determine which poster the characters have just discovered and what it offers as a reward. If you get the same result as a previous discovery, either roll again or choose an unused entry from the table.

**Wanted Posters**

| dice: d8 | Offer | Reward |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | "This sorry wretch has stolen from me! Deliver him to me alive and unharmed, and I'll give you back ten years of your youth." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a yellow rose. As long as this rose remains unwilted and in the character's possession, the character relives the first ten years of their life as a vivid dream whenever they finish a long rest. After 8 days, the rose wilts and loses this magical property. |
| 2 | "This little troublemaker belongs to me. Bring him home alive and unharmed, and you'll win the heart of one you love." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a box containing the eviscerated heart of someone they love. This special someone can't be another party member, but it could be a family member or an old flame. The identity of this individual is known to Granny Nightshade, but she prefers not to divulge it. |
| 3 | "Bring me this imp alive and unharmed, and I'll bury you up to your neck in silver." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a silver ring, which disappears when the character touches it. The instant the ring disappears, the character becomes encased in a silver ingot (no saving throw allowed), with only the character's head visible. The character is unable to move from the neck down while encased in the ingot. With 12 hours of work, a creature using mason's tools can free the character from the ingot. The character can also use a [misty step](/compendium/spells/misty-step.md) spell (or some other magic that doesn't require material or somatic components) to teleport out of the ingot. The silver disappears when the character is no longer trapped in it. |
| 4 | "Bring this wisp of a thief to me alive and unharmed, and I'll ensure that no sword can ever break your skin." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a stone ring, which disappears when the character touches it. The instant the ring disappears, the character is [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) (no saving throw allowed). |
| 5 | "Deliver this rascal alive and unharmed. As payment, I offer you the power to bring the dead back to life." | Granny Nightshade gives the character an 11-inch-long bone wand. When the character touches the wand to the corpse of a dead Humanoid, the wand turns to dust as the corpse transforms into a [zombie](/compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) with vague recollections of its past life. |
| 6 | "This rapscallion vexes me. Deliver him to me alive and unharmed, and I'll curse one creature whom you name." | The instant the character identifies the target of the curse, a [bestow curse](/compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md) spell affects that creature (no saving throw allowed). Granny Nightshade does not have to see or touch the target for the spell to take effect, and the target can be any creature, including Granny Nightshade herself. |
| 7 | "How dare this ragamuffin defy me? Bring him to me alive and unharmed, and I'll grant you a loyal servant." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a friendly [frog](/compendium/bestiary/beast/frog.md) companion that has an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak and understand Common. |
| 8 | "Special offer! Bring this impetuous brat to me, and you can claim one item of your choice from my workshop." | Granny Nightshade is true to her word: the character can claim any one object from her workshop they can see or identify by name. The hag either fetches the item herself or commands a servant to do so. |
^wanted-posters

After delivering Will to Granny Nightshade, a character can choose to redeem one of these posters, whereupon the hag must give that character the poster's promised reward. A character need not collect the reward immediately; a poster can be redeemed at any time as long as Will remains in the hag's custody. Trading a poster for its promised reward constitutes a fey pact, the terms of which are enforced by the magic of the Feywild. A character can collect multiple posters, but only one poster per character can be redeemed. Granny Nightshade is not obligated to give a reward to any character who doesn't hand her a poster. She must accept a poster that is handed to her; when she does, the poster vanishes in a puff of smoke, and the hag must offer the promised reward to the character immediately. In most cases, the reward is a creature or object that is magically delivered into Granny Nightshade's custody when the poster vanishes. (Exceptions are noted in the Rewards column of the Wanted Posters table.) Whether the character chooses to accept the reward at that point is up to them, but offering the reward is enough to free Granny Nightshade from her obligation.

Granny Nightshade has no sympathy for characters who don't like the rewards she bestows, and she offers no way of undoing the rewards' magical effects.

## Arrival in Thither

When the adventurers first arrive in Thither, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The mists part to reveal a primeval forest. A fragrant breeze wafts between the enormous trees, sending motes of pollen dancing into the air. Patches of sunlight kiss the forest floor, and the sweet melody of birdsong echoes all around.
^1f4

Their guide leads the characters to Nib's Cave, the location of which is shown on the map of Thither. Along the way, the characters might have a random encounter, at your discretion (see "Random Encounters in Thither" below).

### Random Encounters in Thither

Roll for a random encounter whenever you feel it is appropriate; for example, you might decide to stage a random encounter while the characters are traveling toward a location marked on the map of Thither or when they first arrive at a particular landmark.

To determine what the characters encounter, roll a d8 and consult the Random Encounters in Thither table. Several of the random encounters described below are with specific named creatures and therefore aren't likely to happen more than once unless the characters revisit familiar ground. If you roll on the table, get the same result as on a previous roll, and don't like the repetition, choose a different encounter that you think would be fun.

**Random Encounters in Thither**

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Blink dogs |
| 2 | Buttered campestri |
| 3 | Centaur |
| 4 | Doomed dryad |
| 5 | Grandfather tree |
| 6 | Jabberwock's trail |
| 7 | Owlbear and chariot |
| 8 | Pixies |
^random-encounters-in-thither

#### Blink Dogs

The characters spot 1d6 + 2 [blink dogs](/compendium/bestiary/fey/blink-dog.md) 60 feet ahead of them. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 13 or higher can see that the dogs are surrounding a crudely dug hole in the ground. The characters must get within 5 feet of the hole to see that it's a shallow grave containing the body of a dead blink dog laid out on a reed litter. The dogs howl sadly while solemnly placing gifts for their deceased companion to enjoy in its afterlife. If the ceremony is not disturbed, the howling and gift-giving ends 1 minute later, after which the blink dogs fill in the hole with loose dirt, burying the dead dog. The mournful dogs then lope away.

The blink dogs don't take kindly to interruptions, but characters who approach respectfully can talk to them after the ceremony, assuming they are able to speak the dogs' language. The blink dogs reveal that their companion was slain while scouting out Loomlurch and the surrounding area. They urge any characters heading for the hag's lair to be cautious. The blink dogs can reveal the following information about the hag and her lair:

- Next to Loomlurch is a goblin market that sells all sorts of candy treats.
- The scarecrows planted in Granny Nightshade's garden scream loudly if they spot intruders.
- Granny Nightshade uses clockwork sparrows to communicate with her wicked sisters.

#### Buttered Campestri

The characters come across a campfire in the forest. A cauldron of water bubbles over the flames, and a frying pan that holds melted butter rests on a nearby rock. A lone [campestri](/compendium/bestiary/plant/campestri-wbtw.md) (see appendix C) sings merrily as it dips its cap into the butter. If questioned, the campestri says its friend, Kro'ah, asked it to rub melted butter into its flesh and has promised it a hot bath before dinner. Kro'ah is gathering firewood but should be back soon! Persuading the campestri to leave the campsite requires a successful DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. After 1d4 + 2 minutes, Kro'ah the [goblin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) (chaotic neutral) returns for his dinner. In addition to an armful of firewood, the goblin has an explorer's pack.

Although Kro'ah has no regard for the life of campestris and finds them quite delicious, he won't pick a fight with a group of well-armed adventurers. If the characters leave him alone, he gives them some useful information:

- There's a market at Loomlurch that sells all kinds of candy. (Kro'ah offers each character a stick of candy as proof.) The market is supervised by a goblin with a toffee apple head.
- Granny Nightshade puts children to work in her toy shop. The hag has a large key protruding from her back, almost like she's a big wind-up toy herself.

#### Centaur

An aged [centaur](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md) named Winterbow approaches the characters and warns them that this realm is fading; they should return to their own world before Prismeer disappears entirely. Winterbow reveals that the other members of his clan galloped away to safety before the mists enveloped Prismeer, but he was too old to keep up with them. The centaur doesn't know the cause of the realm's impending destruction. If the characters seem kind, he tells them to seek out the unicorn at Wayward Pool for answers.

Winterbow's walking speed is 25 feet, and his vision is limited to a range of 60 feet. He knows the woods of Thither well enough to point characters in the direction of Loomlurch if that's where they aim to go.

#### Doomed Dryad

A hostile [dryad](/compendium/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) and seven [awakened shrubs](/compendium/bestiary/plant/awakened-shrub.md) emerge from the undergrowth and surround the characters. Any character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 13 or higher spots the dryad and the shrubs before they arrive, and all other characters are surprised.

The dryad, Meadowleaf, was bound to an enchanted tree that Granny Nightshade felled and used to make wooden toys. Believing the characters to be mercenaries hired by Granny Nightshade to capture Will of the Feywild and the Getaway Gang, the dryad points an accusing finger toward them and orders the awakened shrubs, "Show these villains the true meaning of revenge!"

A character can use an action to make a DC 13 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check in the hope of ending hostilities. On a successful check, the character convinces Meadowleaf (and, by extension, the shrubs) not to attack on their next turn, giving the characters a brief time in which to counter any false notions the dryad might have about the party's intentions and allegiances. If the characters make a sound argument in their defense, or if four or more shrubs are killed in the ensuing battle, Meadowleaf calls off the attack.

The dryad is too bitter and angry to apologize for any errors in judgment on her part. Reminding her of the rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2) is enough to convince her that she should be nicer to travelers passing through the forest, which is the closest thing she has to a home now that her beloved tree is gone.

Deprived of her tree, Meadowleaf is doomed to sink ever deeper into despair. If her encounter with the characters ends peacefully, she urges them to restore Zybilna to power so that other dryads won't suffer a similar fate. She also gives the characters three sycamore seeds. A creature that eats one of these seeds gains the benefit of a [pass without trace](/compendium/spells/pass-without-trace.md) spell, which lasts for 1 hour.

#### Grandfather Tree

The characters happen upon the following scene:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A gigantic, gnarled oak comes into view. Unlike other oaks in the forest, this tree looks unhealthy and has golden brown leaves. A thick carpet of dead leaves surrounds it, and three rusty sickles lie among the leaves. Standing next to each of these weapons is a bleating goat.
> 
> Eight tiny houses made of woven twigs are nestled among the boughs of the tree. Squirrels dart nervously around these wee domiciles.
^1fb

The tree is dying due to the presence of the evil hag: it has simply given up the will to live. The tree is home to twenty-four [pixies](/compendium/bestiary/fey/pixie.md), all of which are [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) when the characters first arrive. The pixies share their twig houses with three families of squirrels. Less than an hour ago, three [redcaps](/compendium/bestiary/fey/redcap-mpmm.md) emerged from the woods and started throwing rocks at the pixie houses, trying to destroy them out of spite. The pixies retaliated by polymorphing the redcaps into [goats](/compendium/bestiary/beast/goat.md). When the [polymorph](/compendium/spells/polymorph.md) spells wear off in about 10 minutes, the pixies plan to polymorph the redcaps again unless they leave immediately. The pixies are unaccustomed to dealing with redcaps and don't know what else to do.

If the characters approach the tree and do not appear threatening, three pixies named Amaryllis, Calluna, and Zinnia become visible and warn the characters not to slay the goats, lest they transform back into redcaps. The pixies are nonviolent and would appreciate the characters' help. One thing the characters can do is gather up the redcaps' sickles (which they dropped when they started throwing rocks at the tree). The seizure of these weapons causes the goats to attack.

If they are deprived of their weapons and returned to their normal forms, the redcaps stomp their iron boots and demand that their sickles be returned to them. If the characters refuse to do so, the redcaps scream in fury and swear profusely before stomping away. Without their sickles, these redcaps are all bluster. If their weapons are returned to them, the redcaps attack the characters, hoping to soak their hats in the characters' blood. If the characters seem unable to deal with the redcaps on their own, the pixies use their magic to assist.

Once the redcaps are no longer a threat, the pixies share the following information with the characters:

- The redcaps started appearing when Granny Nightshade took over the forest. Like their creator, the redcaps appear to have no redeeming qualities.
- The hag grows the redcaps in a garden near her lair, which is inside a fallen tree that spans a ravine. (The pixies can't agree on the distance or direction to the hag's lair.)
- The grandfather oak upon which the pixies built their village is sickened by the hag's presence. Ridding Thither of Granny Nightshade might be the only way to return the tree to good health.

##### Development

If the characters pass this way again after defeating the hag, they find the old tree's branches covered in fresh green buds—a sign that the grandfather oak is healing.

#### Jabberwock's Trail

The characters come across a trail of monstrous claw prints on the forest floor. Whatever creature left the trail was clearly enormous, as each print spans three feet from heel to toe. A character who examines the prints and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check identifies them as belonging to some kind of dragon-like creature. After a few miles, the trail disappears abruptly. A character who examines the prints at the end of the trail can tell that they're unusually deep and can, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check, conclude that the creature launched itself into the air at this point, suggesting that it can fly.

#### Owlbear and Chariot

The characters encounter a domesticated [owlbear](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md) yoked to a dilapidated elven chariot. It ran off into the woods after its rider, an elf, was snatched from the chariot by the jabberwock that frequents Zybilna's palace (see chapter 5). The owlbear's harness boss is engraved with a branch of the tree for which she is named: Juniper. The chariot is big enough to hold two Medium characters and their gear.

Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check can calm Juniper and use her as a steed. The owlbear must be fed at least 8 pounds of meat every day to keep her docile. If she goes just one day without a proper meal, Juniper turns on her new owners and tries to eat them.

#### Pixies

Three [pixies](/compendium/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) sit around a tiny table, sipping tea and nibbling cakes. A 6-inch-long wedge made of wood lies on the ground nearby. The pixies found this piece of wood (a doorstop) on one of their recent forays into the Material Plane and are arguing about what it could be. Spiderlily thinks it's a slice of cake made for a treant, Cowslip thinks it's an exercise bench for mice, and Maypole is convinced it's a troll's toothpick.

The pixies entreat the characters to settle their dispute. They are profoundly disappointed to learn of the doorstop's mundane purpose and giggle with delight if they are treated to a convincing lie. Either way, they give a reed whistle to the character who impressed them the most. Once before the end of this adventure, that character can blow the whistle to summon the three pixies. This effect functions as a [conjure woodland beings](/compendium/spells/conjure-woodland-beings.md) spell that summons only the three pixies and doesn't require concentration. The pixies fly away when the spell ends after 1 hour.

## Locations in Thither

The following encounters are tied to locations marked on the map of Thither. As the characters explore Thither, you can move these locations as needed, putting them in the characters' path. Ideally, you should run all three encounters in the following order before the characters arrive at Loomlurch or travel to Yon:

### Nib's Cave

The characters meet an old man who offers them gifts made from spun gold and who knows where the characters might find Will of the Feywild, a troublesome boy with a penchant for causing Granny Nightshade grief.

### Little Oak

Will of the Feywild leads the Getaway Gang from a treehouse nestled in the boughs of a friendly treant. Will knows the secret to the Hourglass Coven's undoing and suggests that the characters talk to Lamorna, a unicorn who lives by the Wayward Pool.

### Wayward Pool

Lamorna the unicorn has lost her mate, and she believes that the magic that traps Zybilna in the palace was accomplished using her mate's horn. Finding that unicorn horn might be the only way to free Zybilna and rid Prismeer of the Hourglass Coven.

### Nib's Cave

A miser toils inside a cave, spinning his gold into gifts for those who visit him. When the characters happen upon Nib's cave, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Cozy torchlight radiates from a cave in the wooded hillside. Twenty feet from the cave is a tree with a weathered sheet of parchment nailed to its trunk.
^207

The parchment nailed to the tree is one of Granny Nightshade's wanted posters (see "Wanted Posters" earlier in the chapter). Roll on the Wanted Posters table to determine which poster it is, and record this information on the Story Tracker.

Characters who announce their arrival hear an old man invite them inside the cave. If they enter, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Inside the cave, a wizened old man wearing a blindfold sits at a spinning wheel, surrounded by piles of gold. As he spins, he reaches down and grasps handfuls of coins, which transform at his touch into gleaming gold fibers.
^208

Nib is an unarmed human [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) (neutral) from a city called Waterdeep on a world called Toril. He is [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded), but only while wearing his blindfold. His cave contains a total of 27,213 gp, heaped in piles on the floor—what's left of Nib's acquired wealth. The gold radiates an aura of conjuration magic if inspected with a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Nib.

If the characters inquire about Nib's predicament, he recounts his sorry tale:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "I've led a cruel and heartless existence. I earned these riches by exploiting my tenants' misery, buying up condemned property and renting it out for an exorbitant fee. Granny Nightshade is helping me to make amends. I told her I wanted to put my bad deeds behind me and my ill-gotten gains to good use. She cursed me to dwell forever in this cave, spinning my gold into useful items for anyone who comes my way."
^209

In accordance with the rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2), Nib offers to craft a gift for each character. Taking up a pair of knitting needles, he swiftly knits his gold yarn into an object that retains a golden luster or some amount of golden color in its design. Roll a d8 and refer to the Gold-spun Gifts table to determine each item. (All the items listed in the table are uncommon magic items.) If a character asks Nib to make something specific, Nib honors that request, provided the desired item is a nonmagical item worth no more than 1,000 gp, or a magic item of common or uncommon rarity. Nib can make only one gift for each character, and his spinning wheel can't work its magic under any other hand. Nib's supply of gold coins decreases by an amount equal to the value of the item he creates (minimum 1 gp). A common magic item reduces his supply by 100 gp, while an uncommon magic item reduces it by 500 gp.

A character might feel obliged to honor the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2) and offer Nib something in return for his gifts. Nib kindly accepts whatever the character offers but isn't looking for help to end his curse, because as long as Granny Nightshade remains in control of Thither, he sees no hope of escape.

**Gold-spun Gifts**

^gold-spun-gifts

#### Nib's Haunts

As Nib works, characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 11 or higher glimpse one or more apparitions lurking behind him. These apparitions take various forms, from a grubby child peering over Nib's shoulder to a gaunt coachman looming in the shadows at the back of the cave. Other possible apparitions include a long-faced woman dabbing at her tears with a handkerchief and a rail-thin waif wearing an eye patch. Quick as a candle's flicker, one apparition vanishes, and another appears. If the characters ask Nib about the apparitions, he explains the nature of his curse:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "I am haunted by my own words: as long as my ill-gotten gains were put to good use, my bad deeds would remain behind me. You are beholding the restless apparitions of those I hurt. They lurk behind my back, tormenting me with pokes at my ribs and whisperings in my ear. I can't bear to look them in the eye, not after what I did to them!"
^20b

Nib wears his blindfold to avoid inadvertently glancing over his shoulder or catching glimpses of the apparitions reflected in his piles of gold.

Nib warns the characters not to take any of his gold, lest they be cursed like him. Any character who steals gold from Nib's cave is haunted by 1d4 apparitions similar to those that haunt Nib. As a consequence of these hauntings, the character gains 1 level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) after finishing a long rest. Levels of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) gained from this effect cannot be removed until the character ends the haunting by returning the gold. A [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell ends the hauntings and automatically returns the stolen gold to the cave. A [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) or [greater restoration](/compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell cast on the culprit suppresses the effect for 24 hours.

Nib has been to Loomlurch, and has visited the goblin candy market (area L2), Granny Nightshade's parlor (area L3), and the workshop (area L4). If the characters ask Nib for more information about Granny Nightshade and Loomlurch, he imparts the following details:

- Granny Nightshade has a key protruding from her back that indicates her mood by how fast it turns. When she's happy, the key turns quickly. When she's upset, the key turns slowly. If she loses her temper, the key stops completely.
- Many children toil away in Granny Nightshade's workshop, crafting toys. Granny Nightshade delivers the creepiest toys to children on other worlds—to fill their heads with nightmares, one assumes. The hag makes her deliveries on the back of a flying rocking horse.
- Granny Nightshade is obsessed with capturing Will of the Feywild, a boy who helped a handful of younger children escape from Loomlurch. Will of the Feywild's motley group of rascals is known as the Getaway Gang. The gang is protected by a treant named Little Oak. (Nib's curse prevents him from leaving his cave, but he can point characters in the direction of Little Oak's favorite glade.)

### Little Oak

This encounter features a raggedy group of children called the Getaway Gang. Nib can provide directions to the treant that looks after the kids, or the characters can stumble across the treant's glade in their travels.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Up ahead, a small group of children frolics around a leafy oak tree, their gleeful yelps carrying through the forest. Painted swings dangle from the tree's branches. Nestled in its crown is a ramshackle treehouse.
^20d

The tree is a [treant](/compendium/bestiary/plant/treant.md) named Little Oak. If they see strangers, the children scamper up ladders and take cover in their treehouse. Their leader, Will of the Feywild, barks at the adventurers, "Stand down or face merry hell!" Little Oak provides a home for this gang of rascals, all of whom escaped captivity in Loomlurch with Will's help.

Adventurers who threaten the children incur the wrath of Little Oak, which uproots itself and thunders to their defense. If the treant or one of its animated trees reduces a character to 0 hit points with a melee attack, it knocks the character [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) instead of dealing a mortal wound. [Unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) characters are either tied up and questioned by Will or dragged to another part of the forest away from Little Oak.

If Little Oak is reduced to 0 hit points, the treant topples, destroying the Getaway Gang's treehouse and dealing 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage to each creature inside it.

#### Will of the Feywild

Will of the Feywild is not the spindly, 11-year-old boy he appears to be. He's an [oni](/compendium/bestiary/giant/oni.md) that has taken human form. His true name is Mugan, and he used to work for [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) as a kidnapper of children until the hag's sisters placed a curse on him that warmed his heart, changing his alignment from lawful evil to chaotic good. He now strives to help children escape from Skabatha's clutches. Skabatha assumes that Mugan simply left her employment; she is unaware of the curse her sisters placed on the oni and doesn't know that Will of the Feywild is not a human boy. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Will of the Feywild.

If the oni is affected by a spell that ends a curse, it regains its evil alignment and attacks whoever is responsible for lifting the curse, shouting, "How could you?" as it fights to the death.

The oni has a pet [displacer beast kitten](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast-kitten-wbtw.md) (see the accompanying stat block) named Star, which it abandons if its curse is ended. Characters who aided Dirlagraun in the Witchlight Carnival (see chapter 1) might guess that Star is the older displacer beast's offspring. If they show Star the mirrored ball, it leaps about excitedly. If he is told about Dirlagraun, Will of the Feywild reluctantly agrees to return Star to his parent, but only if the characters help him free the remaining children that are trapped in Loomlurch.

#### The Getaway Gang

The Getaway Gang has four members:

- Will of the Feywild, the gang's leader (described above)
- Bobi, a boisterous male dwarf growing his first whiskers
- Sloane, a sarcastic, ginger-haired female wood elf
- Zennor, a tenacious female orc

Bobi, Sloane, and Zennor are noncombatants (treat them as unarmed, chaotic good [commoners](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) who appear to be eight years old, but they are several years older and wiser than they look. The magic of the Feywild has kept them young.

Speaking to the Getaway Gang about Loomlurch yields the following information:

- A squad of tin soldiers defends Loomlurch, but they're easily lured away by distractions.
- The children being held captive in the workshop are haunted by boggles—oily creatures that sprout from the children's misery.
- Granny Nightshade imprisons her most hated enemies in a cell inside her kitchen.

##### Secret of Wayward Pool

Bobi, Sloane, and Zennor agree that the characters should pay a visit to Wayward Pool and seek out the unicorn Lamorna before heading to Loomlurch. Will is skeptical, because he thinks the unicorn is a "no-good goody-goody" who is too scared to challenge Granny Nightshade.

The Getaway Gang shares the following information about Wayward Pool if the characters express interest in going there:

- Only unicorns can reach the shore of Wayward Pool, but the magic protecting the pool can't tell the difference between a real unicorn and a make-believe one. To reach the lake themselves, the kids created a crude unicorn costume under which they can hide. (They keep the costume in their treehouse and can lend it to the characters, although it's big enough to hold only two adults.)
- Tying a wooden horn to one's head also bypasses the pool's magical ward.
- On a small island in the middle of the lake, the characters can find an iron bowl filled with fresh coals. Summoning the unicorn can be accomplished by lighting a fire in that bowl.

##### Guide to Yon

If the characters are searching for a guide to Yon, Will asks one of the other children to fetch Squirt, who is currently tucked away in Little Oak's treehouse.

#### Little Oak's Treehouse

The Getaway Gang's treehouse is big enough to accommodate up to twelve children comfortably. Rope ladders climb from the ground to a pair of trapdoors in the floor. When the characters can see inside the treehouse, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The floor of the treehouse is covered with blankets, cushions, and piles of straw. Hanging from the six-foot-high ceiling by a rope is a basket that holds apples, berries, sugarcane, and a few crumpled-up sheets of parchment. In one corner, lying on a cushion, is a rusty oilcan that looks out of place. Heaped in another corner is a crude unicorn costume made of polka-dot quilts and a wooden horse's head that has a wooden horn attached to it.
^213

The crumpled-up sheets of parchment in the basket are three of Granny Nightshade's wanted posters (see "Wanted Posters" earlier in the chapter). Roll on the Wanted Posters table to determine each poster, allowing for duplicates.

##### Oilcan

The oilcan is an animated Construct named [Squirt](/compendium/bestiary/npc/squirt-the-oilcan-wbtw.md) (see the accompanying stat block). Squirt's excesses and self-indulgences have left it feeling literally empty inside, and it doesn't have enough oil right now to use its Boggle Oil action. If the characters fill Squirt with more boggle oil, it offers to guide them from Thither to Yon. Squirt knows that Granny Nightshade's workshop employs boggles and can lead the group there. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Squirt.

##### Unicorn Costume

The Getaway Gang fashioned the unicorn costume so that they could reach the water at Wayward Pool and bathe in it. This costume is big enough to be worn by two adults or four children walking in single file. The wooden horse's head is mounted on a stick that the person in the lead holds up, and the children have glued a wooden horn to the horse's brow. Small holes in the fabric allow the costume's wearers to see where they're going under the covering.

##### Unicorn Horn

If the Story Tracker indicates that the unicorn horn is here, it replaces the wooden horn on the kids' unicorn costume. The children don't know that the horn is from a real unicorn.

#### Development

Will of the Feywild has conceived a daring plan to free the children still being held prisoner in Loomlurch, which he shares with the characters if they decide to aid him. Using a stick, Will sketches a rough map of the lair in the dirt and outlines the plan as follows:

- **The Approach.** Bobi, Sloane, Zennor, and Star will creep through the woods to the west of the tree and hide just out of sight of the screaming scarecrows (area L5). Meanwhile, Will will sneak around to the entrance to the kitchen (area L13) on the east side of the tree.
- **The Distraction.** The characters will enter the goblin market (area L2) posing as travelers, purchase some sweets, and arrange for a meeting with the hag. During the meeting, the children will alert the screaming scarecrows and thereby lure the tin soldiers into the garden.
- **The Escape.** While everyone is distracted, the characters will free the captives from the workshop (area L4) while Will climbs into the textile mill (area L12) to free the captives there. Once the children are set free, everyone will run back to Little Oak.

Will's plan is sketchy, but he likes to live by the seat of his pants. Regardless of how events unfold, he never reveals his true form, fearing it would terrify the children he's trying to rescue or frighten away the other members of the Getaway Gang. Consequently, he refrains from using his oni abilities in the presence of the children or the characters.

### Wayward Pool

Characters on their way to Loomlurch or Little Oak are likely to pass by Wayward Pool. When the characters first catch sight of this small lake, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Mist drifts over the surface of a small lake. Forested crags line the shore on one side of the lake, and mossy rocks protrude from the shallows. Near the center of the lake is a rocky islet.
^219

Those who try to come within 1,000 feet of the pool's shoreline find that any path they take through the forest leads them back to where they started, and flying creatures find themselves unintentionally veering off course. This glamor is the work of a unicorn named Lamorna, who has claimed Wayward Pool as her domain. To reach the shore, one must be a unicorn or adopt the guise of one. The Getaway Gang has a unicorn costume that can accommodate two characters; other characters can satisfy the pool's protective ward by attaching fake unicorn horns to their heads. False horns can easily be hewn from wood or created using a [silent image](/compendium/spells/silent-image.md) spell or similar magic.

The wizard [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md), founder of the League of Malevolence (see appendix B), has ordered the assassin [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) to hunt down Lamorna and chop off her horn. [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) lurks in the forested outskirts of the pool, trying to find a way to the shore. (He doesn't know about the "look like a unicorn" requirement.) Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 higher get the feeling they are being watched. See "Zarak Attacks!" below for more information.

#### Regional Effects

As long as Lamorna is alive, the following regional effects apply within 1,000 feet of the lake:

- All nonmagical flames in the region are extinguished. (A fire that's ignited in the bowl of coals on the lake's central island is an exception to this rule.)
- Beasts and Fey have advantage on all Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made in the region.
- Any creature that bathes in the lake for at least 1 minute can choose to end 1 level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) affecting it or one curse affecting it. Alternatively, the creature can end its attunement to one cursed magic item.

#### Summoning the Unicorn

Getting to the islet in the middle of the lake requires crossing 250 feet of fresh, still water. The lake is 30 feet deep, and the islet is 30 feet wide and 40 feet long.

Perched atop the islet's highest point, 30 feet above the surface of the water, is an iron bowl filled with coals. If a creature lights a fire in the bowl using the coals, Lamorna the [unicorn](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) appears on the lakeshore 1 minute later and waits for the characters there; otherwise, she remains hidden.

If Lamorna appears, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The lakeshore mists part to reveal a white horse with a single gleaming horn on her brow. She stands perfectly still, silently observing you.
^21c

Lamorna bolts into the forest if the adventurers make any threatening moves. Otherwise, she waits for one or more characters to approach within 60 feet of her, and then makes contact telepathically. Lamorna is curious to know why the group has come to Thither and is sympathetic toward anyone who has a grievance with the Hourglass Coven.

Lamorna can reveal the following information. As she speaks, the waters of the lake animate to form liquid sculptures of the things she describes:

- The domain of Prismeer once belonged to the archfey Zybilna, but was usurped by her cruel hag stepsisters: [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md), [Bavlorna Blightstraw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md), and [Endelyn Moongrave](/compendium/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md).
- Zybilna was vainglorious and deceitful at times, but her magic kept Prismeer safe and isolated. That situation ended when the hags of the Hourglass Coven captured Lamorna's mate, Elidon; stole his horn; and used its magic to imprison Zybilna in her stronghold, the Palace of Heart's Desire.
- Elidon's horn might be needed to free Zybilna, but Lamorna doesn't know the whereabouts of Elidon or his horn. She tells the characters that she believes Elidon is the hags' prisoner. (If Elidon had died, Lamorna believes she would've sensed it.)

Lamorna exhorts the characters to free Zybilna and save Prismeer from the evil hags. She tells them that one of Yon's denizens, [Amidor the dandelion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/amidor-the-dandelion-wbtw.md), can lead the group safely to the Palace of Heart's Desire. She offers Wayward Pool as a safe place to rest, if the characters need it. She can also describe the lake's magical properties (see "Regional Effects" above).

If the characters question Lamorna about the Palace of Heart's Desire, she reveals the following information:

- When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, no one could enter her palace without an invitation. It's unlikely that the Hourglass Coven is capable of enforcing similar restrictions on the palace.
- A library on the second floor of the palace contains Zybilna's most treasured tomes.
- A dragon-like creature called a jabberwock lives in Zybilna's palace and frequently prowls the forest. The jabberwock tries to reach Wayward Pool but is always turned away by the lake's protective magic. Lamorna emphasizes that the characters would be wise to avoid the jabberwock, for once it sets its fiery eyes on prey, it rarely gives up the hunt.

#### Zarak Attacks!

[Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) (see appendix B) follows the characters to the lakeshore, avoiding detection all the while. After seeing the characters adopt one or more unicorn disguises to reach the shore, he crafts a wooden fake unicorn horn, which he ties to his head with a leather belt strap and removes upon arriving at the lakeshore. He makes his assault as the characters' conversation with Lamorna winds down, taking advantage of the distraction provided by the characters to surprise the unicorn:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A cloaked figure springs from the forest and, with blades flashing, attacks the unicorn. Under the assassin's cowl, you see a wide, toothy smile.
^21e

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 17 or higher are not surprised by [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md). All other creatures in the area, including Lamorna, are surprised.

On Lamorna's first turn after the surprise round, she teleports away, denying [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) his prize and leaving him to face the characters alone. At this point, [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) is disgusted with himself for not felling the unicorn immediately ("I didn't know unicorns could do that," he mutters as Lamorna teleports away), but he's smart enough not to antagonize the characters any more than he already has. If the characters aren't spoiling for a fight, [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) is satisfied to stand down and retreat back into the forest.

[Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) is willing to give up his hunt in exchange for gold or if the characters seem likely to kill him. Characters who tell [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) about the riches in Nib's cave (see "Nib's Cave" earlier in the chapter) pique his greed; if he is led there, he takes all the gold he can carry and falls prey to Nib's curse.

The characters can try to capture [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md), but he'd rather die than surrender his weapons and his freedom. He's not much use as a hostage, since no other member of the League of Malevolence cares what happens to him, and he refuses to divulge the secret ways to and from the Palace of Heart's Desire. But if a [charm person](/compendium/spells/charm-person.md) spell or similar magic is used to make him friendly toward one or more of the characters, he can be coaxed into sharing the following information with them:

- Most of the creatures in Zybilna's palace, including Zybilna, are frozen in time. The hags of the Hourglass Coven used an artifact called [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) to accomplish this effect. [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) doesn't know exactly how the cauldron or its magic works.
- The self-proclaimed leader of the League of Malevolence is a human sorcerer named [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md). He wants to take custody of a magic staff belonging to his hated rival, the wizard [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md), who is among those frozen in Zybilna's palace. Apparently, a unicorn's horn is needed to free [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) from temporal stasis, which would then enable [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) to seize [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md)'s staff.
- [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md), a human priest of Orcus, is another member of the League of Malevolence. Although he hopes to challenge [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md)'s leadership one day, [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) won't do anything about it as long as [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) is protected by [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md), a mercenary who has a flame tongue longsword.
- A fifth member of the League of Malevolence, a human warlock named [Skylla](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skylla-wbtw.md), gets her magic from an archfey named Baba Yaga. [Skylla](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skylla-wbtw.md) knows more about [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) and the hags of the Hourglass Coven than anyone else (as far as [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) knows). But she has gone missing, and none of the other members of the league know where to find her.

#### Development

Lamorna's mate, Elidon, has been transformed into a flying rocking horse that Granny Nightshade rides as a mount. If the spell on Elidon is broken and he is reunited with Lamorna, she rewards each character with a _charm of heroism_ (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

## Loomlurch

Granny Nightshade's lair is built around a twisted workshop carved out of the interior of a gigantic oak that has fallen over.

The workshop is operated by kidnapped children who are allowed a small measure of freedom to carry out their labors, under the watchful eyes of the hag's minions.

Loomlurch has the following physical features:

- **Ceilings.** Unless otherwise noted, ceilings throughout Loomlurch are 8 feet high.
- **Doors.** Loomlurch's doors are made of sturdy wood with iron handles and fittings. All doors are unlocked unless the text says otherwise. As an action, a character using thieves' tools can make a successful DC 14 Dexterity check to pick the lock on a locked door, or a character can try to force a door open, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.
- **Floors, Walls, and Stairs.** Floors, walls, and staircases are hewn out of the wood of the giant tree.
- **Windows.** Loomlurch's windows are openable but are latched shut from the inside.

### Approaching Loomlurch

Describe Loomlurch to the players as their characters come within view of the site:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The forest is at its darkest here. Up ahead, a colossal dead oak lies on its side. Three living trees grow naturally out of its fallen remains. Their shapes resemble towers, with candlelit windows twinkling in the gloom and wooden balconies encircling gnarled branches. On one side of the fallen tree, firelight spills from a pair of quaint storefront windows, illuminating a clearing filled with merchant stalls.
^222

Characters arrive near the root bridges (area L1). Anyone who observes the workshop (area L4) can see diminutive figures prowling around inside: kidnapped children and boggles.

> [!quote] Double, Double, Toil and Trouble
> 
> If the characters drive [Bavlorna Blightstraw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md) from her home in chapter 2, the hag takes refuge with her sister, [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md), and spends all her time in the study (area L14), poring through Skabatha's ritual books for a clever spell to overcome the characters or feeling sorry for herself. The two hags avoid each other as much as possible. Whenever they squabble, which is often, Skabatha ridicules her sister for Bavlorna's failure at the hands of the characters.
^double-double-toil-and-trouble

Before the party enters Loomlurch, Will of the Feywild—if he is present—outlines his plan for rescuing Granny Nightshade's child captives (see "Getaway Gang Raid"). Characters who have not earned Will's assistance must devise their own plan for getting inside.

### Where's Skabatha?

All of Loomlurch's denizens are aware of Granny Nightshade's daily routine, which is as follows:

- After waking from a long rest, she putters about in her garden (area L5) for 1d3 hours.
- Most of her day is spent in the kitchen (area L13), with occasional visits to the study (area L14).
- Before going to bed, the hag spends 1 hour conducting an inspection of the sewing room (area L9), the textile mill (area L12), and the workshop (area L4). After the inspection, Granny Nightshade moves to her bedroom (area L16), miniaturizes herself, and takes a long rest inside the dollhouse there.

Visitors can arrange a meeting with Skabatha by speaking to Chucklehead the goblin boss (in area L2) or Pincushion the living doll (in area L9). Any such meeting with the hag takes place in the parlor (area L3).

See appendix B for a description of [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) and a summary of her rivalries with her sisters.

#### Bargaining with Skabatha

If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook and the Story Tracker indicates that Skabatha has one or more things in her possession that the characters desire, Skabatha claims undisputable ownership of these lost things, asserting that she acquired them "fair and square." Even so, she is willing to negotiate with characters who want to procure them. She is also inclined to strike bargains with characters who have other needs.

In exchange for one thing in her possession that a character has lost, Skabatha demands the characters complete one of the following quests:

- **Capture Will.** Capture the brigand Will of the Feywild and bring him to Granny Nightshade alive. He's sure to be hiding somewhere in the forest.
- **Find the Lost Horn.** Bring her the unicorn horn that she says her sister Bavlorna recently lost. Maybe Prismeer's native denizens can help the characters find it.
- **Spoil a Play.** Sabotage a theatrical performance in Motherhorn, [Endelyn Moongrave](/compendium/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md)'s castle in Yon (see chapter 4). Skabatha would like nothing more than to see her sister bought down a peg or two. (To get to Yon, the characters will need a guide. Granny Nightshade expects them to know this fact and offers no help in finding a guide or seeing them safely to Yon.)

Skabatha is true to her word, returning one lost thing for each task completed while offering no assistance toward accomplishing the tasks. Skabatha used the lost things to fashion minor magic items, all of which she keeps in her dollhouse (area L16).

#### Skabatha's Clockwork Key

The clockwork key embedded in Skabatha's back rotates quickly when she's in a good mood and slows down as her mood sours. When she is furious, the key comes to a dead stop. When the key stops turning, Skabatha attacks objects or creatures indiscriminately until something lifts her spirits and quells her rage, such as the defeat of an enemy or some other triumph, whereupon her key starts turning again. Whenever Skabatha loses her temper and turns violent, 1d3 redcaps sprout in her garden (see area L15 and "Skabatha's Minions" below).

The key can't be removed from Skabatha's back while she lives, and it serves no function in the adventure other than to reflect her current mood.

#### Defeating Skabatha

In dire circumstances, Skabatha flees Loomlurch on her flying rocking horse mount (see area L6) and retreats to Motherhorn, the lair of her youngest sister, Endelyn (see chapter 4). If [Bavlorna Blightstraw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md) is in Loomlurch, she flees to Motherhorn as well.

If Skabatha is slain, a beetle emerges from her rotten flesh and whispers [Endelyn Moongrave](/compendium/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md)'s weakness to Skabatha's killer: "Endelyn fears eclipses, not just real ones but symbolic ones as well. If you want to kill her, best do it during an eclipse, or her body will re-form."

#### Skabatha's Ring of Keys

If the characters defeat Skabatha or successfully pick her pocket, they can obtain a ring of three iron keys that she keeps on her person:

- The first key locks and unlocks the doors leading from the garden (area L5) to the workshop (area L4) and the sewing room (area L9), and the door between areas L6 and L11.
- The second key locks and unlocks the doors to the kitchen (area L13) and Mishka's chains there.
- The third key locks and unlocks the door to the cell in the kitchen (area L13).

### Skabatha's Minions

Granny Nightshade entrusts Loomlurch's defense to various creatures, as described below. The hag's minions, except for the redcaps, have orders to capture intruders alive and bring them before her.

#### Boggles

The despair of Loomlurch's children has given rise to six [boggles](/compendium/bestiary/fey/boggle-mpmm.md) (see appendix C), three in area L4 and three in area L12. These cowardly creatures aren't loyal to the hag, yet she tolerates them for the distress they cause the children.

#### Cradlefall

This [green dragon wyrmling](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling.md) likes to hide in painted wooden boxes, of which there are three: one each in areas L3, L6, and L7. Each box is 3 feet on a side and has a hinged lid. A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around a box. A crank protruding from one side of the box attaches to a tiny metal music box mounted to the wooden box's inside wall. Winding the crank causes the music box to play a 10-second tune reminiscent of a child's lullaby. As the final note sounds, roll a d8. If the roll is 3 or lower and Cradlefall has not yet been defeated, the wyrmling bursts out like a jack-in-the-box, attacking creatures he considers his enemies. If the wyrmling has been dealt with, the lid springs open, but the box is empty.

While curled up in a box with the lid closed, Cradlefall can use an action to teleport himself and anything he is holding to another closed box in Loomlurch. When he is not hiding in a box, Cradlefall curls up in front of the oven in Granny Nightshade's kitchen (area L13). Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Cradlefall.

#### Redcaps

Whenever Skabatha's windup key runs down, her anger boils over, causing 1d3 murderous [redcaps](/compendium/bestiary/fey/redcap-mpmm.md) (see appendix C) to sprout in area L15. These redcaps are too hateful to serve as guards, so Skabatha sends them scuttling off into Thither to wreak havoc. Until she does so, the redcaps remain in area L15 and attack other creatures on sight.

#### Tin Soldiers

These [ten automatons](/compendium/bestiary/construct/tin-soldier-wbtw.md) are fashioned to look like stout infantry soldiers, and they obey Skabatha without question. Six of them remain in the barracks (area L7), and the remaining four patrol the balconies outside areas L8 and L12. They charge forth to investigate any suspicious activity they see or hear, meaning that they are easily distracted. Each one is a Small (3-foot-tall) suit of [animated armor](/compendium/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md) with 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points.

### Lost Children

Over the years, Skabatha's minions have lured children from the Witchlight Carnival to Thither, allowing the hag to trap them in her workshop. Locked in an eternal battle with hardship, these unfortunates never grow old and have no hope of escape. The hag keeps the children safe and healthy, since to do otherwise would cause them to vanish (see "Children of Prismeer" in chapter 2). The hag's minions likewise have strict orders not to physically harm the children.

**Lost Children**

| Child | Location | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Naal (11-year-old male drow) | L4 | Stole the key to the kitchen door |
| Sung (9-year-old female human) | L4 | — |
| Philomena (8-year-old female lightfoot halfling) | L4 | Won't leave Loomlurch without Oink the pig |
| Brottor (10-year-old male hill dwarf) | L8 | Gravely ill after eating nightshade |
| Pud (12-year-old male human) | L8 | Secretly loyal to Granny Nightshade |
| Wendel (11-year-old male strongheart halfling) | L9 | — |
| Roff (10-year-old female bugbear) | L9 | Stole a pouch of [dust of corrosion](/compendium/items/dust-of-corrosion-wbtw.md) |
| Yevelda (8-year-old female goblin) | L12 | Knows a secret route into Granny Nightshade's bedroom |
| Callybon (11-year-old female forest gnome) | L12 | — |
| Pogo (9-year-old male forest gnome) | L12 | — |
| Mishka (9-year-old female human) | L13 | Chained to a worktable |
^lost-children

The Lost Children table identifies the children currently held captive inside Loomlurch and their locations when the characters arrive. As time passes, the children can move about the lair, at your discretion. They stay clear of danger and play no role in combat. All of them are chaotic good.

Children free of Granny Nightshade's tyranny have no easy way to return home, but they can take refuge at Little Oak's treehouse or be left in the care of the unicorn Lamorna at Wayward Pool. The dwarf [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) (see area L13) insists on remaining in Thither to care for the children if no one else will. If Zybilna is freed from her stasis, she returns the children to their proper homes.

### Loomlurch Locations

The following descriptions are keyed to the map of Loomlurch.

#### L1. Root Bridges

These two bridges have the same features. When the characters first approach one of them, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A gnarled bridge formed by tangled tree roots spans a rocky, dried-up riverbed.
^231

The bridges sway and creak when crossed. To avoid making a racket, each creature traveling along a bridge must make a DC 12 Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. On a failed check, the creatures stationed in the goblin market (area L2) are alerted; they take no action immediately but can't be surprised.

#### L2. Goblin Market

The characters can enter this area from the eastern root bridge or by traversing the adjoining woodland.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Three stalls selling candy are situated in this clearing, lit by windows carved into the giant fallen tree to one side of it. Two goblins are working in each stall, and the whole enterprise is watched closely by a goblin with a toffee apple head who appears to be muttering quietly to himself.
^233

This market sells goblin-made candies of all sorts. Six [goblins](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) (lawful neutral) work here, two per stall, under the watchful gaze of their [goblin boss](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin-boss.md), Chucklehead (neutral), whose head has been reshaped by fey magic to look like a toffee apple. The stallholders greet patrons warmly and invite them to sample and buy their delicious wares. Meanwhile, Chucklehead watches out for thieves.

##### Chucklehead

The goblin boss can escort characters to the parlor (area L3) if they request a meeting with Granny Nightshade. When left alone, he mutters to himself as though he's having a constant but mild crisis of conscience. If the characters ask Chucklehead whom he's muttering to, he says that a maggot crawled into his head and is slowly eating it from the inside out. He's not sad about this turn of events because it has changed his outlook and disposition, making him kinder and more sympathetic to the plight of others. He claims he can speak to the maggot and it speaks to him, even though it actually doesn't. The maggot in the goblin's head will kill him in 30 days unless he receives the benefit of magic that cures a disease. That magic slays the maggot but also reverts Chucklehead's alignment to neutral evil.

Chucklehead is protective of Mishka (see area L13) and wants to help her get away from Loomlurch, but he's too scared of Granny Nightshade to free Mishka from the hag's clutches. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Chucklehead.

##### Merchant Stalls

The goods sold here are delicious but made with disgusting ingredients. Examples include beetles encased in hard candy, lollipops made from compacted ants, and jellied worms. The stallholders charge one trinket per treat. Roll a d8 and consult the Candy Treats table to determine what magical effect befalls a creature that eats one of these treats. Each effect lasts for 1 hour.

If a creature eats multiple treats and gets the same effect twice, extend the duration of the effect by 1 hour. A creature can have up to three different magical effects on it at any given time. If a creature eats a candy treat while it is already affected by three others, don't roll on the table. Instead, the creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw; on a failed save, the creature is [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 8 hours.

**Candy Treats**

| dice: d8 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Your footfalls emit musical notes that can be heard out to a range of 30 feet. |
| 2 | Eating the candy causes you to foam at the mouth, making it difficult (but not impossible) for you to speak. |
| 3 | Your fingers leave indelible stains on anything you touch. |
| 4 | Your head swells to twice its normal size. |
| 5 | You shrink, as though affected by the reduce effect of an [enlarge/reduce](/compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell. |
| 6 | Fireflies are drawn to you and form a persistent cloud around you, shedding bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. |
| 7 | You grow, as though affected by the enlarge effect of an [enlarge/reduce](/compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell. |
| 8 | You are targeted by a [polymorph](/compendium/spells/polymorph.md) spell and automatically fail the saving throw against it. The new form is a butterfly (use the [bat](/compendium/bestiary/beast/bat.md) stat block, but omit its [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision), Echolocation trait, and Bite attack). |
^candy-treats

#### L3. Parlor

The door to area L4 is closed but not locked.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This chamber is nestled between walls of twisted roots, through gaps in which you can see the eerily beautiful woodland surrounding you. A closed wooden door stands opposite the root bridge that leads into this room, in the center of which are four armchairs encircling a small table laid out for a tea service. A painted wooden box three feet on a side rests in a corner. A crank protrudes from one side of it, causing it to resemble an oversized jack-in-the-box.
^238

If [Bavlorna Blightstraw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md) retreated to Loomlurch after fleeing her home in chapter 2, her [bobbing lily pad](/compendium/items/bobbing-lily-pad-wbtw.md) (see appendix A) lies on the floor next to the box, vaguely resembling a leaf-shaped carpet. Bavlorna herself can be found in area L14.

Three of the armchairs are trained [mimics](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.md) in disguise. They are magically compelled to remain in this room and adhere to creatures only when Granny Nightshade orders them to do so. The mimics are trained in nonlethal combat; characters reduced to 0 hit points by the mimics are stable rather than dying, giving the hag a chance to decide what to do with the [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) victims.

##### Dragon-in-the-Box

The wooden box with the crank is one of the boxes where [Cradlefall](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling.md) might be found (see "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter).

##### Tea with Granny Nightshade

Characters who arrange a meeting with Granny Nightshade through Chucklehead (area L2) or Pincushion (area L9) are left here for a while before the hag shows up. When Granny Nightshade arrives, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The door creaks open, and a little old woman totters forward. She wears a grimy, old-fashioned shawl, and her skin looks like gnarled bark. A large iron key extends from her back, ticking rhythmically as it rotates.
> 
> "Sit down, children," she says in a voice reminiscent of crunching leaves. "Let's have some tea."
^23c

[Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) (see appendix B) obeys the rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2) and presents herself as a kind host who is keen to know why the characters have paid her a visit. See "Bargaining with Skabatha" for guidance on running this conversation, during which she pours tea into filthy cups and stirs the liquid with a chicken bone, insisting that the characters drink up. On occasion, she reaches around with one of her arms and winds up her key. If the characters belittle or threaten her, Granny Nightshade orders her mimics to adhere to her guests and beat them [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) while she watches with amusement.

##### Treasure

Characters who scour the parlor for treasure find the following items:

- A spell scroll of [speak with plants](/compendium/spells/speak-with-plants.md) tucked in a side table drawer
- A set of four silver teaspoons engraved with pained facial expressions (5 gp per spoon)
- A bronze candlestick shaped like a bird's leg (10 gp)

#### L4. Workshop

The doors to areas L3 and L7 are closed but not locked. The door to area L5 is locked, and Granny Nightshade has the only key (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Flickering lanterns illuminate a cluttered workshop filled with soft, ambient music produced by bells and chimes. Parts of toys are heaped on the tables—leering doll's heads, half-built rocking horses, unpainted wooden balls, and the stuffed limbs of soft toys. A stove at the back of the room holds a saucepan of smelting metal. Three doors exit the workshop, and two storefront windows overlook the market outside.
^23f

The ambient music is a permanent magical effect that can't be heard outside the workshop. If the characters enter quietly, add:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Three young children are gathered around a wooden worktable. The eldest, a drow boy, prances on the tabletop with a bar of soap in one hand, while a halfling girl and a human girl giggle at his audacity.
^240

Granny Nightshade makes captured children craft nightmarish toys in this workshop. Three children are present when the characters arrive: Naal (an 11-year-old male drow), Sung (a 9-year-old female human), and Philomena (an 8-year-old female lightfoot halfling). They've been the hag's prisoners for longer than any of them can remember and are wary of grown-ups. If the characters barge into the room, Philomena panics and runs to get help from the [tin soldiers](/compendium/bestiary/construct/tin-soldier-wbtw.md) in area L7. All three children want to escape the hag's clutches, although Philomena weeps if she's forced to leave without her beloved piglet, Oink, who is kept in the pigpen (area L5).

Naal recently stole the kitchen key from Pincushion (see area L9) and took an impression of it using a bar of soap before fastening the key back onto Pincushion's belt. When the characters arrive, Naal is recounting his heroic tale to the two girls. He wants to create a copy of the key and then sneak into the kitchen to steal milk. Naal gives characters the bar of soap if they give him something in return, such as fresh milk or some other tasty treat. ("It's the rule of recip—... recip—... give-and-get," he says.)

##### Boggles

Three [boggles](/compendium/bestiary/fey/boggle-mpmm.md) (see appendix C) lurk in the shadows, intending to play pranks on the visitors. Characters who spend a minute or so inside the workshop notice unsettling changes; dolls' heads turn to face them when they're not looking, balls bounce suddenly out of dark corners, or molten tin from the smelting pot splashes on the floor nearby. A character can use an action to try to detect hidden creatures, spotting all three boggles with a successful DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. If they are spotted, the boggles flee to the box in area L7 and turn its crank, hoping Cradlefall will pop out of the box and defend them. The boggles avoid combat themselves.

If Squirt is with the party, it encourages the characters to acquire as much boggle oil as they can. Only slippery boggle oil will do (see the "Boggle Oil" sidebar). Captured boggles provide the oil freely, hoping to earn their freedom.

##### Treasure

Characters who ransack the workshop uncover the following valuables:

- A jar of iridescent glass eyes (10 gp)
- A silver hammer and chisel in a green leather tool belt (15 gp for the set)
- Iron metalworking tongs shaped like the jaws of a snapping dragon (15 gp)

> [!quote] Boggle Oil
> 
> A [boggle](/compendium/bestiary/fey/boggle-mpmm.md) excretes oil from its pores and can make the oil slippery or sticky. [Squirt the oilcan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/squirt-the-oilcan-wbtw.md) needs slippery boggle oil to use its Boggle Oil action, and it can hold up to three applications of the oil. Boggle oil normally evaporates after 1 hour, but the oil is preserved indefinitely inside Squirt.
> 
> When a boggle creates a puddle of slippery oil on the ground, a character can scoop up 1d3 applications of the oil from the puddle (a process that takes 1 minute) before the oil disappears.
> 
> A friendly boggle will create three applications of boggle oil in exchange for a gift of equal perceived value, such as a trinket. An indifferent boggle expects a better gift for the same amount of oil, such as a bag of candy, a gemstone, or a magnifying glass. An unfriendly or hostile boggle won't cooperate unless it is captured and forced to create oil to avoid punishment.
^boggle-oil

##### Window Displays

The following creepy toys are displayed in the workshop windows:

- A set of nesting dolls in which each doll looks more frightened than the next larger one
- A stuffed lion with needles for teeth and real bloodstains around its jaws
- A toy windmill with a crank on one side that turns the vanes and the millstone
- A set of playing cards depicting weeping children
- A wind-up drunkard doll that totters a few paces and then falls over
- Four finger puppets depicting an arguing family
- A 1-foot-tall wooden guillotine
- A tiny wooden box containing eight sticks of black chalk

#### L5. Granny Nightshade's Garden

This outdoor garden extends almost the entire length of Loomlurch. The doors to areas L4 and L9 are locked, and Granny Nightshade has the only key that unlocks them (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter). Three balconies overlooking the garden connect to areas L8, L9, and L12, respectively. The balcony outside area L9 is only 5 feet above the ground; the others are 20 feet high.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A woodland basin filled with plants and fungi stretches out along one side of the fallen tree. A pumpkin patch is at one end of the garden, next to a steaming compost heap, with ramshackle pens for pigs and goats at the opposite end. Bedraggled scarecrows hang from tall wooden stakes in the basin's wooded slope. Two ground-level doors and three balconies provide entry to the hag's lair.
^247

[Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) (see appendix B) uses the garden to cultivate ingredients for her potions and candies. The hag spends a few hours here each day tending to her plants (see Where's Skabatha? earlier in the chapter). Characters who won the game of hide-and-seek in the Witchlight Carnival's Pixie Kingdom have advantage on any Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in the garden.

##### Animal Pens

The pens contain seven [goats](/compendium/bestiary/beast/goat.md), five adult pigs (use the [boar](/compendium/bestiary/beast/boar.md) stat block), and a Small piglet (noncombatant) named Oink, who is beloved by Philomena (see area L4).

##### Compost Heap

The compost heap is a [shambling mound](/compendium/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) that remains motionless until it is disturbed or until it rises to attack. If the mound is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the mound moving or acting, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to discern that the mound is animate.

Granny Nightshade earlier took a cutting from the shambling mound's root stem, binding it to her service. If a character uses a [speak with plants](/compendium/spells/speak-with-plants.md) spell to communicate with the shambling mound, it tells the character that the creature must obey the hag until its stolen root is returned to it. If a character promises to return the root to it, the shambling mound stops attacking and waits here for the characters to come back. If the root is brought back and given to it, the shambling mound goes on a rampage through the garden, destroying and devouring everything it can while leaving the characters and their allies unmolested, then shambles into the forest, never to return. The cutting can be found inside one of the cookbooks in area L13.

##### Mushrooms and Toadstools

Granny Nightshade grows many kinds of Feywild fungi, five of which have useful (and in some cases magical) properties. Roll 3d8 to determine how many of each mushroom can be harvested from this location. A character who examines a certain kind of mushroom can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check, ascertain its properties:

- **Butterfly Saddle.** Each of these bright yellow toadstools has a ruffled, saddle-shaped cap properly sized for a pixie or sprite to sit on. They taste like butter and can be used as a substitute for that ingredient in recipes.
- **Eldercap.** Eating one of these white and gray mushrooms causes the eater to look much older for 1 hour. This magical effect is an illusion that can be ended with a [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell.
- **Executioner's Hood.** Each of these mushrooms has a black, hood-shaped cap. Any creature that consumes an executioner's hood must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death. This magical effect is identical to that of the [feign death](/compendium/spells/feign-death.md) spell (including its duration).
- **Hummingbrella.** A hummingbrella is a colorful mushroom with a frilly, parasol-shaped cap that drips sweet nectar and attracts hummingbirds. Eating one has the same effect as drinking antitoxin.
- **Pricklenoggin.** Each of these mushrooms has short, prickly spines growing out of its red cap. Hats made from pricklenoggin caps are popular in the fey courts and considered very fashionable. Most tiny Fey would be grateful to receive one as a gift.

##### Plant Beds

Many plants grow in Granny Nightshade's garden—licorice, sugarcane, marshmallow, and more. Characters who examine the plant beds discover a dark secret: each bed is nourished by the buried remains of a Humanoid. Mud-encrusted skulls protrude from the soil, with vegetation sprouting from their open jaws and eye sockets. As an action once per day, Granny Nightshade can raise eight [skeletons](/compendium/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) from the earth, but she must be within 30 feet of the plant beds to use this power.

##### Pumpkin Patch and Staircase

Several large pumpkins grow in one spot amid thick, leafy vines. A wooden staircase on the edge of the pumpkin patch ascends to a 20-foot-high wooden balcony outside area L8.

If a creature other than Granny Nightshade or a Small Humanoid (such as a human child or a halfling) enters the pumpkin patch, three fat pumpkins burst open, and a [giant poisonous snake](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-poisonous-snake.md) slithers out of each of them. Granny Nightshade has cast an [awaken](/compendium/spells/awaken.md) spell on each of these snakes, giving it an Intelligence score of 10 and the ability to speak Common. Their names are Essaveth, Jahassi, and Sinius. They act as watchdogs, but they won't climb stairs. If one of these snakes is wounded, it slithers into the pumpkin patch on its next turn, gaining total cover. On subsequent turns, it tries to hide and has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks as long as the pumpkin patch provides cover.

##### Screaming Scarecrows

Five scarecrows are staked in a line near the pumpkin patch, and a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each one. If an intruder moves within 50 feet of any of them, all five scarecrows scream loudly enough to alert everyone inside Loomlurch. Each scarecrow is a Medium object with AC 11, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

#### L6. Rocking Horse

The door to area L11 is locked, and Granny Nightshade has the only key (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter). If Skabatha has been forced to flee Loomlurch on her flying rocking horse, modify the following boxed text to remove all mention of the horse:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Creaking softly, a rocking horse moves back and forth near the door. Peeling paint covers its limbs, and its rocker is thick with moss. A rictus grin is painted on its face. Near a protruding root is a painted wooden box three feet on a side. A crank protrudes from one side of it, causing it to resemble an oversized jack-in-the-box.
^250

The rocking horse is actually a [flying rocking horse](/compendium/bestiary/construct/flying-rocking-horse-wbtw.md) (see the accompanying stat block) that Granny Nightshade uses to soar across Prismeer. The horse is positioned so that it can attack trespassers who approach the door. Any character who gets within 5 feet of the rocking horse notices a depression on its forehead. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence check correctly intuits that a horn once protruded from this depression.

The rocking horse used to be a unicorn named Elidon until the hags of the Hourglass Coven turned it into an obedient Construct. If a character finds Elidon's lost unicorn horn and places it on the rocking horse's brow while the horse has at least 1 hit point remaining, the curse is broken and the rocking horse magically transforms into the [unicorn](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) Elidon, who appears at full health. Elidon is happy to repay the characters for their heroism but is equally eager to return to his mate, Lamorna (see "Wayward Pool" earlier in the chapter). Convincing him to join the party requires a successful DC 17 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

Whether he stays with the party or not, Elidon intends to honor the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2) and offers to use his magic to aid the characters in the following ways before parting company with them:

- He can use his Healing Touch action to treat a character's wounds and remove any poisons or diseases afflicting that character.
- Once a day, he can teleport himself and up to three willing party members to any location in Thither up to 1 mile away.
- He can cast [pass without trace](/compendium/spells/pass-without-trace.md) on himself and the entire party at will. This spell requires Elidon's concentration and lasts for up to 1 hour.

##### Dragon-in-the-Box

The wooden box with the crank is one of the boxes where [Cradlefall](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling.md) might be found (see "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter).

#### L7. Tin Soldier Barracks

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Ten brightly painted structures resembling little wooden houses line the walls of this room. Each small house has a three-foot-high hinged door. Four of the doors are open, and the other six are closed.
> 
> A narrow staircase ascends the circular wall. Near the foot of the stairs is a painted wooden box three feet on a side. A crank protrudes from one side of it, causing it to resemble an oversized jack-in-the-box.
^254

The staircase ends after 20 feet at a landing outside area L8.

Each small house is designed to hold one of Granny Nightshade's [tin soldiers](/compendium/bestiary/construct/tin-soldier-wbtw.md). When the characters arrive, four soldiers are on patrol in areas L8 and L12, and the remaining six tin soldiers are inside their domiciles, behind closed doors. Each of these six Constructs is a Small (3-foot-tall) suit of [animated armor](/compendium/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md) with 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points.

The tin soldiers burst from their small houses and march forth if they hear combat in this room or an adjoining area, or if Skabatha or Pincushion calls for them. If the characters witness the soldiers emerge, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The beat of a drum erupts from out of the woodwork as all six small doors spring open at once. A troop of cask-shaped tin soldiers marches into view. A drum waddles behind one of them on stocky legs, striking itself with a pair of tiny drumstick arms.
^255

The six tin soldiers operate as a unit and march to the beat of the drum, which is a Small animated object with AC 16, 25 hit points, a walking speed of 30 feet, [blindsight](/rules/senses.md#blindsight) out to a range of 30 feet, and no effective attacks. Its ability scores are Strength 6, Dexterity 14, Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. The drum can't be [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [deafened](/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [paralyzed](/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified), or [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), and it's immune to poison and psychic damage. Its drumbeat can be heard out to a range of 60 feet. All tin soldiers that can hear the beating drum gain a +2 bonus to their damage rolls. If the drum is destroyed, every tin soldier within 60 feet of it is [stunned](/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn.

##### Dragon-in-the-Box

The wooden box with the crank is one of the boxes where [Cradlefall](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling.md) might be found (see "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter).

#### L8. Workhouse Dormitory

Two 3-foot-tall tin soldiers patrol the balcony outside this room. Each [tin soldier](/compendium/bestiary/construct/tin-soldier-wbtw.md) is a Small suit of [animated armor](/compendium/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md) with 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points. The doors leading to this room are closed but unlocked.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This dormitory nestles in the tree boughs and has round windows overlooking a wooden balcony. Lining the walls are ten child-sized bunks outfitted with patchwork quilts and straw-stuffed pillows.
> 
> A young male dwarf lies in one of the bunks, coughing and drenched in sweat, while an older lad mops his brow with water from a bucket. Two doors exit the room: one leads to a balcony, the other deeper into the tree.
^259

Granny Nightshade's workers sleep in these bunks. When the characters arrive, two children are present: Brottor (a 10-year-old male hill dwarf) and Pud (a 12-year-old male human). Brottor is poisoned; he fell gravely ill after eating nightshade from the garden. Pud has been assigned to care for him until the malady passes or Brottor dies.

Pud hisses for the characters to be quiet, nodding toward the soldiers on the balcony. If the characters comply, Pud quietly describes Granny Nightshade's routine and all of her minions (see Where's Skabatha? and "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter). Characters who are suspicious of Pud can make a DC 12 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check; on a successful check, a character discerns that Pud is untrustworthy. (In fact, he's deciding whether to betray the characters to the hag.) If one or more characters are mean to him, Pud slips off at the first opportunity to alert Skabatha, hoping that his loyalty to her will pay off for him in the future.

##### Curing Brottor

Any effect that neutralizes poison can cure Brottor. If the characters lack the means to cure Brottor on their own, they can use hummingbrella mushrooms (found in areas L5 and L13) to neutralize the poison.

If his ailment remains untreated, the dwarf falls into a coma after 5 hours. A character who administers to the dwarf for 1 hour and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check can delay the onset of the coma for an additional 1d4 + 1 hours.

If the characters save Brottor's life, Pud silently vows not to betray them to the hag.

##### Treasure

Characters who search the dormitory uncover the following valuable items:

- A silver bookmark shaped like a feather (5 gp)
- A gold signet ring depicting a weeping willow (25 gp)
- A cracked bloodstone (25 gp) stuffed inside a pillowcase

#### L9. Sewing Room

A closed, unlocked door connects this room to a 5-foot-high wooden balcony that overlooks Granny Nightshade's garden (area L5).

> "Dunderhead!" cries a scratchy voice as you enter this cluttered chamber. "Those tatty sleeves wouldn't serve as socks for a chicken. Start again!"
> 
> A plump halfling boy and a young, fluffy bugbear sit at work benches, watched over by a living, child-sized doll with buttons for eyes. An animated carpet prances around the children, who pay it no attention. The sewing room contains rolls of fabric, bobbins of thread, knitting needles, and pincushions.
^25e

Materials for the workshop are sewn here under the watchful gaze of Pincushion, a [living doll](/compendium/bestiary/construct/living-doll-wbtw.md) (see appendix C for its stat block). The prancing carpet is a [rug of smothering](/compendium/bestiary/construct/rug-of-smothering.md) that defends Pincushion and keeps strangers away from the children. Pincushion carries a key that locks and unlocks the doors to the kitchen (area L13). The key dangles from a hoop attached to its waist.

The living doll challenges intruders and demands to know why they're trespassing here. To satisfy it, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. On a failed check, Pincushion hollers for the tin soldiers at area L7. If satisfied, Pincushion asks the characters to wait here while it hurries to notify Skabatha of the newcomers' presence. The rug stays behind to make sure the children don't leave. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Pincushion.

##### Children

Two children are working here when the characters arrive: Wendel (an 11-year-old male strongheart halfling) and Roff (a 10-year-old female bugbear). Roff recently stole a pouch of [dust of corrosion](/compendium/items/dust-of-corrosion-wbtw.md) (see appendix A) from the store cupboard in area L10. She conceals the pouch in her clothing and offers it to her saviors if rescued from the tyranny of Pincushion and the rug.

##### Treasure

Once the living doll leaves or is defeated, the characters can search the sewing room for treasure, finding the following valuable items:

- A spool of barbed, golden yarn (15 gp)
- Three bolts of silk in shades of putrid green and cesspit brown (10 gp each)
- A set of five painted thimbles depicting poisonous Feywild plants (25 gp for the set)

#### L10. Cupboards

The doors in this chamber are closed but not locked. When the characters enter for the first time, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Moths cluster around a lantern that hangs from the ceiling in the middle of a hallway, casting flitting shadows on the walls. The hall contains three sliding doors along the walls, and a heavier hinged door stands at the opposite end.
^263

The three cupboards, accessed by sliding the doors open, hold workshop supplies, boxes of junk, and other mundane bric-a-brac. If one or more characters spend at least 15 minutes searching a cupboard, they find 1d4 trinkets inside it (each one determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets table in the introduction).

##### Large Cupboard

If the characters didn't dispose of her in chapter 1, Sowpig stands in the middle of the largest cupboard, silent and unmoving. She is a Small [ghoul](/compendium/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) with 17 (5d6) hit points. Moths that live in the cupboard have encased Sowpig's body in silk. Opening the cupboard door releases a swarm of moths, which is harmless and always moves toward the nearest light source. Any space that it occupies is lightly obscured.

After the swarm has been released, Sowpig emerges from her silk cocoon to ask why she has been disturbed. The ghoul assumes that the characters are Granny Nightshade's workers, sent to fetch her for a new task. She has no interest in the day-to-day affairs of Loomlurch and attacks the characters only if they threaten Granny Nightshade in the ghoul's presence or seem particularly suspicious. Sowpig follows them through the lair and shares an occasional joke, which is always dark and upsetting. Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Sowpig.

##### Unicorn Horn

If the Story Tracker indicates that the unicorn horn is here, characters can find it in Sowpig's cupboard, buried in a box full of junk.

#### L11. Family Tree

The door to L10 is closed but not locked, and the doors to areas L6 and L13 are both locked. Granny Nightshade carries keys to both of these doors (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter), and Pincushion (see area L9) has a spare key to area L13. The staircase in this room climbs 20 feet to a landing that ends outside area L12.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This room has three doors and a wood-carved staircase that ascends to a higher level. The walls are a dense tangle of tree roots and brambles, nestled among which are five animated portraits: one of a svelte, dark-haired woman and the others depicting hags.
^268

When the characters arrive, the portraits show images of Granny Nightshade and her family, with no labels to identify them:

- A truly ancient and terrifying hag (Baba Yaga, the Mother of Witches)
- A toadish hag ([Bavlorna Blightstraw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md), as depicted in appendix B)
- A skeletal hag wearing a black, theatrical contraption resembling a dress ([Endelyn Moongrave](/compendium/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md), as depicted in appendix B)
- A hag with a wind-up key in her back, one empty eye socket, and a wooden eye held in her hand ([Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md), as depicted in appendix B)
- A svelte, dark-haired woman with a commanding presence (her appearance matching that of the Tasha mannequin outside the Hall of Illusions in the Witchlight Carnival, as described in chapter 1)

The portraits are enchanted to display the last creature that pricked its skin on the brambles' thorns in addition to its four closest family members, if it has any. These family members can be living or dead. (If the creature has fewer than four close family members, any remaining portraits are blank.) Each portrait magically animates to create the impression that the subject is looking around and shifting uncomfortably, but the animation has the quality of an old movie. The moving images are silent.

##### Pricking Thorns

Any creature that reaches toward a portrait must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pricked by the thorny brambles. The prick deals no damage, but the portraits change to match the pricked creature and up to four of its closest family members.

#### L12. Textile Mill

Two 3-foot-tall tin soldiers patrol the balcony outside this room, guarding against outside intruders. Each one is a Small suit of [animated armor](/compendium/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md) with 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points. Both doors to this room are closed but not locked. The tin soldiers open the door and enter the room if they hear any commotion within.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Three large, freestanding looms dominate this chamber. A young goblin and a pair of gnome children work the machines, filling the room with a loud, rhythmic clatter. A door is set in the opposite wall, and an archway to the east leads to a storeroom.
^26c

Each night, [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) (see appendix B) visits the textile mill to check up on her workers (see Where's Skabatha? earlier in the chapter). The looms are used to weave fabric for the sewing room and the workshop. They are large, treadle-driven machines that generate a considerable racket. The storeroom contains spools of yarn.

##### Boggles

Three [boggles](/compendium/bestiary/fey/boggle-mpmm.md) (see appendix C) play tricks on the child workers when no one else is around. The boggles are hidden in the corners of the room when the characters arrive, though the children shoot fearful glances at the boggles in the hope that the characters will notice what's going on. A character can use an action to try to spot the hidden boggles, doing so with a successful DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Because of the children's fearful glances, the characters have advantage on this check. The boggles avoid combat, surrendering if they face certain harm.

If Squirt is with the party, it encourages the characters to acquire as much slippery boggle oil as they can (see the "Boggle Oil" sidebar earlier in the chapter). Captured boggles provide the oil freely, hoping to earn their freedom.

##### Children

Three children are working here when the characters arrive: Yevelda (an 8-year-old female goblin), Callybon (an 11-year-old female forest gnome), and her brother, Pogo (a 9-year-old male forest gnome). The children are eager to escape Loomlurch but won't converse with strangers until the area is cleared of boggles.

If the characters ask the children for help navigating the hag's lair, Yevelda reveals that she knows a secret route into Skabatha's bedroom (area L16). To take that route, a character must climb out of the storeroom window, clamber across branches that grow out of the upright trees and pass above area L13, and then hop onto the windowsill of the hag's bedroom. To reach the windowsill, a character must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. On a failed check, the character falls 20 feet onto the roof of area L13, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.

On one of her forays into the hag's private quarters, Yevelda witnessed Pud (see area L8) reporting to the hag. She hasn't told anyone about this yet and is unwilling to share her knowledge about the secret route to area L16 while Pud is present.

##### Treasure

Searching the storeroom reveals the following items of value:

- A gold bodkin (2 gp)
- A pouch holding 35 sp (the coins' mintage is unfamiliar to the characters)
- A small, leather-bound book containing delicate sketches and watercolor paintings of pixies, sprites, and other Fey (50 gp)

#### L13. Granny Nightshade's Kitchen

The door to L14 is ajar, and the doors to areas L11 and L15 are locked. Granny Nightshade carries a key that locks and unlocks all three doors (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter), as does Pincushion (see area L9).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This squalid kitchen is carved out of the trunk of the fallen oak. A large clay oven sits in the middle of the room, surrounded by crowded shelves laden with forest fungi, jars of pickled grubs, animal skulls, and moldy cookbooks. Sickly-sweet vapors emerge from a cauldron that rests atop the oven.
> 
> A young human girl shackled to a worktable is hard at work peeling potatoes. Set into the floor nearby is a padlocked iron grate through which you hear a gruff male voice say, "Are those potatoes I smell?"
^272

Cradlefall, the [green dragon wyrmling](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling.md), spends much of his time dozing in here by the oven. If the characters have not encountered the wyrmling elsewhere, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A green dragon the size of a large dog is coiled up near the oven, apparently dozing. Fumes rise from the wyrmling's nostrils.
^273

Each afternoon, [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) (see appendix B) spends most of her time in this room with occasional visits to the study (area L14). She uses the kitchen to boil candy and prepare potions. The hag treats Cradlefall like her beloved pet; if Skabatha is not present, the wyrmling flees to her side and reports that intruders are in the kitchen.

##### Child Worker

Mishka (a 9-year-old female human) serves Granny Nightshade as a scullery maid. Mishka has managed to escape from Loomlurch twice, only to be tracked down by Cradlefall and recaptured both times; that's why Granny Nightshade now chains her to the worktable. As an action, a character using thieves' tools can pick the lock on Mishka's ankle cuff with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Any key that unlocks the kitchen doors also unlocks Mishka's chains.

If Skabatha isn't present, Mishka tells the characters about the hag's daily routine and describes Granny Nightshade's minions (see Where's Skabatha? and "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter). She suggests that they lure Granny Nightshade into the oven and burn her up.

##### Oven

This oven is large enough to cook a Medium creature whole. A 5-foot-wide iron door in the front of the oven allows one to reach into the oven's interior without disturbing the fuming cauldron that rests atop it. The oven's flames are produced by a [fire elemental](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md) that is bound inside the clay enclosure. Its coal-black eyes are visible inside the flames to anyone who peers inside the oven. While it is trapped in this manner, the elemental can't be targeted or harmed directly.

Any creature that enters the hot oven or starts its turn inside it takes 10 (2d6 + 3) fire damage. A character can try to shove a Medium or smaller creature into the oven, if the creature is within 5 feet of the oven's open door (see ""Shoving a Creature"" in the "Player's Handbook"). If the creature is looking into the oven when it is shoved, the Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to shove the creature is made with advantage.

The oven is a Large object with AC 13, 30 hit points, vulnerability to cold damage, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. If the oven is reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, the elemental escapes from captivity and occupies an open space next to the oven. The elemental waits in the kitchen for Granny Nightshade to appear, then attacks her. It attacks the characters only if they harm it.

##### Trapdoor and Cell

A 3-foot-square, padlocked iron grate covers a 5-foot-deep, 5-foot-wide cell built into the kitchen floor. The walls of the cell are made of 1-foot-thick clay bricks held together with mortar. Granny Nightshade carries the padlock's only key (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter). As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check. As an action, a character can try to pull open the trapdoor without removing the padlock, doing so with a successful DC 22 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

Skabatha imprisons her most hated enemies inside the cell, which is filled with muddy water to a depth of 3 feet. The cell currently holds a bedraggled and grumpy dwarf named [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) (see appendix B), one of the members of the adventuring band known as Valor's Call. If Rubin Sugarwood was lured through the mirror in the Witchlight Carnival's Hall of Illusions, the characters also find him in the cell, still wearing smeared butterfly face paint. Rubin angered the hag, and she has promised to "plant him in her garden" when she has a new plot of ground ready.

If [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) is freed, he provides the following information to his rescuers:

- [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) and his four human companions entered Prismeer to confront their archenemy, the League of Malevolence. [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md)'s companions included [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md) the paladin, [Mercion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mercion-wbtw.md) the cleric, [Molliver](/compendium/bestiary/npc/molliver-wbtw.md) the rogue, and [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) the wizard. Their group is known as Valor's Call.
- The League of Malevolence is a coalition of villains: [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) the sorcerer, [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) the helmed swordsman, [Skylla](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skylla-wbtw.md) the warlock, a priest of Orcus named [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md), and [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) the assassin. Valor's Call caught up with the League of Malevolence in the Palace of Heart's Desire, home of the archfey Zybilna. The two groups fought a mighty battle, during which [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) believes he was knocked out. He woke up here, in Loomlurch.
- Granny Nightshade has lost interest in [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) and is not concerned if he starves to death. The children toss him scraps of food to keep him alive.

[Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) happily joins the characters if he is freed from the cell. He's wearing his armor, and his shield and sword are stuffed in a kitchen cupboard (see "Treasure" below), though he doesn't know that. The old dwarf is determined to free the children of Loomlurch from captivity and ensure their safekeeping until they can be returned to their families. His duty in this regard overpowers even his longing to find out what happened to his adventuring companions; if the children are rescued, [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) rounds them up and cares for them.

When [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) and his friends first arrived in Prismeer, they traveled to the Palace of Heart's Desire by following the stone causeway that once stretched from the palace to the edge of the domain. This route has since been shattered. He knows of no other way to reach the palace.

##### Cauldron

The cauldron is nearly full of hot melted candy, which bubbles gently. As an action, a creature can spill the cauldron's contents onto another creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 (1d4) fire damage; in addition, the creature is covered with a sticky, crunchy candy coating that is easily washed off with water.

##### Cookbooks

Granny Nightshade has several cookbooks in her kitchen that contain candy recipes. One of these books has a 1-foot-long piece of gnarled root as a bookmark; this object is the cutting that Granny Nightshade took from the shambling mound in area L5.

Characters can also find a cookbook that contains formulas for common and uncommon potions. A character can brew such a potion by following the rules for Downtime Activity: Crafting a Magic Item in the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

##### Treasure

Searching Granny Nightshade's kitchen reveals the following treasures:

- Six brass egg cups embossed with the faces of crying children (5 gp each)
- An ornate eight-minute hourglass (75 gp)
- A moldy wooden coffer labeled "Mushrooms" (in Elvish) that contains two butterfly saddles and a hummingbrella (see area L5 for descriptions of these mushrooms)

In addition, [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md)'s [shield](/compendium/items/shield.md) and +1 longsword can be found inside a small cupboard.

#### L14. Study

The door to area L13 is ajar. The staircase in this room climbs 20 feet to area L16.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A staircase runs along the wall of this circular room and climbs to an upper level. Tucked behind curtains of moss and ivy are numerous bookshelves bearing ancient tomes, and built into one of the bookcases is a tall oval mirror in a wooden frame. Flickering candlelight emanates from the eye sockets of a human skull resting on an open rolltop desk.
^27c

[Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) spends part of her day here (see Where's Skabatha? earlier in the chapter); if present, she is seated at the writing desk and scribbling notes to herself while cursing various "unappreciative" child workers under her breath. If [Bavlorna Blightstraw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md) fled Downfall in chapter 2, she is slumped against the wall under the stairs and consumed with self-pity. She's in no mood to fight or have a conversation, so she mumbles and curses to herself, attacking only in self-defense. Both hags' stat blocks appear in appendix B.

The shelves contain books of Feywild lore, all written in Elvish, each of which has a withered frog's body stitched into its spine. Kissing the frog or stroking it with a moistened finger causes the frog to croak the book's title in Elvish. Notable tomes include the following:

_All Things Sticky, Slippery, and Sweet_, written for children, illustrates and describes substances that would fascinate them, such as boggle oil, troll spittle, and various flavors of tree sap.

_Fantasma Demento's Codicil of Conundrums_ is a lavishly illustrated book of fey puzzles and riddles. Answers to the puzzles and riddles are written in invisible ink.

_gobliN eht fo hguaL tsaL_ is a thin, illustrated book describing nilbogs, who are capricious fey spirits that possess goblins, foment chaos in goblinoid society, and use their magic to drive others to do the opposite of what they desire. All the book's writing is backward.

_Pity He's an Elf_ is a collection of illustrated short stories about an elf adventurer named Aethyn Ourglas, who travels the Feywild and befriends dangerous creatures in surprising ways.

_The Queen's Gowns_ depicts and describes famous gowns worn by the Summer Queen, with asides written by the gowns' equally famous designers.

_Tales from the Gloaming Court_ is a set of eleven hefty, green-covered, illustrated books filled with stories and illustrations of Feywild intrigue that shed light on the Seelie and Unseelie courts. (Volumes 3 and 8 are missing from Skabatha's collection and can be found in chapter 4.)

_Three Rules to Rule By_ is a thin, dog-eared book that describes the rules of hospitality, ownership, and reciprocity in detail (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2).

_Twilight Tides_ is a fat, wrinkled book about navigating the oceans of the Feywild.

After two books were stolen from her collection (volumes 3 and 8 of _Tales from the Gloaming Court_), Skabatha placed wards on every one of the remaining books. Any book that is removed from her study turns to ashes instantly. A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each book.

Shelved among the books are hundreds of scrolls that bear no magical wards; they describe encounters with individuals who struck bargains with Skabatha, and the horrible curses she put on each of them for failing to uphold their end.

##### Magic Mirror

The oval mirror built into one of the bookcases functions like the magic mirror in area B1 of Bavlorna's cottage (see chapter 2).

##### Rolltop Desk

This desk contains quills, ink, a human skull fashioned into a lantern, a treasure (see "Treasure" below), and a rolled-up wanted poster bearing a sketch of Will of the Feywild, along with the following text in Common:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> _Wanted: Will of the Feywild_!
> 
> _Find this flibbertigibbet and deliver him to me alive and unharmed, and I shall make you as strong as an octopus!_
> 
> _Granny Nightshade_
^280

Any character who can rightfully claim this reward is better off not doing so, for it comes in the form of a potion that, if drunk, gives the imbiber a Strength score of 4 (the strength of a normal [octopus](/compendium/bestiary/beast/octopus.md)). The effect lasts until the creature receives the benefit of a [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, a [greater restoration](/compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell, or similar magic.

##### Treasure

Among the junk in the rolltop desk are the following interesting items:

- A varnished human eyeball inside the lower half of a small hourglass that hangs like a pendant from a necklace made of woven hair. This is the Hourglass Coven's _hag eye_ (described in the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the "Monster Manual").
- A black-feathered quill with a bone tip that magically produces its own ink (150 gp). The ink is the crimson color of fresh blood until it dries, whereupon its color changes to sepia.
- A Tiny clockwork toad with AC 5 and 1 hit point. If a creature places the toad on the ground, it hops 5 feet across the ground on each of the creature's turns in a random direction and makes a croaking noise that can be heard out to a range of 30 feet. Any creature that licks the clockwork toad must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. While the creature is [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, other creatures are [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) to it.

#### L15. Redcap Patch

> [!quote] ...
> 
> To one side of the giant, toppled tree is a grove of bearded willows on the bank of a murky woodland pond. A patch of tilled earth spreads beneath their boughs. The caps of several red toadstools are just beginning to emerge from the loam.
^283

The toadstools are the tips of the hats worn by six [redcaps](/compendium/bestiary/fey/redcap-mpmm.md) (see appendix C) that are forming under the earth. Any creature that tries to pick a toadstool causes its redcap to rise up out of the earth, outraged at being awakened early. This redcap is not fully formed and has half its normal hit points.

Whenever Granny Nightshade's key stops turning, 1d3 redcaps emerge fully grown from this patch, leaving any remaining redcaps under the soil, still not fully formed. The risen redcaps loiter here until they see something they can kill or until Granny Nightshade gives them a mission.

The redcaps are hostile toward creatures other than Granny Nightshade. However, if a redcap is offered a gift, it accepts the gift and becomes so angry at the thought of having to reciprocate (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2) that it clutches its chest and keels over dead at the start of its next turn.

#### L16. Granny Nightshade's Bedroom

This room has two closed doors, one leading to a 20-foot-high balcony and the other leading to area L17. Neither door is locked. A staircase descends to area L14.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Almost everything about this bedroom is orderly, from the bed with the patchwork quilt to the ornamental pigs arranged in a neat row on the dresser. Such tidiness is at odds, however, with the decaying dollhouse sitting on the bedside table. This three-foot-tall edifice has seen better days and is now besmirched by peeling paint, mold, and rot.
> 
> Behind the dollhouse, by the window, moths flutter inside a large bell jar. Facing one another along the outer wall are a pair of doors. Next to the door closest to the staircase is a wooden rocking cradle with a neatly folded blanket in it.
^285

If [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) (see appendix B) is here, she is asleep inside the dollhouse in her miniaturized form. While Granny Nightshade is sleeping, a character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to sneak up on her without waking her. Talking near the dollhouse also awakens her.

The dollhouse is fully enclosed, rather than being open at the back as a normal dollhouse would be. A Tiny creature can enter the dollhouse through its front door or one of its windows and explore its interior, which has a gloomy foyer, parlor, kitchen, and dining room on the ground floor; two bedrooms, a sewing room, and a nonfunctional bath on the second floor; and a spooky, spacious attic. If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook and Granny Nightshade stole from the characters, any items that their lost things were transformed into are kept inside the dollhouse's attic, along with the items listed in the "Treasure" section below.

Characters who inspect the outside of the dollhouse closely can see that the roof is hinged, like the lid of a toybox. It is held shut by an [arcane lock](/compendium/spells/arcane-lock.md) spell that only Granny Nightshade can bypass without using magic. No amount of brute force will open the sealed roof, but a [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic opens it, granting access to the attic and its contents. Granny Nightshade also set a password ("rumpleclump") that, when spoken within 5 feet of the dollhouse, suppresses the [arcane lock](/compendium/spells/arcane-lock.md) spell for 1 minute. Cradlefall and Pincushion know the password but won't divulge it unless their very existence is threatened. Mishka (see area L13) also knows the password and shares it with any characters who are willing to help her.

Creatures inside the dollhouse can't be affected by spells or attacks that originate outside the dollhouse, and the dollhouse is enchanted to be immune to all damage. If it is knocked over, each creature inside the dollhouse must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage from colliding with walls, furniture, and junk.

##### Jar of Moths

Granny Nightshade keeps these moths to ameliorate the effect of her curse: after she wakes each morning, she forgets all about the first creature she sees. This means that Granny Nightshade doesn't think about the creature, doesn't see it in front of her, and instantly forgets anything it says. The effect lasts until she finishes her next long rest or until she takes damage from the creature, at which point she remembers everything. So, to lessen the risk to herself, Granny Nightshade placed the jar of moths where it would be the first thing she sees when she emerges from her dollhouse each morning.

##### Rocking Cradle

This cradle is painted with images of green dragons. It belongs to Cradlefall, though the wyrmling has outgrown it. It contains a folded, threadbare blanket.

##### Treasure

The attic of the dollhouse contains the following valuable items:

- A pair of embroidered velvet slippers (15 gp)
- A false eye made of solid gold (25 gp)
- A cracked hand mirror with a gaudy, bejeweled handle and frame (65 gp)

#### L17. Aviary

The door to area L16 is closed but not locked.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Old, empty birdhouses are nailed to the walls of this cramped room, and a dozen birdcages hang from the ceiling. The cages are filled with tiny clockwork sparrows. As the birds' gears turn, the air thrums with rhythmic ticking. Paper and quills are heaped on a small writing desk under the cages. A pair of open windows overlook the forest beyond. Carved into the wall above one window is the word "Hither," and above the other is the word "Yon."

Granny Nightshade uses the mechanical sparrows to relay messages to her sisters. The sparrows use the [hawk](/compendium/bestiary/beast/hawk.md) stat block but are Constructs that are immune to poison and psychic damage; the effects of exhaustion; and the [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified), and [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) conditions.

The sparrows have their names engraved on their breasts. (Example names include Glyff, Pim, and Zwee. Create others as needed.) If a creature speaks a sparrow's name aloud and gives it a task, it flies off as though affected by an [animal messenger](/compendium/spells/animal-messenger.md) spell. In addition to delivering spoken messages, a mechanical sparrow can also carry written letters.

##### Writing Desk

The writing desk contains three letters, two from Bavlorna and one from Endelyn:

No matter what Endelyn says, that burbling beast of a dragon is a threat to our coven and our three realms. How Zybilna managed to befriend it, I'll never know! Maybe we should ask her—ha ha.Much love_,

> 
> _If worse comes to worst, recall that Elidon's mate still dwells in your forest. You could kill Lamorna and take her horn—assuming, of course, you're not too busy making toys_.

> _There's no use asking Endelyn if she has the horn. She doesn't tell us anything! But if we don't find it soon, I fear what the jabberwock will do after it gets tired of prowling the forest and turns its fiery gaze elsewhere. Gods' bodkins, that thing gives me nightmares_!
> 
> _Must I remind you that we need a unicorn's horn to free creatures from the cauldron's time-freezing magic? It's not enough to know their true names, you know. Of course, my greater concern is that someone else finds the horn and uses it for exactly that purpose. What do you think Zybilna will do to us, we treacherous three, if she's no longer bound by her cauldron's magic_?

> _Your beloved sister_,

### From Thither to Yon

At any time, Squirt can lead the characters through the mists of Prismeer to the mountains of Yon. If the characters have not yet encountered Squirt, steer them to Little Oak or have the treant come to them. If Squirt was lost or destroyed, choose another creature to serve as their guide to Yon. Little Oak would be a fine choice.
