# Palace of Heart's Desire
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, p. 171* 

The archfey Zybilna is known to grant wishes to mortals brave enough to visit her abode: the Palace of Heart's Desire.

Zybilna's fairytale palace sits at the heart of Prismeer. On some worlds, the archfey is seen as a fairy godmother of sorts, casting [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spells for the benefit of the lost, the forsaken, or the betrayed. Sometimes her wishes would bring happiness, other times despair. Her palace was a destination for anyone seeking their heart's desire.

Zybilna no longer grants wishes, for she is trapped in temporal stasis—frozen in time by the magic of her cauldron, which the hags of the Hourglass Coven have turned against her. Freeing Zybilna is the only way to repair the damage the hags have done to Prismeer, but doing so carries certain risks, for Zybilna has a dark side that she has hidden away for many years.

## Running This Chapter

In this chapter, the characters explore the halls of Lavoglia, better known as the Palace of Heart's Desire. Most likely, they've learned of Zybilna's betrayal at the hands of the Hourglass Coven and are searching for a way to free her. The characters can undo the spell that froze Zybilna in time and learn that she is, in fact, [Iggwilv the Witch Queen](/compendium/bestiary/npc/iggwilv-the-witch-queen-wbtw.md). If all goes well, they can free Zybilna and count on her help in return—perhaps even gaining a [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell for their trouble.

Before your first game session in this chapter, follow these steps to help make the players' experience as entertaining as possible:

- Read the description of [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) in appendix A.
- Read this chapter in its entirety, and reacquaint yourself with the "Rules of Conduct" and "Death in Prismeer" sections of chapter 2.
- Check the Story Tracker for any achievements that could help the characters inside the palace.

### Fall of the Witch Queen

[Iggwilv the Witch Queen](/compendium/bestiary/npc/iggwilv-the-witch-queen-wbtw.md) created the persona of Zybilna to hide from her most hated enemies. In the Feywild, she raised a magnificent palace and set about establishing herself as the benevolent archfey Zybilna of Prismeer, avatar of mercy for destitute mortals. Her closest allies saw the cracks in her facade, flashes of arrogance and cruelty that conflicted with her kindly persona, but they ascribed this behavior to the mercurial nature of archfey.

Over time, Iggwilv made the mistake of placing too much trust in the hags of the Hourglass Coven, who served in her court as advisors. The hags waited patiently for the opportunity to overthrow Iggwilv. That day came when the League of Malevolence arrived at the palace.

For years, the evil sorcerer [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) had coveted the [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md) wielded by his archenemy, a good-aligned wizard named [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md). When [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) uncovered clues to Zybilna's true identity, he hatched a foolish plan to blackmail her into bringing him the staff. [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) was betrayed at the eleventh hour by his own companion, the warlock [Skylla](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skylla-wbtw.md), who secretly swore loyalty to Baba Yaga, Iggwilv's adoptive mother. When the League of Malevolence arrived at the palace, the Hourglass Coven ensured that [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md)'s rivals from Valor's Call were close behind. The two factions clashed inside the palace.

> Iggwilv has a long and storied history throughout the multiverse. This adventure presents the legendary figure in her current form. Her [stat block](/compendium/bestiary/npc/iggwilv-the-witch-queen-wbtw.md) appears at the end of the chapter.
> 
> **Baba Yaga's Daughter.** Iggwilv's path to greatness began when she was adopted by the mother of all witches, Baba Yaga, who named her Natasha. On the worlds of the Material Plane, she was better known as Tasha, the inventor of [Tasha's hideous laughter](/compendium/spells/tashas-hideous-laughter.md). Tasha's magic-fueled ambitions brought her into contact with demons and demon lords, which she subjugated and used against her enemies. Tasha became known on the world of Oerth as [Iggwilv the Witch Queen](/compendium/bestiary/npc/iggwilv-the-witch-queen-wbtw.md), a peerless wizard and conqueror. It was she who wrote the [Demonomicon of Iggwilv](/compendium/items/demonomicon-of-iggwilv-tce.md)—the greatest of all treatises on the Abyss and its demonic inhabitants. (The book, which plays no part in this adventure, is described in "Tasha's Cauldron of Everything".)
> 
> **Iggwilv's Transformation.** Iggwilv learned several dark secrets while studying the Abyss, including the ability to summon demons and demonic spirits. But in her quest for absolute power, she made too many enemies and underestimated their determination to destroy her, so she fled to other worlds and across planes to escape the worst of them. She eventually took a page from her mother's book and sequestered herself in the Feywild, where she assumed the guise of an archfey and carved out a spectacular domain for herself. Gradually, Iggwilv transformed into a Fey creature, though she outwardly appears human. Her disposition changed over time as well, as she became less interested in personal power and more interested in exploring her fey existence.
^iggwilv-the-witch-queen

While Zybilna was distracted, the hags used [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) to freeze everyone but themselves in temporal stasis.

Unable to agree on who should keep the cauldron, the three hags freed the members of the League of Malevolence from temporal stasis by touching each of them with a unicorn horn, then hired them to watch over the cauldron. Not long afterward, the unicorn horn was lost.

### The League of Malevolence

The League of Malevolence is led by a human sorcerer named [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md), who intends to free [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) from temporal stasis and claim the wizard's [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md). To this end, he and the other members of the league are searching Prismeer for a unicorn horn to break the spell on [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md). See appendix B for more information on these villains.

When the characters arrive at the palace, the following members of the League of Malevolence are present:

- [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) holds court in the throne room (area P31), where he is protected by a helmed swordsman named [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md).
- [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md), a human priest of Orcus who hopes to supplant [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) as leader of the league, is usually encountered in area P30.

Two other members of the League of Malevolence can be found elsewhere in Prismeer:

- [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md), an assassin, was sent to Thither to slay a unicorn named Lamorna and acquire her horn (see "Wayward Pool" in chapter 3).
- [Skylla](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skylla-wbtw.md), the warlock who forged a secret pact with Baba Yaga, has sequestered herself in Motherhorn, where she has adopted the stage name of Charmay (see area M12 in chapter 4).

> [!quote] Where Shall We Three Meet Again?
> 
> If the characters forced the hags of the Hourglass Coven to flee their lairs in chapters 2, 3, and 4, the hags retreat to area P47. When the hags are in the palace, members of the League of Malevolence act as their underlings while steering clear of the hags whenever possible.
^where-shall-we-three-meet-again

### Valor's Call

Led by the human paladin [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md), the heroes of Valor's Call tracked the League of Malevolence to Prismeer. Determined to bring the league's members to justice for crimes committed on many worlds, Valor's Call met with Zybilna and tried to forge an alliance with the archfey. When the hags of the Hourglass Coven used [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) to freeze Zybilna in time, several members of Valor's Call were frozen in time as well:

- [Mercion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mercion-wbtw.md), a human cleric, was frozen in the ballroom (area P22) alongside Zybilna. [Mercion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mercion-wbtw.md) was in sight of the cauldron, so she witnessed the Hourglass Coven's betrayal.
- [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md), a human wizard, was frozen in area P23 while casting a [cone of cold](/compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md) spell.
- [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md) was frozen just as [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) blasted him through the wall of Zybilna's study (area P47). He now hovers in the air above the Court of Storms (area P13).

Two more members of Valor's Call are found elsewhere in Prismeer:

- [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md), a dwarf fighter, was released from temporal stasis so that [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md) could interrogate him. The characters encounter [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) in Thither (see area L13 in chapter 3).
- [Molliver](/compendium/bestiary/npc/molliver-wbtw.md), a human rogue, was not in the palace when the time-freezing effect took hold. The characters encounter [Molliver](/compendium/bestiary/npc/molliver-wbtw.md) in Yon (see "Brigganock Mine" in chapter 4).

See appendix B for more information on these heroes.

## Arrival at the Palace

The means by which the characters travel to the palace determines where they arrive:

- Characters who make the overland journey from Yon with Amidor cross a bridge that leads straight to the palace's front gate (area P1).
- Characters who ride on the backs of giant cranes from Motherhorn are deposited in the garden (area P2).

No matter how the characters arrive at the palace, describe it as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A twilit palace emerges dreamlike from the clouds. A great marble tower ringed by delicate spires casts its shadow over the rooftops below. Another tower teeters nearby, torn from its foundations and held aloft by a coiled beanstalk. Monstrous vines cling to the palace walls and choke the promontory of rock on which it perches.
^35f

From the palace, the characters can gaze across the whole of Prismeer. You can now show your players the poster map of the domain. Once the characters view Prismeer from the palace, they can travel between Hither, Thither, or Yon without guides and can find their way to any location marked on the poster map.

As the characters survey their surroundings, the [jabberwock](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/jabberwock-wbtw.md) (see appendix C) returns from a hunt in Thither:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Hundreds of birds burst from the canopy of the ancient forest below you and scatter in all directions. Moments later, a much more fearsome creature erupts from the woods: a sinewy, pale-green dragon that takes to the sky and flies toward the palace. Its mighty wings carry it to great heights. Once above the palace, it drops like a stone and vanishes from sight behind the palace's high walls.
^360

The jabberwock has fed and is tired. It returns to its lair in the ballroom (area P22), entering the palace through a hole in the wall of the bathing room (area P25) and ignoring the characters.

### Friends and Followers

In their travels through Hither, Thither, and Yon, the characters might have gained a follower or three. Likely companions include the three guides ([Clapperclaw the scarecrow](/compendium/bestiary/npc/clapperclaw-the-scarecrow-wbtw.md), [Squirt the oilcan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/squirt-the-oilcan-wbtw.md), and [Amidor the dandelion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/amidor-the-dandelion-wbtw.md)), but others are possible. Running this chapter will be much easier if you encourage the player characters to explore the palace on their own, leaving any friends and followers outside the front gate or in the palace garden. These friends and followers, justifiably afraid that the palace will make mincemeat out of them, encourage the characters to explore the palace without them.

By the time the characters reach the palace, they might have learned one or more of the following facts, which you can gently reiterate to discourage the characters from allowing others to follow them into the palace:

- Zybilna's dragon (the jabberwock) haunts the palace. Only the bravest and hardiest adventurers stand a chance of surviving an encounter with it.
- There are likely to be magical wards throughout the palace—some placed by Zybilna, others by the Hourglass Coven.
- The League of Malevolence occupies the palace, and three of its members are still unaccounted for.

Two members of Valor's Call are noteworthy exceptions. If [Elkhorn](/compendium/bestiary/npc/elkhorn-wbtw.md) and [Molliver](/compendium/bestiary/npc/molliver-wbtw.md) are with the party, they insist on accompanying the characters into the palace to make sure the other members of Valor's Call are all right.

## Exploring the Palace

The palace has more than a few recurring physical features, not the least of which are creatures and objects frozen in time by the Hourglass Coven and [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md).

### Palace Features

The sky above the palace is always filled with the orange and purple hues of twilight. The walls, ceilings, and floors inside the palace are made of dressed marble unless the text states otherwise. The ceilings throughout the palace are 30 feet high and arched. Climbing gear or magic is needed to scale the palace walls, inside or out.

Magical wards on all the windows and many of the doors render them immune to all damage and their locks impossible to pick, although a [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic opens a locked window or door. Assume a door is unlocked and a window is locked unless the text states otherwise.

#### Crown Locks

Most of the locked doors in the palace can be unlocked by placing the crown from the maiden's pond (area P8) on the head of either the iron lion in area P9 or the iron hart in area P10. It is assumed that the characters will revisit areas P9 and P10 from time to time so that they can toggle the locks to provide entry where they want to go. Once opened, a crown-locked door can be propped open to keep it from locking again when the crown is removed from the head of the lion or the hart. A crown-locked door can also be opened with a [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell.

The maps of the palace use the following symbols to denote these locked doors:

This symbol denotes a lion crown lock, which can be unlocked by placing the crown on the head of the iron lion in area P9.

This symbol denotes a hart crown lock, which can be unlocked by placing the crown on the head of the iron hart in area P10.

A marble cameo depicting a lion or a hart wearing a crown is mounted above each magically locked door, identifying which iron guardian must wear the crown for it to be unlocked.

Creatures whose names have been penned inside Zybilna's ritual book (see area P49) can open locked doors in the palace without using the crown. This is how the members of the Hourglass Coven and the League of Malevolence are able to move through the palace unhindered.

### Temporal Stasis

Many creatures and objects throughout the palace are trapped in temporal stasis—frozen in time, in other words.

Creatures in temporal stasis, as well as anything they are carrying or wearing, can't be harmed or moved until the magic on them is ended. Various unattended objects, magical effects, and other natural phenomena throughout the palace are also frozen in time; for example, motes of dust hang motionless in the air, flames stand perfectly still, and food remains unspoiled.

#### Ending the Effect on Creatures

One can use an action to end the time-freezing magic on a creature by touching it with a unicorn horn while speaking the creature's true name. (Nicknames and aliases won't work.) Zybilna's faithful butler, [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) (see area P15), learned this fact after spying on the hags, and he shares this knowledge with characters who befriend him.

#### Unattended Objects Frozen in Time

A unicorn horn has no effect on objects frozen in time that aren't being worn or carried. Unlike creatures in temporal stasis, unattended objects that are frozen in time can be manipulated, moved, damaged, and destroyed; a time-frozen apple is just as juicy as it was before being frozen, and time-frozen fire still deals damage and can be snuffed out by pouring water over it.

### Lower Palace Locations

The following locations are keyed to the maps of the palace. If the characters explore one or more of these locations after ending the time-freezing effect on the palace, modify the descriptions of these locations as needed to account for this change.

#### P1. Front Gate

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Ivy clings to a set of silvery gates embedded in the palace's outer wall. A luxuriant garden can be seen beyond the bars of the gates.
^36a

The double gate is 20 feet tall and pushes open with ease. Its silver-plated iron bars are spaced wide enough for Small humanoids to squeeze through. The wall encircling the garden is 40 feet high and is easily climbed due to the vegetation clinging to it.

##### Concealed Inscription

Characters who search the gate for traps don't find any, but they do notice a small bronze plaque embedded in a flagstone at the base of the gate. The plaque bears an inscription in Elvish that provides a hint about unlocking the crown locks inside the palace (see "Crown Locks" above). The inscription reads:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> _The lion or the hart must wear the crown._
> 
> _But which one should it weigh down?_
^36c

#### P2. Palace Garden

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The scents of roses, cowslips, and hyacinths suffuse this vast garden. Ahead, a ring of standing stones rises from the flower beds. Glittering streams divide the garden and connect with a large pond shaded by willows. The garden is silent save for the sounds of music and voices coming from a colorful pavilion by the front gate.
^36e

This garden encompasses several other locations (areas P3 through P8) and is lush with flower beds, trees, and topiaries. The streams are 2 feet deep and easily forded.

Minor damage to the garden is tolerated, but widespread destruction causes the iron lion in area P9 and the iron hart in area P10 to burst out of their towers and attack those responsible.

##### Frozen Features

Characters who explore the garden notice that its features and most of its occupants (except for some of the guests in the pavilion and the ettercaps in the rose garden) are frozen in time. Pixies are suspended in midflight or frozen mid-frolic in the stream, the waters of which are perfectly still. Forest gnome gardeners stand rigidly in flower beds, time-frozen water issuing from their tipped wooden watering cans, or atop small ladders, taking shears to topiaries in need of trimming. Bees and pollen hang motionless in the air.

##### Fruit Trees

Many of the trees in the garden bear glittering gold and silver fruit. A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals auras of divination magic around the gold fruit and auras of abjuration magic around the silver fruit.

A creature that eats more than half of a gold-skinned fruit gains advantage on Wisdom saving throws for 24 hours, but this benefit ends on the creature if it eats a silver-skinned fruit. A creature that eats more than half of a silver-skinned fruit gains 10 temporary hit points, which go away if the creature eats a gold-skinned fruit. Once it is plucked from the branch, a golden or silver fruit spoils after 10 minutes and loses its magical property.

##### Streams

Two streams flow into the pool at area P8—or, rather, they used to flow before they were frozen in time. The streams emerge from culverts in the garden walls, but where the water comes from is anyone's guess. (It is created magically and disappears magically before it can cause the pool to overflow.) The time-frozen water, which has the consistency of soft dough, takes on the qualities of normal water if removed from either stream or the pool.

#### P3. Pavilion

The entrance to the pavilion is open, and music and voices come from inside the place. If one or more characters look inside, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Seven guests—one of them a talking bear—lounge around a picnic table covered with an emerald-green cloth and laden with cakes, teapots, teacups, and cutlery. Two of the guests are motionless and silent, but the others are engaged in spirited conversation. At the back of the pavilion, a string quartet of badger minstrels plays delicate chamber music.
^373

The guests gathered here are denizens of the Material Plane who regard Zybilna as a fairy godmother-like figure. After using various fey crossings to enter the Feywild, they petitioned spellcasters to transport them to the palace, arriving in the ring of standing stones (area P4). They had hoped to receive audiences with Zybilna upon their arrival but have been told to wait in the garden until meetings can be arranged with her representatives (the sisters of the Hourglass Coven). The guests are unaware of Zybilna's current predicament and have lost track of time.

The guests include these individuals:

- Sumai, a farmer (lawful good, male, human [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) from the world of Toril, carries a carnivorous pumpkin named Yamzu (an [awakened shrub](/compendium/bestiary/plant/awakened-shrub.md) that speaks Common, with a Bite attack identical to the shrub's Rake attack except it deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage). Sumai wants Yamzu to stop devouring his livestock, but he doesn't want to harm the pumpkin.
- Lord Eld, a faultlessly polite aristocrat (chaotic good, male, high elf [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) from the world of Oerth, was transformed into a living statue by wild magic emanating from a family crypt. He wants the effect to be undone and to be restored to his true form. While in this form, he has resistance to all damage, but his speed is halved.
- Obal Obb, a headless dwarf (lawful good, male, mountain dwarf [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) hailing from the world of Oerth, is searching for his missing head, which was stolen. The magic that deprived Obal of his head left him [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) but, miraculously, he can hear just fine. He stomps his foot once to communicate "yes," and twice for "no."
- Bodger, a [brown bear](/compendium/bestiary/beast/brown-bear.md) from a world of your choice, hopes to undo a curse put on him by a cruel river spirit who resented him eating its fish. Thanks to the [awaken](/compendium/spells/awaken.md) spell that was cast on him by a friendly druid, Bodger has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common.
- Majera d'Valzey (neutral, female, human [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) from the world of Eberron, has a magic quill named Dictado. The quill scrawls out anything Majera says, and her place at the table is piled with sheets of parchment. Majera is hoping to break the terms of an arranged marriage.

Two other guests were present when the Hourglass Coven froze the palace in time: Hogus Pinsworth (lawful good, male, strongheart halfling [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) from the world of Tal'dorei, who needs help paying off his debts, and Zurrash (chaotic good, female [orc war chief](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc-war-chief.md)) from the world of Eberron, who was ousted by one of her rivals. Both are trapped in temporal stasis, and none of the other pavilion guests know who they are.

When the characters arrive, the five guests who aren't frozen in time are having an animated conversation about whether clotted cream should be applied to a scone before or after jam. They are so engrossed in this debate that they fail to acknowledge the presence of newcomers unless a character enters the discussion or taps on a teacup loudly with a spoon (which the guests sometimes do when seeking attention).

If questioned, the guests reveal that they arrived at the palace separately and each of them is waiting to speak to one or more of Zybilna's representatives. They've been here a long time (how long they aren't sure exactly), yet they remain patient and well fed. The guests have wandered the garden but can offer no information about the palace. They know better than to enter the palace without an invitation.

##### Badger Minstrels

Each of these four [badgers](/compendium/bestiary/beast/badger.md) received one of [Skabatha Nightshade](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skabatha-nightshade-wbtw.md)'s [awaken](/compendium/spells/awaken.md) spells, which granted it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common. [Bavlorna Blightstraw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bavlorna-blightstraw-wbtw.md) crafted instruments for the badgers, and [Endelyn Moongrave](/compendium/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md) taught them how to play their instruments. They now have proficiency in the [Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance) skill.

The hags have instructed the badgers to entertain visitors and discourage them from entering the palace until the Hourglass Coven gets around to striking bargains with them. The badgers proudly declare their allegiance to the hags, saying, "What fine ladies they are. Their names should be Sweetness, Kindness, and Charity, for all the good they do!" (The badgers aren't evil, just misguided.)

##### Tea and Cakes

The pavilion's supply of tea and cakes magically replenishes every hour. The cakes are delicious. Any cakes removed from the pavilion instantly become moldy.

##### Treasure

Characters who freed [Sir Talavar](/compendium/bestiary/npc/sir-talavar-wbtw.md) in chapter 2 find a wrapped present on the table, with their names written on the tag. None of the guests has been rude enough to open it. Inside, the characters find a [chime of opening](/compendium/items/chime-of-opening.md), along with a note that reads in Draconic, "Many thanks! May fortune smile on you. Yours, [Sir Talavar](/compendium/bestiary/npc/sir-talavar-wbtw.md)."

#### P4. Standing Stones

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Twelve moss-covered standing stones form a ring in the middle of a small clearing. An arcane sigil is inscribed on the inward-facing side of each stone, and the space between the stones is free of vegetation.
^378

A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the standing stones. Any character who examines the sigils on the stones and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can determine that they combine into a sequence that allows the ring of standing stones to function as a teleportation circle. A character who has this sequence written down or committed to memory can use it in conjunction with the [teleportation circle](/compendium/spells/teleportation-circle.md) spell to arrive inside the ring, provided the spell is cast somewhere in the Feywild.

#### P5. Fountain of Awakening

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A marble fountain rises from a plinth on the bank of the stream, overflowing with time-frozen water that spills from the mouths of sculpted animals. The frozen spray surrounding the fountain creates rainbows in the air around it.
^37a

A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the fountain. The magic of this fountain still functions even though its waters are frozen in time. The water can be handled and made to hold new forms as if it were soft dough, but any water removed from the fountain takes on the consistency of normal water. Any Beast that bathes in the fountain's still waters is awakened, as if by the [awaken](/compendium/spells/awaken.md) spell, provided it meets the spell's requirements. The effect ends if the awakened Beast leaves the palace garden.

Any Humanoid that drinks from the fountain or bathes in its waters must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, its Intelligence score drops to 3 for 24 hours, and it gains the following flaw, which supersedes any conflicting trait: "I have the disposition of a wild animal." Any magic that ends a curse ends the effect on the creature immediately.

#### P6. Woodcutter's Axe

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A gleaming greataxe is embedded in a withered tree stump near a bend in the stream.
^37c

##### Treasure

The greataxe is a [woodcutter's axe](/compendium/items/woodcutters-axe-wbtw.md) (see appendix A). Only a creature that has a Strength score of 18 or higher can remove it from the stump.

#### P7. Rose Garden

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This fragrant rose garden is bordered by a bronze fence. The roses come in a variety of colors, with a few white and black specimens among them. Glistening spiderwebs cover the rosebushes.
^37f

The webs belong to three [ettercaps](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/ettercap.md) that recently crawled up from the forest of Thither. They lurk under the soil, waiting patiently for tasty fairies to get stuck in their webs. If one or more characters enter the rose garden, the ettercaps rise from their earthy cysts and assume threatening postures, hoping to scare off the characters. The ettercaps lack the courage to fight anything bigger than a pixie, but they defend themselves if attacked. An ettercap reduced to 22 hit points or fewer tries to flee by crawling up and over the nearby palace wall.

##### Chromatic Roses

Any character who explores the rose garden spots a magic rosebush growing near its center:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> In the heart of the rose garden, coiled around a statue of a prancing satyr holding a set of pipes to his lips, is a thorny vine with five roses growing out of it, each one a different color: black, blue, green, red, and white.
^381

The vine has five chromatic roses (see appendix A). If all five roses are picked, the vine withers and dies.

##### Statue

The statue is a [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) [satyr](/compendium/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) named Xinipax. If the [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition is ended on him, Xinipax plays a whimsical tune on his pipes and offers his rescuers a gift in return. He gallops to the nearby stream, pulls a wineskin from its shallow depths, guzzles down its contents, and hands the empty wineskin to his rescuers. Xinipax believes the wineskin can turn water into the finest elven wine, but he is mistaken. The satyr is cursed with the inability to tell water from wine, and the wineskin is nonmagical. Even if his claim is proven false, Xinipax still regards the wineskin as a worthy gift.

Xinipax doesn't know what turned him to stone or how long he was [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified). After bestowing his gift, he gallops around the garden, playing his pipes and making a general nuisance of himself. He has no useful information about the palace or its other inhabitants.

#### P8. Maiden's Pond

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Willow trees encircle this sheltered pond. Lily pads dot the mirror-like surface of the water, and hungry dragonflies dart about, feeding on motionless fireflies that form an unmoving cloud above the still water.
^384

The lake, the trees, and the fireflies are frozen in time, but the dragonflies are not. The pool's time-frozen water can be handled and made to hold new forms as if it were soft dough, but any water removed from the pool takes on the consistency of normal water.

If one or more characters touch the pool, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A delicate hand made of water, black as winter's night, silently breaks the water's surface. The hand clutches a crown made of silver needles. Below the hand, under the surface, a school of shimmering black fish takes on a vaguely humanoid form.
^385

A fey spirit is bound to the lake. Underwater, its body has the shape of a school of fish. Its watery hand holds the crown aloft until a character takes it or the party moves away, at which point the hand slips back under the water. If the crown isn't taken from the hand, it can be retrieved from the bottom of the lake, which is 10 feet deep.

##### Taking the Crown

Its sharp needles make the crown difficult to handle without gloves or gauntlets. The pricking of the needles isn't severe enough to deal damage, but a character can't grasp the crown with bare hands for longer than 1 minute before the discomfort becomes unbearable.

A character who holds the crown hears a gentle voice on the wind. In a language the character understands, the voice says:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> _The beginning of Whenever_
> 
> _The end of Ever After_
> 
> _The start of an Age_
> 
> _The finale of every Moment_
> 
> _The first in History_
^387

Arranging the indicated letters of the key words on each line in sequence spells out the word "Wrath" (for example, the first letter of "Whenever" is W, the last letter of "Ever" and "After" is R, and so forth). The riddle hints that the crown should first be placed on the brow of Wrath, the iron hart (see area P10).

#### P9. Envy's Tower

The base of this tower is 10 feet higher than the garden floor. Stairs hugging the tower's outer wall climb 10 feet to an unlocked double door. A bronze plaque above the door reads "[Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md)" in Common. The tower is 30 feet tall and has no roof, enabling characters to enter it from above if they have the means to do so.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Oak trees fill much of the interior of this tower. Rays of light cut through the canopy, illuminating a marble pedestal that stands at ground level, swathed in tree roots. A hulking lion seemingly made of iron stands on the pedestal, flicking its tail in irritation. "You can call us [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md)," it says.
^389

The iron lion, [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md), is one of two guardians that Zybilna created to watch over her garden in her absence. When Zybilna became frozen in time, her guardians appeared from their respective demiplanes to perform their duty. [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) uses the [gorgon](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/gorgon.md) stat block, with these changes:

- The iron lion speaks Common and Sylvan, referring to itself using the pronouns "we" and "us."
- It has a Bite attack instead of a Gore attack, and it has a Claws attack that deals slashing damage instead of a Hooves attack that deals bludgeoning damage. (The attacks are functionally the same otherwise.)

[Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) dislikes its counterpart, Wrath (see area P10), but the two are prevented by Zybilna's magic from harming one another. When the characters first grace the iron lion with their presence, it demands their obeisance and commands them to kneel before it. If the characters do as [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) commands, the lion is pleased and allows them to remain in its presence. Characters who fail to show it deference are instructed to leave the tower at once, and the lion attacks those who refuse.

The lion shares the following information with characters who show it proper respect:

- "We and our counterpart were created as a pair to protect the gardens from intruders in Zybilna's absence."
- "Our presence here means that our mistress is gone. Where? We do not know."
- "The palace receives visitors even in Zybilna's absence. Guests are to remain in the garden pavilion until Zybilna deigns to grant them an audience. It is not our responsibility to protect visitors."

Characters on good terms with [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) can ask it about the crown of needles from area P8. It knows the following information about the crown:

- "Zybilna created the crown as a key that guests can use to reach certain areas of the palace in her absence. The crown has two forms: one made of silver needles, the other of golden roses."
- "To transform the crown of needles into its gold form, it must be placed on the brow of the correct iron guardian. Which of us, [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) or Wrath, is the correct guardian? We cannot say. Placing the crown on the incorrect guardian banishes the guardian to its demiplane, along with the crown."
- "Once the crown is transformed into its gold form, either guardian can wear it without being banished. Certain doors inside the palace become unlocked or locked, depending on which guardian wears the golden crown." (Neither [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) nor Wrath knows which doors in the palace each of them is connected to.)

To transform the crown of silver needles into the crown of golden roses, it must be placed on Wrath's brow, but [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) doesn't know that. If the crown of silver needles is placed on [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md)'s head, [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) is banished to its demiplane along with the crown until Zybilna wills them both to return (which can't happen while she's trapped in temporal stasis).

In its gold form, the crown can be safely placed on [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md)'s head, even if the iron lion is dead. While [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) wears the crown, all lion-marked doors throughout the palace become unlocked (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

[Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) is willing to let the characters take the crown from it temporarily, but it wants something in exchange each time it relinquishes the crown: a lei made from flowers found in the palace garden (area P2). A single character needs 1 hour to pick the flowers and fashion the lei, but multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. The lei must be presented to [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) as a gift and draped over its shoulders. To determine whether [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) is satisfied, each character who contributed to the necklace's creation can make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check. On a successful check, the lei is deemed acceptable, and [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) relinquishes the crown. If any character's check total is 25 or higher, the lei is deemed extraordinary, and from that point on, [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) relinquishes the crown whenever the characters ask for it.

#### P10. Wrath's Tower

The base of this tower is 10 feet higher than the garden floor. The double door to this tower is accessible from a 10-foot-high stone catwalk that connects it with the servants' quarters (area P15). A bronze plaque above the door bears the word "Wrath" in Common. The tower is 30 feet tall and has no roof, enabling characters to enter it from above if they have the means to do so.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This tower is filled with hawthorns. At the heart of the thicket, a hart seemingly made from iron stands atop a marble pedestal, pawing the ground angrily. Strewn around the pedestal are a dozen empty baskets.
> 
> "We are Wrath," says the iron hart.
^38b

The iron hart, Wrath, is the counterpart to the iron lion named [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) in area P9. Wrath uses the [gorgon](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/gorgon.md) stat block. It can speak Common and Sylvan, and it refers to itself using the pronouns "we" and "us."

Wrath dislikes [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md), but the two are prevented by Zybilna's magic from harming one another. When the characters first appear before the iron hart, it demands their obeisance and commands them to kneel before it. If the characters do as Wrath commands, the hart is pleased and allows them to remain in its presence. Characters who fail to show it deference are instructed to leave the tower at once, and Wrath attacks those who refuse. Wrath knows the same information that [Envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md) knows (see area P9).

To transform the crown of silver needles from area P8 into the crown of golden roses, it must be placed on Wrath's brow, but Wrath doesn't know that. While Wrath wears the gold crown, all hart-marked doors in the palace are unlocked (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter). This holds true even if the iron hart is dead.

Wrath is willing to let the characters take the crown from it temporarily, but it wants something in exchange each time it relinquishes the crown: a basket of berries picked from the palace garden (area P2). If they so desire, the characters can take one of the baskets from the tower and use it to collect the berries. A single character needs 1 hour to pick the berries, but multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. The berries must be presented to Wrath as a gift, whereupon the iron hart devours them. To determine whether Wrath is satisfied, each character who picked any of them can make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check. On a successful check, the berry selection is deemed acceptable, and Wrath relinquishes the crown. If any character's check total is 25 or higher, the berry selection is deemed extraordinary, and from that point on, Wrath relinquishes the crown whenever the characters ask for it.

#### P11. Carriage House

When the characters open one of the doors leading to this chamber and peer inside, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The doors swing open to reveal a crystal carriage hitched to a pair of glass statues shaped like pegasi. Folded silk butterfly wings are attached to the roof of the carriage.
^38e

Zybilna used this flying carriage to travel to other locations in the Feywild. The carriage's doors are sealed shut, with no handles, hinges, or keyholes. Zybilna kept the carriage's magic key inside the vehicle and used [misty step](/compendium/spells/misty-step.md) spells to retrieve it as needed. The carriage's crystal structure is mostly opaque except for its windows. Anyone who looks through a carriage window spots an ornate glass key resting on the seat inside. To reach the key, a character must smash a window or use magic. Characters who smash their way into the carriage alert [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) (see area P30), who investigates the noise.

The carriage is a Huge object with AC 13, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Its windows and wheels are separate objects, each with AC 13, 10 hit points, and the same vulnerability and immunities as the rest of the carriage. Five Medium or smaller creatures can fit comfortably inside the cab, with an additional seat up front for the driver.

If the key is held within 3 inches of the door on either side of the carriage, a keyhole magically appears on the door's surface. Turning the key clockwise in the keyhole unlocks both carriage doors and animates the [glass pegasi](/compendium/bestiary/construct/glass-pegasus-wbtw.md), causing them to stamp their hooves impatiently. They use the [pegasus](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/pegasus.md) stat block, with these changes:

- The glass pegasi are Constructs with immunity to [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) and the [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [paralyzed](/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), and [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) conditions.
- They have AC 15 while animated and AC 13 otherwise.

While the glass pegasi are animated, reins made of starlight appear in the hands of anyone who sits on the driver's seat, allowing that individual to steer the carriage. The pegasi can pull the carriage at a speed of 40 feet on land or 80 feet while flying.

Turning the key counterclockwise in either door's lock can be done only while the carriage is on the ground and not moving; doing so locks both doors and causes the pegasi to revert to inanimate glass statues.

##### Development

Characters can use the carriage to travel beyond Prismeer to other locations in the Feywild, but the carriage and its glass pegasi shatter if the vehicle leaves the Feywild.

#### P12. Hall of Stars

The double door on the south side of this area is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls of this hall are illustrated with painted panels depicting a starry sky. The paintings show what a viewer would see while looking out through a set of windows into a clear, moonless night.
^391

There is nothing peculiar about the panels.

The two doors on the north wall open onto stone balconies that overlook a stormy void (area P13) and offer clear views of the tower and the staircases suspended above it.

#### P13. Court of Storms

The double door on the stone balcony between this area and area P22 is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter). The balcony doors that adjoin areas P11, P12, P15, and P29 are not locked.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This rectangular courtyard is open to the twilit sky. It has no visible floor; instead, a vortex of dark clouds churns below. A marble tower rising from the maelstrom is encircled by seven turrets. Four stone staircases extend from the outer areas of the palace to the tower, each one part of a buttress that spans the void and stabilizes the tower.
^393

If the characters are in a location where they can see the hole in the wall of area P47 on the tower's second floor, add:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Part of the tower wall has exploded outward, and its stony fragments are hanging in the air as though time around them has stopped. Among the debris, suspended above the stormy vortex, is an armored knight with a sword in one hand and a shield on his other arm. He looks like he was thrown backward through the exploding wall before being frozen in place.
^394

The knight suspended in the air is [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md) (see area P47), the leader of Valor's Call. It's obvious to anyone who can see him that the knight will plunge into the vortex if the time-freezing effect on him is ended.

##### Storm Vortex

The vortex that churns below the central spire is not part of the palace and wasn't frozen in time. Although the storm is magical, it can't be dispelled, and the area it occupies is heavily obscured.

Any creature that falls into the vortex takes 18 (4d8) force damage. In addition, its speed becomes 0 feet, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it can't be seen by others. The creature takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns until it escapes the vortex. Any creature that ends its turn in the vortex with 0 hit points is ripped to shreds, and its remains are scattered across the planes of existence along with anything it was wearing or carrying.

Any creature that falls into the vortex has little chance of surviving. If someone throws one end of a rope into its space, the creature can grab hold of it and be pulled out.

#### P14. Spiral Staircases

Areas P14a through P14d are on the palace's lower level, while areas P14e through P14h are on the upper level. All eight rooms have similar decor:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls of this circular chamber are decorated with sculpted reliefs depicting humans and demons partaking in grotesque revels. A spiral staircase with a golden handrail is in the middle of the room.
^397

The reliefs hint at Zybilna's fondness for demons. Specifics about each room are provided below:

- **P14a.** The spiral staircase ascends 30 feet to area P14e. To the northeast, an elevated staircase extends over part of the Court of Storms (area P13) and leads to one of the turrets of the central tower (area P48g on the upper level).
- **P14b.** The spiral staircase ascends 30 feet to area P14f. To the northwest, an elevated staircase extends over part of the Court of Storms (area P13) and leads to one of the turrets of the central tower (area P48b on the upper level).
- **P14c.** The spiral staircase ascends 30 feet to area P14g. The double door leading to the ballroom (area P22) is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).
- **P14d.** The spiral staircase ascends 30 feet to area P14h. The double door leading to the ballroom (area P22) is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).
- **P14e.** The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area P14a. A double door leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the palace garden (area P2).
- **P14f.** The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area P14b. A double door leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the palace garden (area P2).
- **P14g.** The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area P14c. A double door leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the Court of Storms (area P13).
- **P14h.** The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area P14d. A double door leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the Court of Storms (area P13). Floating 10 feet above the top of the staircase is a [banshee](/compendium/bestiary/undead/banshee.md) trapped in temporal stasis. The banshee is all that remains of a vainglorious elf queen named Pari Astarabad, who challenged Zybilna for control of Prismeer and paid the ultimate price. The banshee is condemned to haunt this tower and, thanks to Zybilna's magic, can't leave it. If freed from temporal stasis, the banshee can move between this area and area P14d, but nowhere else.

#### P15. Servants' Quarters

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This candlelit workroom contains tables, dressers, and bunks for the palace staff. Five goblins are frozen in place like statues, caught in the mundane chores of ironing clothes, darning socks, and folding sheets. A row of brass bells is mounted on one wall.
^399

The five goblins (unarmed, chaotic good noncombatants loyal to Zybilna) are frozen in time. The bells on the wall ring whenever occupants of the guest wing (areas P40a through P40e) tug on the bell pulls in their rooms.

##### Butler

Zybilna's butler, [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) (neutral), lurks in this room. [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) was away on an errand when the palace was frozen in time. Since his return, he has been spying on the members of the League of Malevolence.

[Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) can be encountered anywhere inside the palace but returns to this room to rest. He has the statistics of a [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md), except he is a Fey who speaks Common, Elvish, and Sylvan. He appears as a stick-thin man dressed in a brown dress coat, stockings, and buckled shoes. As an action, [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) can make himself as flat as a piece of parchment or revert to his normal thickness. In his flattened form, he can slide under doors, roll himself up, or even fold himself into the pages of a book.

The butler knows the palace's layout and defenses, but he's not inclined to share information with strangers. As soon as he hears a door to this room being opened, [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) ducks into the narrow space under or behind one of the dressers. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher notice [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) as they casually survey the room; a thorough search of the room finds him automatically. [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md), who has no reason to trust the characters, refuses to emerge from his hiding place. A character can earn the butler's trust and coax him out by reciting Demitasse's rhyme (see area P19) and then sharing a secret with him. (Any old fact will do, as long as he doesn't know it already.) If his trust is earned or the characters capture him, [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) shares the following information:

- After using Zybilna's cauldron to neutralize the archfey and most of her court, the hags of the Hourglass Coven left the League of Malevolence in the palace to guard the cauldron. Only three members of the league—[Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md), [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md), and [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md)—are in the palace presently.
- Years ago, Zybilna befriended a jabberwock and trained it to drink from her cauldron. It still frequents the palace and loiters around the cauldron, making it impossible for [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) and the others to guard the cauldron effectively. The only creature in the palace that stands a chance in a fight against the jabberwock is Zybilna's great owl, Bloodybeak, which is kept in the aviary (area P20).
- To free a creature frozen in time, one must touch it with a unicorn horn while speaking the creature's true name. ([Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) knows that "Zybilna" is not Zybilna's true name. He thinks her true name is Iggwilv, but it's not.) The League of Malevolence is searching Prismeer for a unicorn horn so that [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) can free [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md), his archenemy, from temporal stasis and steal his [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md).

Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md).

##### Treasure

The bottom drawer of [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md)'s dresser contains the butler's collection of rings. Many of the rings are rewards from Zybilna for faithful service, and others were gifted to him by guests who learned about his obsession. The collection includes the following:

- Sixty-one ornate silver rings (10 gp each)
- Thirty ornate gold rings (25 gp each)
- An onyx ring (50 gp) that radiates an aura of illusion magic under the scrutiny of a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell (when worn, the ring creates illusory butterflies that flutter around the wearer)

#### P16. Palace Kitchen

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An eight-foot-tall, three-foot-diameter, multitiered cake rests on a large round table in this kitchen, which also contains a stove and an assortment of mismatched cupboards and worktables. Eight pixies are suspended in midair around the cake, each wearing a chef's hat and a flour-stained apron. Six of the pixies squeeze cloth tubes that have icing coming out of them. The other two hold armfuls of tiny crimson candles.
> 
> Thick creepers with broad leaves encroach on the kitchen through a partially open door in the middle of a concave wall. The roots stretch across the floor and coil around the large table, but not around a smaller, rectangular wheeled table that has three trussed-up giant rats on it.
^39d

The eight [pixies](/compendium/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) work for Zybilna as bakers, and they are frozen in time. In addition to the large cake described below, characters can see platters of blue-frosted cupcakes and candied apples on sticks, bowls of sugar-glazed button mushrooms, and bottles of eveningberry wine (a sweet, nonalcoholic drink).

##### Cake

This perfectly preserved cake was made for Zybilna's birthday. Made of cream, sponge, fruit, and white icing, the cake has eight tiers and weighs 100 pounds. If the characters want to move the cake safely, they can transfer it to the wheeled table.

##### Wheeled Table

Three [giant rats](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-rat.md), frozen in time, lie atop the small table. The rats are meant to be fed to Bloodybeak, the great owl in area P20.

#### P17. Base of the Beanstalk

An open doorway leading from the kitchen (area P16) has thick creepers spreading through it.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Here, the palace has been torn asunder by the growth of an enormous beanstalk that has lifted one of its towers high into the air. The space beyond the open doorway is choked with rubble and the thick roots that form the beanstalk's base.
^3a1

The tower above is area P51. Zybilna's quasit, Iggrik, used a potion from his mistress's laboratory (area P42) to grow the beanstalk and cause the tower to be lifted to its present height.

The beanstalk is 80 feet high, elevating the floor of the tower 20 feet above the palace roof. A creature that can fly can reach the tower easily enough. A creature can climb the beanstalk without needing magic or climbing gear, but doing so requires a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a check that fails by 5 or more, the creature falls.

The beanstalk has AC 15 and is impervious to most forms of damage. If it is struck with the [woodcutter's axe](/compendium/items/woodcutters-axe-wbtw.md) (see area P6), the beanstalk shrinks 5 feet for every hit point of damage the weapon deals. If the beanstalk takes enough damage to reduce its height to 50 feet, the tower drops to its original position (so that the floor of area P51 is level with the second floor of the palace), and the beanstalk dies.

#### P18. Banquet Hall

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Paintings of fey creatures and the mounted heads of majestic elk with golden horns decorate the walls of this dining hall. In the middle of the hall, a deformed giant squats at the head of a table piled with food. The grease-stained tablecloth is tucked under the giant's chin, and she washes down each slobbering mouthful of food with a gulp from a barrel of beer.
> 
> A tea cart in one corner of the banquet hall has an iron kettle and a tureen of steaming soup resting on doilies atop it.
^3a3

The balcony extends out over the western part of this chamber, as indicated by the dashed line on the map. See area P32 for more information about the balcony.

Dubhforgail, the gluttonous [fomorian](/compendium/bestiary/giant/fomorian.md), intends to conquer Prismeer. Three days ago, she scaled the column of rock atop which the palace is perched and entered through a hole in the wall (see area P25). [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) used every ounce of his charisma to lure Dubhforgail into the banquet hall, hoping to keep her out of his way until the Hourglass Coven can deal with her. Dubhforgail has eaten nearly all the palace's food, yet her appetite remains insatiable. She has no regard for the rules of conduct (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2).

Dubhforgail assumes the characters are [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md)'s minions and demands that they bring her the cake that [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) promised her ("Eight tiers high, lit with blood-red candles, and icing white as snow"). She warns them that if they leave and return without it, she'll gobble them up instead "to see if you taste as sweet as you look." Dubhforgail is wicked and violent; if the characters anger her now or later, she snatches up her club and attacks. If treated to the cake from area P16, Dubhforgail settles down to eat it over the next 3 hours. During this time, characters can move freely through the banquet hall without angering the fomorian.

##### Tea Cart

The tea cart's drawers contain utensils, candlesticks, teacups, saucers, bowls, and napkins. The cart and its contents animate whenever someone sits at a table on the terrace (see area P19 for details).

#### P19. Dining Terrace

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Bathed in twilight, this marble terrace offers a stunning view of the mountains, forests, swamps, and shimmering horizons of Prismeer. Spaced about the balcony are tables draped in white tablecloths with chairs set around each one.
^3a6

If one or more characters take seats at a table, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The tea cart from the banquet hall rolls onto the terrace and careens over to your table. Cups, saucers, bowls, utensils, and napkins fly out of the cart's drawers and arrange themselves before you. They are joined by a waddling cauldron of soup, a piping-hot tea kettle, and a pair of lit candles in candlesticks. A serving spoon hops onto the cart, bows, and says in Common, "I am Demitasse, your head waiter. I believe a light supper of tea and soup is in order."
^3a7

Magic similar to an [animate objects](/compendium/spells/animate-objects.md) spell makes the cart and its collection of objects act as described. The kettle and the cauldron never run out of tea and hot soup, provided they remain inside the palace grounds.

A creature that drinks both the tea and the soup gains 10 temporary hit points—a benefit each creature can gain only once every 24 hours.

Demitasse, the only animated object on the cart that can speak, is impeccably polite and treats guests with respect. As tea is served, it compliments the characters on their appearance, their manners, or whatever else it thinks might make them happy. Characters who speak to Demitasse about Zybilna learn the following information:

- Zybilna is a powerful archfey who acts as a fairy godmother to destitute mortals. Those whom Zybilna aids are immortalized as glass statues in a room above the banquet hall.
- A bearded man with a nasty disposition ([Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md)) watches over the palace. He has been feeding the fomorian in the banquet hall ever since she invaded the palace three days ago.
- Although it doesn't know how Zybilna and her palace came to be frozen in time, Demitasse reports that Zybilna's butler, [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md), was not affected and claims that he knows more about the palace than anyone. Demitasse also knows that [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) is likely to be found in the servants' quarters (area P15), and that he's slow to trust others.

If the characters haven't already earned [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md)'s trust, Demitasse advises them to share one or more secrets with the timid butler after luring him out of hiding with the following rhyme:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> _Slip underneath the doorway,_
> 
> _Then fold and disappear._
> 
> _That's where you'll be hiding_
> 
> _Whenever I am near._
> 
> _But I have something for you,_
> 
> _A thing you don't yet know._
> 
> _I'll tell you my great secret_
> 
> _If only you will show._
^3a8

#### P20. Aviary

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An enormous owl stands perfectly still in the middle of this room, its wings partially outstretched. A wall of iron bars stretching from floor to ceiling forms a protective barrier around the chamber's entrance, keeping visitors separated from the owl. The wall across from the double door has a twenty-foot-wide, circular opening sealed with hinged, semicircular windows in wrought-iron frames. The marble floor is littered with the bones of giant rats.
^3ab

The bars that surround the double door can't be bent or damaged, but characters can use [misty step](/compendium/spells/misty-step.md) spells and similar magic to bypass them. The bars are 1 foot apart, leaving gaps wide enough for a Small character or a thin Medium character to squeeze through.

##### Bloodybeak

The owl uses the [roc](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/roc.md) stat block, has [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet, and is presently frozen in time. It takes up most of the room, and one of its wings brushes up against the wall of bars. [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) the butler (see area P15) knows the owl's true name: Bloodybeak. With this knowledge, characters can use the unicorn horn to free the owl from its temporal stasis, if they want to do so.

Bloodybeak is friendly toward Zybilna and hostile toward all other creatures. When the owl is no longer frozen in time, any creature within the owl's reach that Bloodybeak can see can use an action to make a DC 17 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check. On a successful check, the owl becomes indifferent toward that creature for 1 minute or until the owl takes damage from any source. A character can use an action to repeat the check as often as desired. A creature toward which Bloodybeak is indifferent can move through the aviary and try to open the big windows without being attacked by the owl.

Bloodybeak is a natural enemy of the jabberwock in area P22. If the owl is released from temporal stasis, it attacks the jabberwock on sight.

##### Windows

Bloodybeak is too big to enter the palace's hallways, so it comes and goes through the aviary's great windows, which at present are magically sealed shut. A [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic opens the windows, as does speaking the command word "canzus" within 10 feet of them. Only Zybilna and her quasit, Iggrik, know the command word.

#### P21. Records Room

The door to this area is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls of this room are lined with square compartments holding bundles of rolled paper scrolls. In the middle of the room, an elderly dwarf in gray robes, with spectacles resting on the tip of his bulbous nose, sits perfectly still behind a writing desk facing the door. The dwarf's quill is dipped halfway into an inkpot, and his bloodshot eyes are fixed on a sheet of parchment in front of him.
^3af

This room contains records of Zybilna's dealings with mortals, including contracts, pacts made with warlocks, and transcripts of conversations, all written in the Infernal script. The dwarf in temporal stasis is Kalimanzaros, Zybilna's clerk. If his statistics become necessary, Kalimanzaros uses the [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) stat block, with these changes:

- Kalimanzaros speaks Abyssal, Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Infernal, and he has [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.
- He has advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage.

Kalimanzaros has served Iggwilv for hundreds of years and still calls her by that name in private. He would never betray her or divulge information that could be used against her.

##### Unfinished Letter

The letter in front of Kalimanzaros reads as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> _Dear Rotten Ethel_,
> 
> _You have requested access to ancient rituals handed down by Baba Yaga herself—rituals that can be used to fulfill bargains. I regret to inform you that Iggwilv is unwilling to share her knowledge of these rituals with you at this time. Your coven has much work to do to earn her favor. Until then, she wishes you well in your dark dealings with mort_
^3b1

Kalimanzaros's quill ran dry before he could finish writing the word "mortals."

##### Treasure

Kalimanzaros keeps a spellbook on his person. This spellbook can't be removed from the dwarf while he's frozen in time, and it contains all the spells Kalimanzaros has prepared.

#### P22. Ballroom

The doors to areas P13, P14c, and P14d are sealed with lion crown locks (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A grand ballroom lies before you, the northern part of its floor littered with the splintered remains of three doors that have been knocked from their hinges, leaving openings through which you can see adjoining rooms.
> 
> Throughout the ballroom, royal courtiers stand motionless, their eyes fixed on a black iron cauldron atop a dais in the middle of the chamber. Dark vapors rise from the cauldron, and a huge, dragon-like monster is coiled around it. The dragon's body twitches slightly, and its closed eyelids flutter as it dreams.
> 
> Two figures are frozen, statue-like, off to one side of the cauldron: an imperious, middle-aged woman with long white hair and white robes, and a younger woman clad in armor and wearing a white cape. The older woman is reaching desperately toward the cauldron, while the armored woman at her side is grasping a fine-looking quarterstaff.
^3b4

A [jabberwock](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/jabberwock-wbtw.md) (see appendix C) is coiled around the cauldron. Zybilna treated the jabberwock like a pet, regularly inviting it into her palace to feed from her cauldron. It continues to visit the palace even now that Zybilna is frozen in time, has fed recently, and is sound asleep. Characters can move quietly about the room without waking it. Loud noises cause it to awaken, as do attacks made against it and any attempts to use or disturb the cauldron. Crafty characters who don't want to engage the jabberwock in battle can try to lure it elsewhere, either by using themselves as bait or by playing music (see the "Beware the Jabberwock!" sidebar).

> [!quote] Beware the Jabberwock!
> 
> Overcoming the jabberwock in area P22 is one of the main challenges of this chapter and, indeed, the whole adventure. The characters are unlikely to survive a head-on fight with the creature, but there are things they can do to increase their chances of survival:
> 
> - Free the great owl from the aviary (area P20) and set it against the jabberwock. Characters toward whom the owl is indifferent can easily put the owl in a jabberwock-hunting mood if they have the means to speak with it. If the jabberwock and the owl ever make eye contact, the jabberwock flees the palace with the owl in pursuit.
> - Bait the jabberwock into leaving the palace. The jabberwock will follow prey or the sound of music. Once lured outside, assuming it's not set upon by the great owl immediately, the jabberwock goes hunting and does not return for 1d6 + 2 hours.
> - Obtain [Snicker-Snack](/compendium/items/snicker-snack-wbtw.md), the vorpal sword in area P50. The jabberwock is vulnerable to its slashing damage, and the sword's attacks can neutralize the jabberwock's Regeneration trait.
> 
> The jabberwock is friendly toward Zybilna and hostile toward everything else, though it thinks twice about attacking anything bigger than itself. Throwing food at the jabberwock might distract it long enough to allow characters to flee its presence without risk of pursuit. Befriending the jabberwock isn't an option.
^beware-the-jabberwock

[Iggwilv the Witch Queen](/compendium/bestiary/npc/iggwilv-the-witch-queen-wbtw.md) (see her stat block at the end of the chapter), known in Prismeer as Zybilna, stands near the cauldron alongside a human cleric named [Mercion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mercion-wbtw.md) (see appendix B).

##### Cauldron

[Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) (see appendix A) is currently in its iron form. The characters can break the time-freezing spell on every creature and object in the palace by destroying the cauldron with a flame tongue or frost brand weapon, or by touching the cauldron with a unicorn horn while reciting a poem called "The Witch Queen's Cauldron." Only Zybilna and the hags of the Hourglass Coven know the words to this poem, but a [legend lore](/compendium/spells/legend-lore.md) spell or similar magic can also reveal them:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> _Eight cats perch atop eight dead attending_
> 
> _Eight lizards flee from eight rats scavenging_
> 
> _Eight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling_
> 
> _Eight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming_
> 
> _Eight eyes open, always dreaming_
> 
> _All on the cauldron that is ever seeming._
^3b7

##### Freeing Zybilna

A character can use an action to touch Zybilna with a unicorn horn while speaking her true name (Natasha). Doing so ends the time-freezing effect on her. Speaking the name Tasha, Zybilna, or Iggwilv doesn't work, since none of those is her true name.

Destroying the cauldron frees not only Zybilna but also every other creature in the palace that is frozen in time.

When Zybilna is freed from temporal stasis, skip ahead to "Ending the Story" at the end of the chapter.

##### Freeing Mercion

Any member of Valor's Call can identify [Mercion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mercion-wbtw.md), the armored cleric at Zybilna's side. Once the characters know who she is, one of them can use an action to touch [Mercion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mercion-wbtw.md) with a unicorn horn while speaking her name, ending the time-freezing effect on her.

If she is questioned, [Mercion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mercion-wbtw.md) shares the story of Valor's Call (see "Fall of the Witch Queen" earlier in the chapter). She willingly joins any group committed to overcoming the League of Malevolence.

##### Courtiers

In addition to Zybilna, [Mercion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mercion-wbtw.md), and the jabberwock, this room contains the following courtiers, all dressed in fancy garb and frozen in time:

- A pompous [bullywug knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bullywug-knight-wbtw.md) (see appendix C) and an emissary of the Soggy Court (see chapter 2) named Lord Slubb, the Marquis of Brackishbog
- Two [drow mages](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/drow-mage.md) (chaotic good) named Kelchrin and Valtis, who counsel Zybilna on matters concerning demons and the Abyss
- Snitcher, a [goblin boss](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin-boss.md) (neutral) with dragonfly wings that grant a flying speed of 40 feet and the ability to hover, who brings news from other fey courts and is attended by four similarly winged [goblins](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) (neutral bodyguards)
- Seven [pixies](/compendium/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) named Bix, Henny, Honeybright, Nightglitter, Starpetal, Trick, and Winterflake
- Two [quicklings](/compendium/bestiary/fey/quickling-mpmm.md) (see appendix C) who serve Zybilna as messengers and spies

##### Treasure

[Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) is an artifact, albeit one that its rightful owner would never part with. While she is trapped in stasis, Iggwilv can't stop thieves from taking the cauldron or hiding it. If they so desire, the characters can use [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md)'s flame tongue sword to shatter the cauldron, then do whatever they want with the fragments.

Between them, Iggwilv and [Mercion](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mercion-wbtw.md) have a [robe of the archmagi](/compendium/items/robe-of-the-archmagi.md), an [amulet of the planes](/compendium/items/amulet-of-the-planes.md), and a +1 quarterstaff. Iggwilv also keeps a gray stone (the control gem for the gray slaad in area P33) in the pocket of her robe. These items are not likely to fall into the characters' hands.

#### P23. Round Table

The doors leading into this room have been knocked from their hinges, and the doorways are wide open. Creatures that make too much noise here wake the [jabberwock](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/jabberwock-wbtw.md) (see appendix C) in area P22, which promptly investigates.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This chamber contains a round, marble-topped table ringed by high-backed chairs. Between the table and a curved wall of tall, slender windows stands a motionless, white-haired wizard wielding a staff that has glittering frost erupting from its tip.
^3bd

[Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) (see appendix B) was ambushed in here by two members of the League of Malevolence, [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md) and [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md). The wizard was using his [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md) to cast a [cone of cold](/compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md) spell when he became frozen in time. Freeing [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) from his temporal stasis unleashes the magic of the spell, the effect of which erupts out to fill most of the room.

Once he is no longer frozen in time, [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) is determined to defeat the League of Malevolence before it can cause any more mischief. He volunteers an explanation of how Valor's Call came to the palace (see "Fall of the Witch Queen" earlier in the chapter).

##### High-Backed Chairs

One of the chairs has a smiling quasit carved into its back, near the top. If anyone other than Zybilna sits in this chair, the quasit magically shouts "This is not your chair!" in Abyssal, repeating the line every minute until the creature gets out of the chair.

##### Round Table

Zybilna uses the round table for meetings with her counselors. Characters who examine its marble surface find the following inscription engraved on it in the Elvish script: "I rule by the verdict of my heart and the slam of my fist."

Striking the table with a clenched fist causes it to emit a thunderous boom that can be heard up to 10 miles away. Zybilna used this power of the table to emphasize her verdicts; she also exploited it to summon the jabberwock for its dinner. If the jabberwock is still alive, it comes running if it hears this sound.

##### Treasure

[Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) carries a [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md) with 15 charges remaining. (The staff has 20 charges when fully charged. Five charges were expended when [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) used it to cast [cone of cold](/compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md). The staff can't recharge until [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) is released from temporal stasis.)

#### P24. Ruined Staterooms

The jabberwock destroyed the furnishings in these two rooms and smashed through the doors leading to areas P22, P23, and P25. Nothing of value remains.

#### P25. Bathing Room

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Steam rises from a murky bathing pool. The tiled floor around the bath is cracked and ruined, as though something huge had stomped across it. Whatever caused this damage also left a gaping hole in one wall, through which you can see open air and the twilight sky.
^3c3

If the characters make any loud noises here and have not yet encountered the [jabberwock](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/jabberwock-wbtw.md) (see appendix C) in area P22, it awakens and investigates. The jabberwock enters and leaves the palace through the hole in the wall. It occasionally bathes in the murky pool and also hides its treasure there.

##### Treasure

The water in the pool is 8 feet deep and opaque. At the bottom of the pool, amid the bones of fairies and goblins that the jabberwock has devoured, are the following treasures:

- A pair of silver armlets (25 gp each)
- An ornate steel dagger that whispers "soon" whenever its wielder falls asleep (50 gp)
- A silver helmet adorned with a black feather (125 gp)

#### P26. Changing Room

The door to the adjoining hallway is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> One wall of this chamber is lined with wooden cubicles, each containing a small bench and a hook for hanging clothes. Underfoot, a mosaic floor depicts images of demons.
^3c6

Any creature that hangs an article of its clothing on one of the cubicle hooks receives the benefit of an [invisibility](/compendium/spells/invisibility.md) spell that lasts for 1 hour or until the creature ends the effect on itself by attacking or casting a spell. After receiving this benefit, a creature cannot receive it again for 24 hours.

#### P27. Armory

The door to this room is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The room contains glass cabinets filled with a wide variety of weaponry. The weapons are so well constructed that it is difficult to tell if this display is an armory or a museum.
^3c8

The glass cabinets are unlocked, and the weapons in them are spectacular in appearance. The cabinets contain one of each weapon listed on the weapons and weapons tables in the "Player's Handbook". Being of particularly fine manufacture, they are worth twice the listed price. Each weapon is enchanted to shower its wielder with compliments. If complimented on its own form in return, a weapon glumly whispers, "Ah, but I'm not as fine as [Snicker-Snack](/compendium/items/snicker-snack-wbtw.md)," and then never speaks again.

#### P28. Library

The doors to the adjoining hallway are sealed with lion crown locks (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Leather-bound tomes fill the tall shelves of this grand library. Rolling ladders anchored to rails above the topmost shelves allow easy access to the higher books.
> 
> Appearing from behind a bookshelf is an elderly hunchbacked man carrying an open book. "This library is closed to visitors!" he says, snapping the book closed and making no effort to hide his surprise and his annoyance.
^3ca

Zybilna keeps her most esoteric tomes in a separate library upstairs (area P38), but this room still contains a vast collection of books on all manner of subjects. It exists in a demiplane. Because of the library's demiplanar nature, its occupants and contents were not frozen in time by [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md).

##### Shon and Gray

The librarian is a hunchbacked human [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) (neutral) named Shon. He speaks Abyssal, Common, Elvish, and Sylvan, and he has a secret known only to himself, Zybilna, and her quasit, Iggrik: his "hump" is a [giant wolf spider](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-wolf-spider.md) named Gray, which Shon hides under thick shawls. An [awaken](/compendium/spells/awaken.md) spell was cast on the spider, giving it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Elvish. Of the two, the spider knows the library better and is more adept at locating rare tomes. The spider defends Shon if the mage is attacked.

Shon confronts intruders and orders them to leave the library at once, claiming that no one may peruse the books without Zybilna's consent. Zybilna has made no such declaration, but Shon doesn't trust visitors not to steal the books. If necessary, he uses [suggestion](/compendium/spells/suggestion.md) spells to force intruders to "get out and stay out!" If the characters stubbornly refuse to leave, Shon tells them that Zybilna keeps her most prized books in a smaller upstairs library and urges them to explore it instead. He even takes the time to write down a list of eight book titles found there that might interest them (see area P38).

When Zybilna and her court were frozen in time, Shon was shielded by the library's demiplanar nature. He ventured forth to discover the League of Malevolence in charge. Shon is afraid of the league but has come to an agreement with its leader, [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md): the league will allow Shon to remain at his post, and in exchange, Shon (and his spider) will use the library to research time-freezing magic, with the goal of helping the league break the spell on [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) the wizard so that [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) can obtain the wizard's [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md) (in area P23). So far, Shon and Gray have found nothing helpful. Each of them can describe all five members of the league and knows that three of them—[Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md), [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md), and [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md)—are in the palace.

[Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) has told Shon that Zybilna was betrayed by the Hourglass Coven, and that the hags have entrusted the League of Malevolence with protecting [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md). The conversations that Shon has had with [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) suggest that the alliance between the league and the Hourglass Coven isn't as strong as [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) pretends it is. Gray overheard these conversations and knows this information as well.

If the characters tell Shon that they intend to free Zybilna and defeat the League of Malevolence, he shares the following information while showing them the door, determined to keep them from disturbing the books:

- A jabberwock has made its lair in the ballroom. [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md), the leader of the League of Malevolence, is terrified of it ("as he should be," Shon adds).
- [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md), a helmed warrior with a flaming sword, acts as [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md)'s bodyguard, but not out of loyalty. He's a cold-hearted mercenary who works for coin. The characters might be able to buy him off.
- Shon can describe all the properties of a [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md), having researched the subject recently.

Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Shon.

##### Shon's Spellbook

Shon carries his spellbook, which is a leather-bound tome with a charcoal sketch of a wolf spider on the title page. This book contains the following spells: [charm person](/compendium/spells/charm-person.md), [cone of cold](/compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md), [counterspell](/compendium/spells/counterspell.md), [darkvision](/compendium/spells/darkvision.md), [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [fireball](/compendium/spells/fireball.md), [fly](/compendium/spells/fly.md), [greater invisibility](/compendium/spells/greater-invisibility.md), [ice storm](/compendium/spells/ice-storm.md), [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md), [mage armor](/compendium/spells/mage-armor.md), [magic missile](/compendium/spells/magic-missile.md), [misty step](/compendium/spells/misty-step.md), [polymorph](/compendium/spells/polymorph.md), [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md), [shield](/compendium/spells/shield.md), [suggestion](/compendium/spells/suggestion.md), and [Tasha's hideous laughter](/compendium/spells/tashas-hideous-laughter.md).

##### Unicorn Horn

If the Story Tracker indicates that the unicorn horn is here, Shon has it. He doesn't want [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) to get his hands on the [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md), realizing the harm he would cause with it. Consequently, Shon has no intention of handing the staff over to the League of Malevolence. If, through good roleplaying, the characters convince Shon that they have Prismeer's best interests at heart, he gives them the horn and tells them where to find Zybilna (area P22), warning them about the jabberwock if he hasn't already done so.

#### P29. Rug of White Roses

The door to area P30 is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter). The door on the opposite wall opens onto a balcony that overlooks the Court of Storms (area P13).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Running the length of this oblong room is a rug woven with images of thorny white roses. Each of the doors on the north and south walls has an alabaster pedestal standing inside the room beside it. Atop each pedestal is an alabaster vase that holds several long-stemmed white roses. Carved into the vase are the words "Take one" in Common.
^3cf

A creature holding or carrying a white rose can pass through this hall safely. The rug is a 40-foot-long, 8-foot-wide [rug of smothering](/compendium/bestiary/construct/rug-of-smothering.md) with 60 hit points. If a creature not carrying a white rose ends its turn in the hall, the rug attacks it. The rug also attacks creatures that deal damage to it. Because of its length, the rug can smother up to four Medium or smaller creatures at once.

#### P30. Sludge-Filled Tower

The door to this tower is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Everything in this tower appears to be frozen in place. A five-foot-wide ledge at floor level circles the room, and a row of five iron levers protrudes from the wall above the ledge on the far side of the room. Five feet below the ledge is the surface of a pool of reeking sludge. Five slender, gilded cages dangle from chains that hang down from holes in the sixty-foot-high ceiling. Three of the cages are occupied. Suspended in midair outside each cage is a pixie holding a tiny, gilded wand.
^3d1

[Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) (see appendix B) is here if he hasn't been lured elsewhere. If [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) is present, add:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Standing motionless next to the levers is a man garbed in black whose face is half-hidden by a hood. A bat-shaped amulet hangs around his neck, and he tightly grips a quarterstaff.
^3d2

[Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) has been taking samples of the sludge in the pool, hoping to learn more about its properties. He stands motionless, pretending to be frozen in time like the other creatures here. If left alone, he waits for the characters to leave the area, then reports to [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) in area P31.

Characters who observe [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) can, with a successful DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, determine that he is not frozen in time. Because he's pretending to be frozen, the first attack made against him has advantage. If his ruse is exposed or if he's attacked, [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) uses his next action to cast [gaseous form](/compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md) on himself, then flies up to area P39 and heads to area P31 to warn [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) and [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) that intruders have entered the palace.

##### Cages and Pixie Jailers

The floors of the five cages are currently suspended above the sludge at heights of 10 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet, 40 feet, and 50 feet, respectively. Each cage's height is controlled by one of the levers on the far side of the narrow ledge. Normally, moving a lever up or down causes its cage to ascend or descend at a rate of 1 foot per second; at present, however, the mechanisms that raise and lower the cages are frozen in time, and until the time-freezing effect ends, nothing happens when any of the levers are moved.

Each cage can hold one Medium or smaller creature. The cages have no doors or locks; creatures are teleported into and out of the cages using the tiny, gilded wands carried by the five [pixies](/compendium/bestiary/fey/pixie.md), all of which are frozen in time. Only pixies can attune to these tiny wands. As an action, a pixie released from temporal stasis can use its wand to target a Medium or smaller creature it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, it is teleported into the gilded cage corresponding to that pixie, and any creature already occupying that cage teleports to the space vacated by the target. A pixie released from temporal stasis can use an action to touch its wand to its corresponding cage, which teleports any creature inside that cage to an unoccupied space of the pixie's choice on the ledge.

A character can use an action to try to bend a cage's bars, doing so with a successful DC 22 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check and creating an opening wide enough for a Small or Medium character to squeeze into or out of the cage.

##### Demonic Sludge

A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic emanating from the sludge, which comes from the Abyss. Any Humanoid that starts its turn wholly or partly immersed in the sludge must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage as its mind is ravaged by nightmarish visions too horrible to describe. On a failed save, the creature is magically transformed into a [manes](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/manes.md) under your control. This transformation can be reversed by any magic that ends a curse. If the transformation is not reversed within three days, it becomes permanent and can be reversed only by a [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell or divine intervention.

##### Prisoners

Three of the cages hold prisoners in temporal stasis:

- The cage suspended 10 feet above the sludge contains a [manes](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/manes.md).
- The cage suspended 20 feet above the sludge contains an [incubus](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md) in the guise of a male high elf named Nizran (not his true name). The incubus, whose Etherealness trait does not function in the Feywild, infiltrated Zybilna's court by pretending to be an emissary of the Summer Queen. Zybilna saw through the deception, ascertained the incubus's true allegiance to the demon lord Graz'zt (her former lover), and incarcerated the incubus before he could return to his true master.
- The cage suspended 40 feet above the sludge holds a nameless, unshaven man with a crescent-shaped scar under his right eye. A retired human [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) (neutral) from Oerth, he is unarmed. He begged Zybilna to rid him of the guilt he feels for several murders he committed. She obliged by locking him up and promising to transform him into a manes—a creature incapable of feeling guilt.

Even if they are freed from temporal stasis, the prisoners remain trapped in their cages until the pixies release them, which they can't do while frozen in time and which they're not inclined to do unless the order comes from Zybilna. Nizran and the nameless man want nothing more than to flee the palace and never return.

#### P31. Throne Room

This chamber can be reached by descending a staircase from area P47. A double door in the north wall pulls open to reveal a stone balcony that overlooks the Court of Storms (area P13).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A ring of marble pillars sculpted with images of fairies and demons supports the arched ceiling of this circular chamber. Seven archways spaced evenly around the room's perimeter lead to empty turrets with tall, stained-glass windows set in their walls. Each window bears the image of a knight in armor.
> 
> Near the middle of the room, a short, gray-bearded man in black robes reclines on a gilded wooden throne with clawed feet. The man grips the leashes of three small, scaly, birdlike creatures. A muscular, armored man stands next to the throne. He wears a helm that conceals his face except for his red, glowing eyes, and his sword he holds is wreathed in flames.
> 
> A statue of an unarmored elf stands in front of the throne. The statue is posed as if ready for battle, with a shortsword gripped tightly in each of its hands.
^3d7

The gray-bearded man is [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md), and he keeps three [cockatrices](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/cockatrice.md) on short leashes. [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) stands beside him, shield and flaming sword at the ready. If the characters encountered [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) previously and allowed him to get away, the evil priest of Orcus is crouched behind the throne. (Statistics for all three villains appear in appendix B.) While seated on the throne, [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) can use a bonus action to speak a rhyme taught to him by the Hourglass Coven ("Knights of glass, protect my ass!"). The rhyme causes the four stained-glass knights in the turrets marked X on the map to leap from their window frames, becoming four [glasswork golems](/compendium/bestiary/construct/glasswork-golem-wbtw.md) (see the accompanying stat block). These golems defend [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md), returning to their windows after 10 minutes if they haven't been destroyed by then.

If the characters parley with [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md), he sneers that the palace is now his to rule, though any mention of the Hourglass Coven or the jabberwock causes a flush of dread to pass over [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md)'s face. Throughout any conversation, [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) remains silent, eyeing the party mirthlessly. [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md), if present, does as little as possible to help [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) without revealing his treasonous heart. He wants to replace [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) as leader of the League of Malevolence, but he is certain [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) will slay him if he openly betrays [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md).

If the characters mention [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md), [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) explains that he wants the [staff of power](/compendium/items/staff-of-power.md) that belongs to the wizard, but he can't take it while [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md) is frozen in time. To free [Ringlerun](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md), [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) needs a unicorn horn. (He won't explain how the horn works.) In exchange for a unicorn horn, [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) promises to help the characters achieve their goals, provided their stated goals have nothing to do with freeing Zybilna. [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) has no intention of fulfilling his part of any bargain.

If conflict erupts, [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) relies on [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md), the cockatrices, and [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) to defend him. [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) flees if the battle is going poorly for his side.

[Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md)'s loyalty can be bought for a reasonable price (treasure worth 2,500 gp or more). If the characters recruit him, [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) stays with the party for the remainder of the adventure, then goes his own way. While in the party's employ, [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) stoically follows the characters around, defending them when needed, and can easily be persuaded to use his flame tongue sword to destroy [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md).

Neither [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) nor [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) will threaten or harm the characters while [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) is on the party's side. In the face of certain defeat, [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) begs for mercy and offers to reveal a secret about Zybilna in exchange for his life and freedom. If the party agrees, [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) reveals that Zybilna is [Iggwilv the Witch Queen](/compendium/bestiary/npc/iggwilv-the-witch-queen-wbtw.md) and explains how he plotted to blackmail her.

##### Petrified Elf

The statue is a [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) high elf named [Raezil](/compendium/bestiary/npc/raezil-wbtw.md) Uthemar (neutral). [Raezil](/compendium/bestiary/npc/raezil-wbtw.md) served as Zybilna's spy in other fey courts. She returned from a mission to find nearly everyone in the palace trapped in temporal stasis. When she confronted [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) and accused him of conspiring to overthrow Zybilna, his cockatrices [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) her. If magic is used to end the [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition on [Raezil](/compendium/bestiary/npc/raezil-wbtw.md), use the [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) stat block to represent her, with these changes:

- [Raezil](/compendium/bestiary/npc/raezil-wbtw.md) speaks Common and Elvish.
- She has [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.
- She has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put her to sleep.

The name "Iggwilv" means nothing to [Raezil](/compendium/bestiary/npc/raezil-wbtw.md), who started working for Zybilna shortly after the archfey carved out her domain in the Feywild. [Raezil](/compendium/bestiary/npc/raezil-wbtw.md) spends most of her time abroad, in the courts of other archfey, and hasn't kept up on the politics of Prismeer.

Once she is no longer [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified), [Raezil](/compendium/bestiary/npc/raezil-wbtw.md) is bound by the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2) to help the characters complete any outstanding quests they might have. [Raezil](/compendium/bestiary/npc/raezil-wbtw.md) comes from a highborn elf family with influence in the Summer Court, making her a useful retainer if the characters choose to remain in the Feywild after their adventures in Prismeer have ended.

##### Treasure

[Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) carries a [staff of striking](/compendium/items/staff-of-striking.md) and wears [bracers of defense](/compendium/items/bracers-of-defense.md). [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) wields a flame tongue longsword. [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md) wears a bat-shaped amulet that has the properties of a [ring of feather falling](/compendium/items/ring-of-feather-falling.md).

### Upper Palace Locations

#### P32. Minstrels' Gallery

This balcony extends out over the banquet hall (area P18). The door on the west wall is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This thirty-foot-high balcony overlooks the banquet hall. A harpsichord decorated with painted panels is situated at one end of the balcony near a double door.
^3dc

The harpsichord is a Medium object with AC 15, 12 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around it. If it loses half or more of its hit points, the harpsichord is too damaged to play music. Reducing the harpsichord to 0 hit points destroys it and causes eight pieces of wreckage to magically spring to life and attack the harpsichord's assailants. Each piece of wreckage is treated as a Tiny object under the effect of an [animate objects](/compendium/spells/animate-objects.md) spell that lasts for 1 minute.

#### P33. Glass Statues

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The floor of this marble hall is polished to a mirror-like finish. The exterior walls are lined with stained-glass windows depicting fairies and butterflies in flight. A glass statue of a long-haired woman in robes stands atop a dais, her arms outstretched in a welcoming gesture. A tiny, incandescent blue sphere is suspended in the air next to the statue's head. Dozens of other statues made of sparkling glass are arranged about the room.
^3de

This room contains forty glass statues, including the one on the dais. The statues stand motionless until someone plays the harpsichord in area P32, the magic of which causes the statues to dance:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> All of the statues except the one on the dais waltz and twirl about the room, their steps keeping time with the music from the harpsichord.
^3df

When the music from the harpsichord stops playing, the statues freeze in place until the music resumes.

Characters who have seen Zybilna recognize her likeness in the statue on the dais. The remaining thirty-nine statues represent mortals whom Zybilna aided in her role as fairy godmother. A glass scullery maid dances with a glass princess, a glass farmer carries a glass pot filled with glass coins, and so on. Each statue (including the one on the dais) has AC 13, 4 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

While the statues are dancing, any creature that enters the room or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid colliding with a statue. Reduce the DC by 1 for every three dancing statues that have been destroyed. A collision with a creature causes a statue to shatter and deals 14 (4d6) psychic damage to the creature that struck it. The dancing statues avoid the dais and can't collide with creatures on it, nor can they collide with creatures they can't reach (creatures flying above them, for example).

This statue on the dais doesn't move, and the tiny sphere floating next to its head is frozen in time and magical (see "Treasure" below). It remains suspended in the air above the dais even if the statue on the dais is destroyed.

##### Slaad Guardian

An [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) [gray slaad](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/gray-slaad.md) in its true form appears near the dais when one of the following conditions is met:

- Three or more dancing statues are destroyed.
- The statue on the dais is destroyed.
- Someone grabs the tiny sphere.

The slaad normally resides in a demiplane and was not affected by the time-freezing magic of [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md). It attacks any creature that has the tiny sphere in its possession, turning visible as it does so. If it obtains the sphere, the slaad keeps it, turns [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible), remains in this room, and defends itself if attacked. It can be harmed by the dancing statues.

Zybilna pressed the slaad into service, and it does her bidding if she's around to give it commands.

##### Treasure

The blue sphere is an [ Ioun stone (insight)](/compendium/items/ioun-stone-insight.md) that belongs to Iggwilv. Any other creature that attunes to the [Ioun stone](/compendium/items/ioun-stone-insight.md) is cursed. While cursed in this way, the creature is magically transformed into an animated, doll-like effigy of itself made of wood. The creature's statistics are the same, except that it is a Construct with vulnerability to fire damage, and it doesn't require air, food, or water. Items worn or carried by the creature are unaffected. A [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell can end the curse. The creature can end the curse on itself by giving a bouquet of eight black roses to Iggwilv, but only Iggwilv and Iggrik (the quasit in area P51) know that the curse can be ended in this way. The black roses can be harvested from the rose garden (area P7).

#### P34. Hall of Hatches

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Four three-foot-square oak panels are mounted on the wall along the east side of this short hall. Each panel has a hinged hatch attached to a wooden handle.
^3e3

When the characters first enter, all four panels are closed. Opening a hatch reveals a square cavity containing the head of a decapitated creature. When a hatch is opened, the head inside that cavity barks one of the following utterances:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Bugbear head: "Yah!"
> 
> Harpy head: "Bah!"
> 
> Hobgoblin head: "Gah!"
> 
> Ogre head: "Bah!"
^3e4

Each repeats its one-word utterance every time its hatch is opened, then falls silent until the hatch is closed and opened again. To use this area as it was intended, the panels must all be closed and then opened in either of the following sequences:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Harpy, ogre, bugbear, hobgoblin
> 
> Ogre, harpy, bugbear, hobgoblin
^3e5

When the decapitated heads speak the syllables of "Baba Yaga" in their proper order, all creatures in the hall are teleported to unoccupied spaces in the study (area P47).

#### P35. Flooded Hall

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This hallway has a sunken floor filled to a depth of three feet with dark water. Lanterns lit with flickering blue flames hang from the ceiling thirty feet above by short chains, spaced roughly ten feet apart. They produce eerie, ghostlike reflections off the water. As you take in the scene, an empty sailboat drifts into view from farther down the hall and makes its way toward you.
^3e7

The sailboat glides closer until it is near enough to board safely. The boat can carry up to eight Medium creatures. One creature can steer the boat using the tiller, and the boat has a speed of 20 feet.

##### Dark Water

Peering into the water's depths reveals thin, pale faces staring back, dark monsters swimming past, and glimpses of distant realms. A creature can wade through the water safely, but any creature that completely submerges itself must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become trapped under the water's surface. Unless the creature can breathe underwater, it begins to "suffocate" when it runs out of air (see the "suffocation" rules in the "Player's Handbook"). As an action, a creature trapped under the water's surface or another creature within reach of it can make a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a successful check, the trapped creature breaks through the surface and is no longer submerged.

#### P36. Costume Room

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This room contains eight wooden mannequins in tall glass cases. Each mannequin wears a different outfit.
^3ea

These outfits have been worn by Zybilna in her many guises—a child's witchy dress for young Natasha; a flamboyant, off-the-shoulder dress for Tasha; a dark, alluring gown for Iggwilv; and more.

The following clues can help the characters identify some of Zybilna's former personas:

- The name "Natasha" is stitched into the collar of a cape sized for a child.
- Characters who examined the mannequin of Tasha in the glass cabinet outside the Hall of Illusions in the Witchlight Carnival can recognize Tasha's costume from the way the mannequin was dressed.
- Characters who succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check can recognize one of Iggwilv's costumes from a woodcut of her that they saw once in a book, where she was identified as "Iggwilv, the Witch Queen of Perrenland."

#### P37. Dretch Nursery

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Flies buzz throughout this chamber, and the grimy marble floor is crawling with maggots. Eight wicker cradles stand upright in the filth. Lashed to each cradle is a three-foot-long, curved wooden pole with a mobile consisting of three ornaments dangling at the top of it. Each ornament appears to be a triangular piece of white wood with an Elvish letter carved into it. Small, misshapen creatures nesting in the cradles reach toward the symbols with their claws but can't quite grab them.
^3ec

The cradles contain eight [dretches](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/dretch.md)—manifestations of Zybilna's darkest emotions: annoyance, loathing, rage, disgust, disdain, maliciousness, [envy](/compendium/bestiary/npc/envy-wbtw.md), and jealousy. The stunted, baby-like fiends act according to their nature; for example, the annoyed dretch frowns in irritation at everything it sees, the malicious dretch tries to pinch anyone who comes too close to it, and so forth.

A character can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check to ascertain why the dretches are here and what they represent. On a failed check, the character ascertains nothing. On a successful check, the character realizes that the dretches are manifestations of suppressed negative emotions belonging to whoever confined them to this wretched nursery.

Characters who can read the Elvish script can identify seven different letters carved into the triangular ornaments suspended above the cradles. The letters, each of which appear several times, are A, B, I, L, N, Y, and Z. Rearranged, they spell ZYBILNA. Zybilna needed the lettered ornaments as material components for the ritual that created the dretches, but now they are merely decorative distractions for the baby-like dretches. The letters are attached to the mobiles at random; for example, one cradle's mobile might have the letters A, I, and L, while another might have the letters B, L, and Y.

Each dretch is bound by Zybilna's magic and has a speed of 0 feet while in its cradle. If a dretch is removed from its cradle, its disposition doesn't change, but it is free to go where it pleases. It shuns combat and fights only in self-defense. Killing one or more dretches causes an upswell of dark emotions in Iggwilv, which can have consequences for the characters in their climactic encounter with her (as described at the end of the chapter).

#### P38. Secret Library

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A dozen floating candles cast dim, flickering lights over this sepulchral, windowless library. Ebony bookshelves are filled with volumes bound in jet-black fabric. The books have no titles on their spines. In the middle of the room, a black quill pen rests on a writing desk next to a jar of black ink.
^3ee

Magic causes each candle to float 1d4 + 3 feet above the floor. Casting [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) on a candle or removing a candle from the library automatically ends the levitation effect on it.

If the characters remove a book from the shelves, they see that the cover, like the spine, has no title. Opening any of the books reveals that its pages are blank apart from the first page, on which a thin line has been scribed. If a creature uses the quill pen on the desk to write the title of a book above the line, the remaining pages of the book fill with writing that matches the book of the same title, provided that book is part of this room's collection. Writing a title in a blank book that does not match the title of a book in the collection causes the ink to swiftly evaporate from the page. If a book is removed from this library, all writing in it fades after 30 days, leaving the book blank.

Among the titles found here are the following, which the characters can learn about from Shon in area P28:

_The City That Waits_ (one explorer's treatise about Moil, a demiplane that houses a city of haunted spires)

_The Faceless Lord_ (Iggwilv's private account of her many dealings with Juiblex, the Demon Prince of Oozes and Slimes—which she later updated and incorporated into her magnum opus, the [Demonomicon of Iggwilv](/compendium/items/demonomicon-of-iggwilv-tce.md))

_I, Lyzandred_ (a lich's meandering autobiography, which drifts into a lengthy, plodding dissertation about demiplanes and how to construct them)

_Kingdom of the Ghouls_ (one adventuring party's exploration of a subterranean kingdom of ghouls on the world of Oerth)

_The Many Masques of Mith_ (a bizarre account of life as a servant to an archwizard named Mith, who hosted masques for honored guests from across the multiverse)

_Nadir of Nessus_ (all about the politics of the Nine Hells, written by a tiefling named Nadir, who claimed to be the daughter of Asmodeus)

_Prophecies of Explictica Defilus_ (a transcription of various prophecies told by a powerful spirit naga from the world of Oerth)

_Thingizzard's Night Balloon_ (instructions for building a magic vessel that can float safely through the layers of the Abyss)

#### P39. Roost

This 20-foot-square room has an 8-foot-wide, 8-foot-tall archway in the middle of the west wall, beyond which a tower chamber contains five cages dangling from chains above a pool of sludge 30 feet below. Characters who position themselves near the archway can see the ceiling of the tower chamber 30 feet above them, as well as the other features of area P30.

Floor-to-ceiling iron bars spaced 6 inches apart span the eastern side of this room. Through this wall of bars, one can see the palace's central tower suspended above a stormy void (area P13). The bars can be bent with a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, creating an opening through which Small and Medium characters can squeeze.

#### P40. Guest Wing

This wing of the palace is reserved for Zybilna's guests, including envoys from other archfey and petitioners from the Material Plane.

Each room holds a four-poster bed, a wardrobe containing outfits that magically tailor themselves to their wearers, and a dressing table. A bell pull mounted on the wall by the door enables guests to summon servants from their quarters (area P15). If the characters ring any of these bells, the butler [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) creeps up to investigate 5 minutes later.

Each room's occupants are frozen in time. Individual rooms have their own color schemes and notable features, as indicated below:

- **P40a.** Red Room. A high elf [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) (neutral) with long hair stands in the middle of the room. The elf, Carisso, is holding a crystal goblet of water. Tied to his belt is a glass-handled rapier (actually a +1 rapier). A goblin (noncombatant) stands next to him, holding a tray with a decanter of water on it.
- **P40b.** Blue Room. This chamber has a line of bluebirds perched motionless on the sill of an open window. The room is otherwise unoccupied.
- **P40c.** Green Room. A well-dressed forest gnome (noncombatant) stands on a stool in front of a vanity, looking into a mirror as she combs her green hair. The vanity has various cosmetics and vials of perfume on it.
- **P40d.** White Room. A handsome young male human (noncombatant) in a white nightshirt sleeps in the bed.
- **P40e.** Black Room. Six goblins (noncombatants) are in the midst of cleaning the room. One of them perches precariously on a stack of chairs while reaching out to dust the top of a tall black wardrobe.

#### P41. Talking Door

This door is closed and magically locked.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The surface of this double door is sculpted to look like the head of a cat. As you approach, it purrs, "Why, hello there."
^3f3

This door was meant to require a password to be opened, but the door grew bored of asking for the same word all the time and now seeks answers to more meaningful, philosophical questions. The door explains this pleasantly, then poses one of the following questions:

- Which is more important, intelligence or wisdom?
- Are we at the mercy of fate, or do we create our own destiny?
- Which has more power, the sword or the quill?

The door enthusiastically debates either side of each point. There are no right or wrong answers; to open the door, a character must argue their case and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. A character who impressed Feathereen, the gondola swan in the Witchlight Carnival, is filled with confidence in this debate and gains advantage on the check. On a successful check, the door swings open.

#### P42. Laboratory

The door to this laboratory is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Broken oil burners, grimy glassware, and jars of pickled fungus clutter this ruined laboratory. A beanstalk as long and thick as a constrictor snake sprouts from an unstoppered potion bottle. Bulging bean pods hang from its stem.
^3f5

Zybilna used this laboratory to brew potions, including an experimental oil that stimulated the growth of plants. The beanstalk in here is one result of this study; Zybilna's quasit, Iggrik, pilfered and used a more potent variant of this potion to create the enormous beanstalk in area P17.

##### Treasure

Characters who search the laboratory find a [potion of growth](/compendium/items/potion-of-growth.md), three [potions of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md), and two [potions of giant strength (hill)](/compendium/items/potion-of-hill-giant-strength.md).

Twelve bean pods hang on the beanstalk and are easily detached. A detached bean pod can be hurled up to 120 feet as an action. When it is tossed on the ground, it disappears and produces an effect identical to that of the [plant growth](/compendium/spells/plant-growth.md) spell (the version of the spell that takes 1 action to cast).

#### P43. Mirror of Heart's Desire

The door to this room is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This marble hall is empty except for a tall mirror mounted in an alcove on the north wall. Cold, spectral mist hangs motionless in front of the mirror's reflective surface and covers the floor beneath it.
^3f8

Zybilna brought mortals before this mirror, where they could see the objects of their heart's desire reflected in it. Any creature that stares into the mirror for 1 minute sees its own reflection fade away, to be replaced by an image of the thing it wants most. The mirror is a Large object with AC 13, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

If a character looks into the mirror long enough to trigger its property, work with that character's player to determine what the character sees: it might be something or someone the character lost, a goal the character has yet to attain, or a momentous event that has not yet come to pass. If you are using the "Lost Things" adventure hook and the character hasn't yet found what they're looking for, the mirror might show the character its location and a route the character can take to get there.

#### P44. Jars of Time

The door to this room is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A three-level mahogany table stands in the middle of this otherwise empty chamber. Three gleaming bell jars rest on the table's separate tiers, each one containing a visage wreathed in mist.
^3fa

Any creature that touches one of the jars on the table causes all three jars to display illusory images of that creature from different time periods. The jar closest to the floor shows the creature in its youth. The jar on the middle tier shows the creature as it is now. The highest jar shows what the creature might look like in its later years. Zybilna was the last one to touch the jars, so they currently show images of her past, present, and future self:

- The lowest jar depicts a young woman with raven-black hair.
- The middle jar displays a middle-aged woman with long white hair.
- The highest jar shows a white-haired crone or hag.

The jars are stuck to the table with [sovereign glue](/compendium/items/sovereign-glue.md). Each jar is a Small object with AC 13, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. For each jar that breaks, an [invisible stalker](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) is released, appearing in the air above the table. A stalker attacks whoever is responsible for breaking its jar, ignoring all other targets. The stalker returns to the Elemental Plane of Air when it or its target dies.

#### P45. Zybilna's Bedroom

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This spacious bedchamber is lightly furnished. An oval mirror in a black wood frame is mounted on the east wall, and a chess set with jet and bloodstone playing pieces rests atop an octagonal table in the southwest corner, flanked by two comfortable, high-backed chairs. A four-poster bed with black silk sheets and drapes stands in the middle of this room. Lounging on the bed are two creatures, each with the lower body of a lion. One has the head and upper torso of a woman, the other the head and upper torso of a man.
^3fc

The creatures on the bed are two [lamias](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/lamia.md) named Nemesatra and Trizzian. The demon prince Graz'zt sent them to parley with Zybilna, because he is convinced that the archfey knows the whereabouts of [Iggwilv the Witch Queen](/compendium/bestiary/npc/iggwilv-the-witch-queen-wbtw.md) (with whom Graz'zt has unfinished business). Nemesatra and Trizzian suspect that Zybilna and Iggwilv are the same person, but the lamias need proof before they return to their master.

Graz'zt has bestowed on each lamia the ability to touch the surface of any mirror (as an action), disappear inside it, and reappear on another plane of existence of their choice, as though the lamia had cast a [plane shift](/compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) spell that affects only one creature. Nemesatra and Trizzian used this ability to travel from Azzagrat (Graz'zt's home in the Abyss) to the Feywild, and they plan to use it again to return to Azzagrat once they get the proof they desire. The costumes in area P36 are not proof enough on their own, but any or all of the following constitute proof:

- The sworn testimony of [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) the butler (see area P15), Kalimanzaros the dwarf (see area P21), or one of the hags in area P47, which the lamias must obtain using a [suggestion](/compendium/spells/suggestion.md) or [geas](/compendium/spells/geas.md) spell
- A copy of _The Faceless Lord_ (one of Iggwilv's known unpublished works) from area P38
- The jars of time in area P44, provided and the jars still show three faces of Iggwilv (including her younger self, which the lamias recognize)

When one or more characters appear before the lamias, Nemesatra fixes them with a steely gaze and asks, "Are you important?" She expects an affirmative reply, for neither she nor her companion have time for wastrels. Nemesatra and Trizzian won't reveal the purpose of their mission. They view the characters as pawns, ordering them to share any information they uncover about Zybilna's past. Once the lamias obtain proof that Zybilna is Iggwilv (or cleverly fabricated evidence to the contrary), they use the nearest mirror to return to Azzagrat.

The lamias' access to the palace is limited because they can't bypass its locked doors or fly. They entered the palace through the coach house (area P11) and have visited areas P29, P14c, P14g, P41 (where they debated the magical door), and P46.

If the lamias are attacked, they defend themselves until at least one of them loses half of their hit points or more, whereupon they touch the mirror in this chamber and return to the Abyss. If the mirror has been destroyed and they have no clear route of escape, the lamias use [charm person](/compendium/spells/charm-person.md), [suggestion](/compendium/spells/suggestion.md), or [geas](/compendium/spells/geas.md) spells to persuade the characters to leave them alone.

##### Treasure

The chessboard was a gift to Iggwilv from the archmage Mordenkainen and is worth 2,500 gp. Its pieces mutter under their breath when they are taken off the board. The chessboard is one reason why Nemesatra and Trizzian suspect that Zybilna and Iggwilv might be one and the same, since Iggwilv's passion for the game is well known to Graz'zt and his underlings.

#### P46. Dressing Room

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This chamber is a walk-in wardrobe. Hinged panels along the walls swing outward to display a variety of exquisitely crafted robes, gowns, scarves, headdresses, stockings, gloves, shoes, boots, and other clothing. Items remove themselves from hooks and hangers and float in the air seemingly of their own accord, allowing you to see them more closely.
^3ff

Permanent [unseen servant](/compendium/spells/unseen-servant.md) spells make trying on clothes in this room easy and fun.

#### P47. Destroyed Study

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Splinters of wood, along with some loose papers and two halves of a shattered blowing horn, are suspended in the air. Whatever caused this unfortunate scene also punched a hole in the north wall on the landing between two staircases, one leading up and the other leading down. The stony debris from the blast is frozen in midair outside the tower.
^401

Characters who peer through the hole in the wall see the following scene:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A human knight with a thick mustache and a look of surprise on his face was apparently thrown backward through the jagged hole and now hangs in the air amid the debris. The knight wears a helm adorned with feathery wings, and he is holding a longsword and a shield.
^402

Nothing of value remains in the study.

Any hags of the Hourglass Coven who retreated to the palace are found here, near the hole in the wall (see appendix B for the hags' stat blocks). Parked nearby are their mounts and vehicles:

- Bavlorna's [bobbing lily pad](/compendium/items/bobbing-lily-pad-wbtw.md) (see appendix A)
- Skabatha's [flying rocking horse](/compendium/bestiary/construct/flying-rocking-horse-wbtw.md) (see chapter 3)
- Endelyn's [ornithopter of flying](/compendium/items/ornithopter-of-flying-wbtw.md) (see appendix A)

If only one hag is present, she is muttering to herself. If two hags are here, they are bickering about what to do next. If all three hags are present, they are mocking the helmed knight as they avoid talking about their present troubles. "He seems to be taking his present situation rather lightly," says Skabatha. "Time has been rather cruel to him," gloats Endelyn. "If we still had the unicorn horn, we could make him plunge to his doom," bemoans Bavlorna.

If [Endelyn Moongrave](/compendium/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md) is encountered here, she tells the characters that she foresaw the dissolution of the coven. If one or both of her sisters are in earshot when she says this, they accuse Endelyn of orchestrating the coven's breakup. Arguing ensues, ending with each hag using her [plane shift](/compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) spell to flee Prismeer. The hags also use this spell to escape if the characters attack them.

Otherwise, the hags do what they do best: deceive and bargain. They claim to be the true heroes of the situation, since they trapped Iggwilv in time to save Prismeer from her tyranny and debauchery. They relate memories of Iggwilv's past, portraying her as a demented archmage who peered into the Abyss, studied it intently to learn how to summon and control demons, and used them to ravage kingdoms on the Material Plane. The hags suggest that the characters focus their efforts on slaying the jabberwock. In exchange, the hags promise to use the power of [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) for the characters' benefit, further tempting them by describing the cauldron's many beneficial properties (see appendix A). The hags hope to buy time until they can turn the tables on the characters and make them suffer for their insolence.

##### Leader of Valor's Call

The helmed knight, named [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md) (see appendix B), battled [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md) and [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) in this study. [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) used a [horn of blasting](/compendium/items/horn-of-blasting.md) to punch a hole in the wall and sent the knight hurtling through it. An instant later, the palace was frozen in time. The horn was destroyed in the blast, which also dealt damage to [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) and [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md). (Those two were later released from temporal stasis by the Hourglass Coven and allowed to rest and regain their lost hit points.) [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md) is suspended 30 feet north of the tower and 60 feet above the storm vortex (area P13). He has 20 hit points remaining.

If [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md)'s temporal stasis ends while he's suspended over the storm vortex, he falls into the vortex. A character within reach of [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md) can try to catch him as he falls, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Alternatively, characters who can fly could reach [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md) while he's frozen in the air, tie one end of a rope around him, and secure the other end to something or someone strong enough to bear his weight (240 pounds with all his gear), thus preventing him from falling when the temporal stasis ends.

If rescued and questioned, [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md) explains his role in leading Valor's Call to the palace (see "Fall of the Witch Queen" earlier in the chapter). He planned to bring the members of the League of Malevolence to justice, but he underestimated their tenacity and resourcefulness. He is grateful to his rescuers and offers to help them accomplish whatever goals brought them to Prismeer. Other members of Valor's Call follow his lead.

##### Stairs Up and Down

Stairs to either side of the hole in the wall lead down to area P31 and up to area P49.

##### Treasure

[Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md) wields [Steel](/compendium/items/steel-wbtw.md), a magic longsword (see appendix A). The sentient blade can't be removed from the knight's hand while he's frozen in time, and it can't communicate or be used to cast [revivify](/compendium/spells/revivify.md) until it is released from temporal stasis.

#### P48. Turrets

These seven turrets, areas P48a through P48g, are attached to the palace's central tower. None of these areas have windows. The contents of the seven turrets are as follows:

- **P48a.** An enameled blue coffer rests on an alabaster pedestal in the middle of this room, which is connected by an open archway to a staircase that leads down to area P31 and up to areas P47 and P49. The coffer contains a plum-sized jewel made of transparent blue crystal with a tiny, Z-shaped crack in its core (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to be treated as a queen and rule over lesser beings.
- **P48b.** Characters can reach this chamber by climbing a staircase from area Pl4b on the palace's lower level. An enameled white coffer rests on a black basalt pedestal in the middle of the room. The coffer contains a plum-sized jewel made of translucent white crystal. The jewel is warm to the touch (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to show kindness to the destitute and unfortunate.
- **P48c.** Characters can reach this chamber by climbing a short staircase from area P48d. An enameled red coffer rests on a pedestal of rotting wood in the middle of the room. The coffer contains a plum-sized jewel made of red crystal that hums faintly (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to punish those who have wronged or defied her.
- **P48d.** This chamber is empty. A short staircase leads up to area P48c. A longer staircase leads down to a hallway on the palace's lower level that connects with areas P14d and P16.
- **P48e.** Characters can reach this chamber by climbing a staircase from a hallway on the palace's lower level that stretches north of area P29. An enameled green coffer rests on a wrought-iron pedestal in the middle of the room. The coffer contains a faintly glowing, plum-sized jewel of green crystal (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to remain hidden from her enemies.
- **P48f.** Characters can reach this chamber by climbing a short staircase from area P48g. An enameled black coffer rests on a pedestal of living vines in the middle of the room. The coffer contains a plum-sized jewel made of lustrous black crystal (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to know what her enemies are plotting.
- **P48g.** This chamber is empty. A short staircase leads up to area P48f. A longer staircase leads down to area P14a on the palace's lower level.

##### Treasure

The five jewels stored in the turrets are Zybilna's crystallized desires. They appeared to her shortly after the domain of Prismeer was formed, and she placed them in the turrets for safekeeping. A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around each jewel.

An [identify](/compendium/spells/identify.md) spell or similar magic reveals that each jewel has a single [conjure fey](/compendium/spells/conjure-fey.md) spell embedded in it, and that the spell can be cast as an action by knocking the jewel three times against a hard object or surface. No other components are required to cast the spell, and there's no way for the user to know what creature will appear. The creature summoned by a jewel depends on the jewel's color, as noted in the Conjured Fey table. The jewel vanishes when the creature appears, and the creature disappears after 1 hour. See the [conjure fey](/compendium/spells/conjure-fey.md) spell description for the creature's behavior.

These conjured Fey are magically created duplicates of creatures whose life essence Zybilna harvested to twist part of the Feywild into what would become her Domain of Delight. Being mere echoes, they are oblivious to this fact and unaware of what they truly are. Each one acts as though it has been imprisoned in its jewel for an unknown period of time (by whom, it can't say). It doesn't realize that it will cease to exist when the spell that brought it forth ends.

**Conjured Fey**

| Jewel | Creature |
|-------|----------|
| Black | Spymaster Hushknife, a [darkling elder](/compendium/bestiary/fey/darkling-elder-mpmm.md) (see appendix C) |
| Blue | Allegra, a [quickling](/compendium/bestiary/fey/quickling-mpmm.md) (see appendix C) |
| Green | Frogspittle, a [green hag](/compendium/bestiary/fey/green-hag.md) |
| Red | Sinch the Ruthless, a [redcap](/compendium/bestiary/fey/redcap-mpmm.md) (see appendix C) |
| White | Winky, a one-eyed [blink dog](/compendium/bestiary/fey/blink-dog.md) |
^conjured-fey

#### P49. Black Book

The door to this chamber is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls, floor, and ceiling of this room are made of white marble tiles. In the middle of the room, a quill with a feather sheathed in flame and a black-covered book rest on an iron lectern.
^409

The book and the quill radiate auras of abjuration magic if scrutinized using a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar magic. The flame coming off the feather is illusory and harmless.

The front cover of the book is embossed with images of a lion and a hart, the two animals rearing up on their hind legs and facing each other. Any creature whose name is written in the book using the quill can open any of the palace's crown locks. If a creature's name is crossed out using the quill, or the page bearing its name is torn from the book, the creature's ability to open these locks is rescinded.

A long list of names fills the book's pages, many of them belonging to fairies, judging by their colorfulness. The hags of the Hourglass Coven are listed near the middle of the book. Other names in the book include [Thinnings](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thinnings-wbtw.md) (Zybilna's butler), Shon (Zybilna's librarian), Kalimanzaros (Zybilna's clerk), and [Raezil](/compendium/bestiary/npc/raezil-wbtw.md) Uthemar (Zybilna's elf spy in area P31). The final few names are written in [Endelyn Moongrave](/compendium/bestiary/npc/endelyn-moongrave-wbtw.md)'s handwriting. These last entries are the members of the League of Malevolence: [Kelek](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kelek-wbtw.md), [Zarak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zarak-wbtw.md), [Zargash](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zargash-wbtw.md), [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md), and [Skylla](/compendium/bestiary/npc/skylla-wbtw.md).

#### P50. Vault

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An ornate iron door stands at the top of the staircase. Its surface is covered with a complex array of cogs, latches, and tumblers. The round doorknob is engraved with the image of a nightingale.
^40b

Zybilna stores her greatest treasures inside this vault, which is shielded against divination magic. The door is impervious to damage and has eight built-in locking mechanisms, any one of which can be affected by a [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic. A character can also spend 1 minute trying to pick one of the locks by using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check. Opening a single lock, however, causes any previously opened locks to close. To enter the vault, all eight locks must be opened at the same time.

Characters who examine the doorknob discover an inscription around its base that reads, "Speak My Name." A creature that speaks the password "Natasha" while grasping the doorknob can open all of the locks simultaneously. The door, once opened, locks automatically when it is closed again. A similar doorknob, but without the inscription, is inside the vault.

The jars of time (area P44) and the costume room (area P36) can provide hints about Zybilna's earliest identity. The solution to this riddle is also hidden in the border of the Witchlight Carnival poster map, which incorporates drawings of creatures and objects pointing at one another: a nilbog (goblin jester) points its scepter at an almiraj (a horned rabbit), which points its horn at a treant, which points to an arrow that points toward a swan, whose beak points to a hippogriff pointing at an axe. By taking the first letters of these creatures and objects, the name NATASHA is spelled out. Reward any player who figures this out by having that player's character whisper the name as if conjuring it from some half-forgotten childhood dream.

When the door opens, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The door swings open to reveal a circular chamber illuminated by drifting balls of colored light. In the middle of the room, a finely forged greatsword floats, point upward, three feet above a treasure chest. The magic that holds the sword aloft also rotates it slowly, so that the blade catches and reflects the multicolored lights.
^40c

The chest is not locked. The drifting balls of light are harmless magical effects confined to this room.

##### Treasure

The greatsword is [Snicker-Snack](/compendium/items/snicker-snack-wbtw.md) (see appendix A). The levitation effect that keeps it aloft ends when the sword is held or moved.

The chest contains the following items:

- [Snicker-Snack](/compendium/items/snicker-snack-wbtw.md)'s ornate scabbard, adorned with phoenix feathers (100 gp)
- A gold helmet decorated with hart antlers (250 gp)
- A shimmering silver cloak, with a unicorn embroidered on it in platinum thread (750 gp)

#### P51. Beanstalk Tower

To enter this tower, the characters must use flight or climb the beanstalk that supports it (see area P17).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The interior of the tower is a mess of broken furniture and grasping vines. Amid the ruins, a toad wearing a tiny wizard's cape perches on the lid of a treasure chest that has slid into a wall and become surrounded by junk.
^40f

The toad is Iggrik, a shapechanged [quasit](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) and Iggwilv's longtime companion. It addresses the characters in Common and claims to be Zybilna's toad familiar. If attacked, it assumes the form of a bat and flies away, taking refuge in the garden (area P2).

When the palace was frozen in time, Iggrik was in the library (area P28). It spied on the Hourglass Coven until the hags left the palace, then used a potion from Zybilna's laboratory to cause the beanstalk to lift this tower into the air, creating a haven for itself. The quasit has been hiding ever since. It knows that the League of Malevolence has sided with the hags against Zybilna, but it lacks the courage to venture forth and remain abreast of the league's activities in the palace. [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md), in particular, terrifies the quasit.

If the characters mention Iggwilv or Natasha, Iggrik tries to redirect the conversation. If the characters are otherwise fishing for information, Iggrik reveals the following helpful tidbits:

- The vault (area P50) contains a vorpal sword that can slay the jabberwock. Zybilna acquired the sword as a precaution, in case the jabberwock turned against her. (If the characters ask about the vault's defenses, Iggrik describes a locked door that requires a password, which he knows but won't automatically divulge.)
- The jabberwock is not the biggest creature living in the palace. That would be Zybilna's enormous owl, Bloodybeak. It hates the jabberwock but is confined to the aviary (area P20) and frozen in time. The password to open the aviary's windows is "canzus."
- Guests can bypass the crown locks on the palace doors by writing their names into Zybilna's black book (in area P49).

Iggrik also knows how to end the curse that Iggwilv placed on the [Ioun stone](/compendium/items/ioun-stone-insight.md) in area P33. If the characters need help ending the curse, Iggrik tells them how if they correctly answer the following riddle: "Yesterday comes after tomorrow, but where's my proof?" The answer is "in a dictionary."

If the characters tell Iggrik that Zybilna can be freed from temporal stasis by speaking her true name while touching her with a unicorn horn, the quasit reveals that Zybilna's true name is Natasha (see also "Unicorn Horn" below).

If Iggrik learns that everyone in the palace can be released from temporal stasis by destroying [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md), the quasit shares the following information:

- A flame tongue weapon can destroy the cauldron, and [Warduke](/compendium/bestiary/npc/warduke-wbtw.md) happens to wield such a weapon.
- The jabberwock likes to coil around the cauldron when it sleeps and is attracted to music. The best chance of defeating it is to use [Snicker-Snack](/compendium/items/snicker-snack-wbtw.md), the vorpal sword in Iggwilv's vault (area P50). The password to unlock the vault is "Natasha."
- Destroying the cauldron is no great loss, since Iggwilv has the power to repair it. (That's not to say that the Witch Queen will be pleased to see her cauldron destroyed.)

##### Treasure

The treasure chest contains a pair of [winged boots](/compendium/items/winged-boots.md), which Iggrik offers to the characters if they promise to free Zybilna.

##### Unicorn Horn

If the Story Tracker indicates that the unicorn horn is here, Iggrik found the horn and placed it in the chest with the [winged boots](/compendium/items/winged-boots.md). Once Iggrik learns that the horn has the power to release creatures trapped in temporal stasis, the quasit offers the horn to characters who promise to use it to free its mistress.

## Ending the Story

Releasing Zybilna from temporal stasis can be accomplished in one of three ways:

- Shattering [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) with a frost brand or flame tongue weapon (see the cauldron's description in appendix A for details), which ends the time-freezing magic throughout the palace.
- Touching [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) with a unicorn horn while reciting a poem called "The Witch Queen's Cauldron" (see area P22), which also ends the time-freezing magic throughout the palace.
- Touching Zybilna with a unicorn horn while speaking her true name, Natasha, which can be learned in the palace's costume room (area P36), from Iggrik the quasit (see area P51), or from the family tree in Loomlurch (see area L11 in chapter 3). Once she is freed, Zybilna can use the horn, the poem, and the cauldron to break the spell on the rest of the palace, as described in area P22.

### Zybilna Comes Alive

If Zybilna is freed from temporal stasis, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Once more able to move, Zybilna lurches forward a step, then quickly regains her balance.
> 
> "Damn. Too late!" she says with a snarl.
> 
> Her eyes dart around in search of enemies before fixing on you. "Have we met?" she asks.
^414

[Iggwilv the Witch Queen](/compendium/bestiary/npc/iggwilv-the-witch-queen-wbtw.md) (see the accompanying stat block) gives the characters time to explain themselves, hanging on their every word. If you used the Warlock's Quest adventure hook and one or more characters have childhood memories of Zybilna, it dawns on Iggwilv that she has met those characters before and gives them a knowing look.

Zybilna/Iggwilv is troubled to learn of what has happened to Prismeer and vows to undo the damage the Hourglass Coven has wrought—a task that will take considerable time and effort. If the characters have unfinished business with the Hourglass Coven, the archfey reveals to them the weaknesses of all three hags and allows the characters to deal with the coven as they see fit (see "Fate of the Hourglass Coven" below). Appendix D has additional roleplaying notes for Zybilna.

#### Things Best Left Unsaid

If the characters speak to Zybilna/Iggwilv about her past, her mood suddenly darkens:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The archfey's hair turns from white to raven-black, and she appears younger and angrier now than she was a moment ago. "You know nothing about my past!" she snaps. "The wars I've won, the enemies I've crushed. I've turned the hourglass on its end so many times. Each turn is a new beginning. Who are you that stands before me and speaks of things best unspoken?"
^416

Ask the players in turn what, if anything, their characters try to do to quell the archfey's anger, then have the characters make a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) group check. Add 1 to the DC for each dretch in area P37 that the characters killed. Any characters who deliberately stoke her anger, or who say or do nothing, automatically get failures on their checks.

On a successful group check, Zybilna/Iggwilv apologizes for her outburst, and her mood lightens. On a failed group check, the archfey erases all knowledge of Iggwilv and Natasha from the characters' memories before continuing the conversation as if nothing had happened. Inform the players that this effect has occurred—the names Iggwilv and Natasha no longer mean anything to their characters, and their characters are unaware of what Zybilna has just done. As far as the characters are concerned, Zybilna is the archfey who rules Prismeer and has no other past identities. The effect is permanent and irreversible.

Various loose ends are addressed in the sections that follow. Some of the events described in these sections require the characters' involvement, while others can play out in their absence.

#### Fate of the Hourglass Coven

If all three hags of the Hourglass Coven are dead, there's nothing more to be done with them. This section discusses what happens next if Zybilna is set free and at least one of the hags is still alive.

The surviving hags can sense when Zybilna is released from temporal stasis—or, rather, they can sense when their hold over Prismeer is lost. The instant Zybilna regains control of her domain, the hags use their [plane shift](/compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) spells to flee to Gehenna, where they maintain a cramped tower guarded by yugoloth mercenaries. They don't think that Zybilna is aware of the tower, but her spies learned about it some time ago. She reveals the tower's location to characters who want to conclude their dealings with the hags or perhaps put an end to them. The tower in Gehenna is beyond the scope of this adventure; flesh out its occupants and defenses as you see fit if the characters decide to pay the hags a visit.

Zybilna takes no immediate action against the surviving hags, preferring to let them stew in exile. If all three hags are still alive, the coven stays together even though its members constantly blame one another for their failures. The hags are united by their fear of Zybilna's wrath, and they live in torment, dreading the day when Zybilna seeks them out and inflicts punishment on them for their wickedness.

#### Valor's Call and the League of Malevolence

The heroes of Valor's Call become distressed if they learn that Zybilna and Iggwilv are one and the same. They know Iggwilv only by her reputation as a villain, but they have allied with Zybilna against the League of Malevolence. That alliance persists, at least until the league is destroyed and its surviving members taken into custody. Zybilna offers to send Valor's Call and their prisoners back to the Material Plane, after which Valor's Call and Iggwilv go their separate ways.

League members who are still at large in the palace try to flee as soon as the time-freezing magic on the palace ends, for they know Zybilna will not forgive them for their treachery. If the characters rescued [Strongheart](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strongheart-wbtw.md), the merciful knight sets out to track down and capture the remaining members of the league, whereas the other members of Valor's Call would just as soon dispose of them. If you want to use the League of Malevolence in future adventures, allowing one or more of its members to escape means they can show up again later in your campaign. The league might also have other members whom the characters have yet to encounter.

#### Stolen Treasures

In accordance with the rule of ownership (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2), Zybilna won't allow characters to keep [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) or the vorpal sword, [Snicker-Snack](/compendium/items/snicker-snack-wbtw.md). The characters can keep any other treasures they acquired in her domain, but only because she chooses to bequeath these items to them.

#### Lost Children

As beings of unfettered emotion and potential, children are of great importance to Zybilna. The archfey sees to it that any children held captive by the Hourglass Coven are liberated, rid of unhappy memories, and escorted back to their homes by pixie courtiers. The same holds true for any children who were sequestered by Zybilna's protective magic (see "Children of Prismeer" in chapter 2).

#### Madryck's Reward

If you used the "Warlock's Quest" adventure hook, the characters might want to contact their employer, Madryck Roslof, and let him know that Zybilna is well. If she is asked, Zybilna is willing to convey a message to Madryck so that the characters don't have to rush home with the news.

Characters who waste no time getting back to Madryck find him safe at home, still clinging to life. Madryck upholds his end of the agreement by giving them the key and the directions to his buried hoard (see "Madryck's Treasure" in the introduction).

### Zybilna's Gifts

Honoring the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2), Zybilna offers her rescuers a gift. The nature of this gift depends on whether or not the characters destroyed her magnificent cauldron.

#### The Cauldron Was Destroyed

If [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) was destroyed but all its pieces are recovered, Zybilna uses a [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell to repair the artifact. If this turn of events occurs, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Zybilna beholds the pieces of the cauldron and says, "I wish my cauldron were made whole again." Motes of colored light swirl around the fragments as they rise into the air and snap together like pieces of a puzzle. The cracks and seams between them gradually vanish as the cauldron is restored. Zybilna puts one hand on its lip, and the cauldron transforms before your eyes. Dull iron turns to gleaming gold, and what was once a fearsome sight to behold now looks wondrous beyond compare.
^41e

The archfey commands her pixie courtiers to bring enough water and wine to put the gold cauldron to use; Zybilna uses that time to attune to the cauldron so that she can exercise its magical properties for the characters' benefit. See appendix A for information about what [Iggwilv's Cauldron](/compendium/items/iggwilvs-cauldron-wbtw.md) can do in its gold form.

##### Dead Dretches

If the characters slew three or more of the [dretches](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/dretch.md) in area P37, Zybilna is not feeling so generous. She uses the [scrying](/compendium/spells/scrying.md) property of the gold cauldron for the characters' benefit only once before sending them away.

#### The Cauldron Was Saved

If her cauldron was not destroyed, Zybilna offers her rescuers the use of a [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell in return for their accomplishments:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "As a reward, I offer you one free casting of a _wish_ spell. Tell me, what is your hearts' desire?"
^422

Zybilna honors the spirit of the characters' request and doesn't try to twist their words. If the characters want to be returned to their home world, Zybilna uses a [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell to transport them back to the Witchlight Carnival or wherever else they want to go, wiser and perhaps not a day older than when they entered the Feywild. If they wish for something else, Zybilna satisfies that desire as well as she can, given the limits of the spell.

If Zybilna can provide what the characters desire without casting a [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell, so much the better. For example, if they want to take her flying coach (in area P11) and explore more of the Feywild, she gives them the coach and its key before seeing them on their merry way. If they ask for her cauldron, she laughs and says, "Not in this lifetime."

##### Dead Dretches

If the characters slew three or more of the dretches in area P37, Zybilna is not feeling so generous. She grants the characters' wish to return home, but nothing else.

#### To Be Young Again!

If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook and the characters are granted a wish, Zybilna offers to harness the time-dilating power of the Feywild to send the characters back to their home plane as the children they once were, so that they can live their lives over without having suffered the terrible losses that brought them to Prismeer in the first place. (This use of Zybilna's gift tests the boundary of what a [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell can do but is nevertheless within the archfey's power.) This choice is a fine option if the players want to "retire" their characters and end the campaign here and now. If all the players accept this option, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You close your eyes, and the world shifts around you. The music of a calliope draws you back to reality. The cool evening air is filled with the sweet smell of candy and the fragrances of autumn. You and your childhood friends skip down the path toward the Witchlight Carnival, clutching golden tickets in your little hands.

The adventure ends here, right where it started.
