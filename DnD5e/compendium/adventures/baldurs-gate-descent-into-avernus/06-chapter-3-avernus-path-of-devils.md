*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus, p. 106* 

## Demon Zapper

_The purest of souls lures fiends into a hellish trap. Zap! Zap_!

—The Cartographer

When the characters approach this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Radiant light cascades from a rusted metal monument shaped like the upraised mandibles of a giant beetle.
^231

The light cascades from a [unicorn](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) named Mooncolor, who is trapped inside a 10-foot-diameter sphere of magical force that prevents any matter from passing into it and blocks any spells cast into or out of it. The sphere is suspended between the zapper's spines, 50 feet above the ground. This light lures demons like moths to a flame, annihilating them when they get close. While trapped in the sphere, the unicorn can't use any of its magical abilities.

The sphere targets the nearest fiend that moves within 100 feet of it, discharging a beam of radiance that forms a line 5 feet wide and up to 100 feet long, extending to the target. Any creature in the line that has 100 hit points or fewer disintegrates into a pile of ash. Creatures with more than 100 hit points in the line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 260 (40d12) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the demon zapper has fired, it must recharge for 1 minute before it can fire again.

To free the unicorn, the characters must destroy the rusted metal structure around it, which has AC 14, 250 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The structure crumbles when it drops to 0 hit points, causing the sphere of force to slowly sink to the ground and fade away. If the characters free the unicorn, it accompanies them if they are of mostly good alignment.

### Ralzala the Dao

A [dao](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/dao.md) named Ralzala defends the demon zapper. Ralzala swore loyalty to Zariel to gain revenge against a rival dao who tried to ruin her. The dao regrets the arrangement and wants to break her pact with the archdevil.

Ralzala hides under the ground at the base of the zapper. If the characters damage the zapper, Ralzala emerges from the ground, casts [tongues](/compendium/spells/tongues.md), and offers them a deal. She reveals that the deposed archdevil [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) would gladly aid the characters in overthrowing [Zariel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/archduke-zariel-of-avernus-bgdia.md). If the characters help Ralzala break her pact with Zariel, the dao promises to direct them to [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s Forge and write them a letter of introduction.

Ralzala knows an oracle named Red Ruth, who could surely divine a solution to her problem. Being bound to the demon zapper, Ralzala is unable to seek out this oracle herself, but the characters could do so in her stead. She tells them to speak with Red Ruth in the corrupted forest nearby and follow her instructions to break the pact. This leads the players to the Bone Brambles.

## Bone Brambles

_Your future is written in your blood. She'll open your veins to paint the story hidden in your heart_.

—The Cartographer

When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A maze of warped trees and bonelike vines stretches before you. Calcified corpses merge with the trees, covered in fungal pods that feed on the blood oozing through the undergrowth. Here and there, narrow paths wend deeper into the wood.
^234

In a bygone age, the night hag Red Ruth corrupted a community of dryads by fouling the roots of their trees with mind-bending poison. As the dryads fell to evil, their forest was wrenched from the Feywild into Avernus. Those dryads who resisted the poison died trying to merge back into their trees. The rest crumbled to ash and became restless, tortured spirits akin to banshees. Contented, Red Ruth made her home at the heart of the twisted wood.

The characters can venture into the wood out of curiosity or to find the oracle that Ralzala hopes can break her pact with Zariel.

### Encounters in the Brambles

The following descriptions correspond to areas marked on map 3.4.

#### B1. Entrances

Characters who circle the tangled stretch of woodland uncover five separate paths leading into its interior. Impassable brambles choke the woodland outside these trails and even grow overhead to blot out the sky.

To avoid getting lost in the wood, the characters must succeed on a DC 15 group Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. On a success, the characters locate Red Ruth's lair at the heart of the woodland (area B3). If they fail, they blunder into one of the dead ends listed below (area B2) and must make the check again when they move on. Once all four dead ends have been explored, the group automatically locates Red Ruth's lair.

#### B2. Dead Ends

If the characters get lost in the brambles, roll on the Dead Ends table to determine where they end up, or choose a result that they haven't encountered yet.

**Dead Ends**

| dice: d4 | Dead End |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | Dead traveler |
| 2 | Dryad spirits |
| 3 | Shambling mounds |
| 4 | Thorn trap |
^dead-ends

##### Dead Traveler

The corpse of a drow rests at the end of the path, her flesh impaled by hungry vines and her face twisted in an expression of horror. The traveler wears a [bag of devouring](/compendium/items/bag-of-devouring.md) on a strap.

##### Dryad Spirits

Three cursed dryad spirits (use the [banshee](/compendium/bestiary/undead/banshee.md) stat block to represent them) approach the characters and demand to be reminded of the "wonders of life." At your discretion, a character can mollify the spirits with a sweet story, a kiss, a song, or anything else that reminds the dryads of home. If the characters fail to satisfy them, the three spirits attack.

##### Shambling Mounds

Three [shambling mounds](/compendium/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) arise from the brambles and attack the characters.

##### Thorn Trap

The characters spot a hawthorn staff entangled at the end of the path, buried behind a 15-foot-deep thicket of thorns. Each 5-foot-square section of thorns counts as difficult terrain and has AC 11, 15 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. If damaged but not destroyed, the thorns magically regrow to full health after 24 hours. The thorns restrain any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of them. Any creature that starts its turn [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the thorns takes 22 (4d10) slashing damage from the writhing barbs. Once a creature is entangled, it can break free only if all the thorn bushes within 5 feet of it are destroyed.

The staff at the center of the maze is a decoy and crumbles to ashes in the hands of whoever claims it.

#### B3. Red Ruth's Lair

When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A cave-like hovel lies at the center of the maze. Hundreds of bones and body parts hang by twine from the entrance, and the ceiling is strung with garland made of bloody entrails. The air buzzes with flies.
^23d

Red Ruth, a [night hag](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md), makes her lair inside this gory den. She wears a dress made from stitched-together bones. Strings of infants' skulls hang around her neck and chatter nursery rhymes incessantly (and in different languages) as she talks.

Evil visitors from all over the multiverse travel to Avernus to hear Red Ruth's divinations and sample her mystical brews. If the characters talk to Red Ruth about the dao's curse, she offers them a deal for her assistance (see "Hold the Fort" below).

Red Ruth sells potions brewed from blood, which she gladly trades for [soul coins](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md) as listed on the Red Ruth's Bargains table. Each potion imparts an unpleasant but harmless side effect when imbibed: flatulence, boils, hair loss, or any other ghastliness you can conceive. Her divinations replicate the effects of a [commune](/compendium/spells/commune.md) spell, although Red Ruth provides the answers to the questions without needing to appeal to a divine being.

**Red Ruth's Bargains**

| Goods | Price |
|-------|-------|
| Potion, common or uncommon | 1 [soul coin](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md) |
| Potion, rare | 2 [soul coins](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md) |
| [Commune](/compendium/spells/commune.md) spell | 3 [soul coins](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md) |
^red-ruths-bargains

### Hold the Fort

Red Ruth says she knows how to free Ralzala the dao from her pact, but she won't tell the characters until they've performed a favor for her first. The hag explains that she's long overdue for her bath—it's been a couple of centuries at the very least since she last washed. She asks the characters to arrange and pay for a pampering session at Infernal Rapture in the Wandering Emporium. She warns the characters of one other condition before they decide: they must watch over her grove while she's gone. If the characters attack or threaten Red Ruth during this negotiation, she simply slips away into the Ethereal Plane and doesn't return until they leave.

The night hag can divine the location of the Wandering Emporium by spilling some of her own blood on the ground and studying the pattern that the blood makes. Red Ruth can then point to a location on the character's map of Avernus. (The location can be anywhere you choose.) When the characters arrive at that location, they encounter the Wandering Emporium just as the night hag predicted. Although Red Ruth knows that the owner of Infernal Rapture is a rakshasa, she doesn't share this information with the characters, expecting them to figure it out on their own.

Characters who return from the Wandering Emporium with confirmation of Red Ruth's appointment must watch over the grove for a few hours while the hag leaves to take her bath. During this time, the cursed spirits of the dryads arise to destroy Red Ruth's lair as punishment for her crimes. This force consists of two dryad spirits (use the [banshee](/compendium/bestiary/undead/banshee.md) stat block) and a walking, [undead tree](/compendium/bestiary/undead/undead-tree-bgdia.md) (use the [treant](/compendium/bestiary/plant/treant.md) stat block, except the tree is undead and has resistance to necrotic damage).

If the characters defeat the undead, Red Ruth fulfills her end of the bargain when she returns. Otherwise, the [undead tree](/compendium/bestiary/undead/undead-tree-bgdia.md) collapses the entrance to Red Ruth's hovel. The night hag is not pleased and uses her Etherealness trait to walk through the collapsed entrance of her cave, disappearing into her lair without so much as a goodbye.

#### Treasure

The dryad spirits have no treasure, but the [undead tree](/compendium/bestiary/undead/undead-tree-bgdia.md) has a dead gnome skeleton lodged in a hollow cavity in its trunk. The skeleton wears a witch's hat (actually a [hat of disguise](/compendium/items/hat-of-disguise.md)) and clutches a [+1 wand of the war mage](/compendium/items/1-wand-of-the-war-mage.md).

#### Development

To honor her end of the deal, Red Ruth reveals that Ralzala must drink the blood of a titan to free herself from Zariel's pact. The night hag says that Uldrak might be able to help but warns "he's not what he used to be." If the characters show her their map, she identifies Uldrak's location. This sends the group to Uldrak's Grave.

## Uldrak's Grave

_A fallen titan or a wimp with delusions of grandeur? I'll leave that for you to decide_.

—The Cartographer

When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The cracked helm and sword of a titan lies half buried in the ash of Avernus. A spherical stone set into the sword's pommel still gleams with scarlet radiance.
^242

The [empyrean](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md) Uldrak quested into the Nine Hells to slay [Tiamat](/compendium/bestiary/npc/tiamat-rot.md) and win glory for his deity, Surtur, but he was beaten handily by the dragon queen. The empyrean wasn't slain; instead, Tiamat cursed him for his impudence by transforming him into a [spined devil](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/spined-devil.md). This wretched creature now hides inside the helmet that he once wore. For millennia, Uldrak has dwelled in this spot, forlornly plotting to restore his true form.

### Dealing with Uldrak

Uldrak is a bitter creature who barely remembers his past. Long ago, he learned how to remove his curse, but the solution was so beyond him that he consigned himself to failure. Now, he's more interested in scrabbling to survive than trying to escape the Nine Hells.

Uldrak's empyrean heritage still lingers in his voice. He understands all languages, and when he speaks, he randomly switches language to Giant. Millennia of isolation have unhinged his mind, so he argues with himself often, even in front of strangers.

Uldrak reveals his sorry tale to any who ask him about the empyrean's whereabouts. Characters who came here to extract Uldrak's blood (see "Bone Brambles," above) can make a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check when they learn that Uldrak is now a fiend. On a success, they hypothesize that the blood must be drawn from his titan form to break the dao's curse. Thankfully, Uldrak has a plan (see "Development" below).

#### Treasure

The sphere set into the pommel of Uldrak's sword is an [orb of dragonkind](/compendium/items/orb-of-dragonkind.md). This item is vital to Uldrak's plan to free himself from his curse.

#### Development

To regain his true form, Uldrak must spill some of Tiamat's blood on the ground of Avernus. Fighting Tiamat in his present form would be madness, but Uldrak has learned that a dragonborn named [Arkhan the Cruel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arkhan-the-cruel-bgdia.md) carries some of Tiamat's blood in a reliquary around his neck. Uldrak reveals that the "gem" glowing on the pommel of his old sword is in fact an [orb of dragonkind](/compendium/items/orb-of-dragonkind.md)—an item sure to be of interest to Arkhan. He urges the characters to trade the orb to Arkhan for the reliquary and then return here. If the characters agree, Uldrak gives them directions to Arkhan's Tower.

## Arkhan's Tower

_He wears the hand of evil, yet his goal remains just beyond his fingertips_.

—The Cartographer

When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A dark tower looms on the horizon, its black spire rising hundreds of feet, its ramparts bristling with charred skulls mounted on iron spikes. The tower's apex splits into five narrower spires that jab at the sky like clawed fingers. Circling above the tower's peak is a great white dragon stained with ash and soot.
> 
> As you get closer to the tower, you notice figures shuffling atop its ramparts—undead guards in various states of decay.
^248

[Arkhan the Cruel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arkhan-the-cruel-bgdia.md) has claimed this tower as his base. Here, with the help of a tortle death-priest of Tiamat named [Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md), the dragonborn warrior researches ways to assert his will over the artifact known as the [Hand of Vecna](/compendium/items/hand-of-vecna.md), so he can use its secrets to free the evil dragon queen Tiamat from the Nine Hells. Arkhan has traveled to a nearby monument to commune with his goddess, leaving [Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md) behind.

Dragons tore the obsidian rocks of Arkhan's tower from the fiery volcanoes of Avernus. Fifty [skeletons](/compendium/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) and thirty [zombies](/compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) stand ready to defend the tower, which is also guarded by the [adult white dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon.md) Obatala. When it detects intruders, the dragon roars to alert [Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md), who emerges from the tower to greet new arrivals. [Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md), whose shell is carved with Draconic runes that spell out prayers to Tiamat, is joined by four [ghouls](/compendium/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) that serve as his assistants. The ghouls gnaw on bones and eye the characters hungrily as [Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md) negotiates with them. Under no circumstances does [Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md) allow intruders to enter the nine-story tower and disturb his experiments or Arkhan's chambers.

[Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md) is willing to lead the characters to Arkhan if they have something valuable in their possession, such as the [orb of dragonkind](/compendium/items/orb-of-dragonkind.md) recovered from Uldrak's Grave or the unicorn rescued from the demon zapper. Otherwise, the tortle instructs the characters to leave at once or die.

In addition to its undead defenses, the tower has four smaller dragons living inside it: a [young black dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-black-dragon.md) named Slarkas, a [young blue dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-blue-dragon.md) named Vistalancer, a [young green dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon.md) named Vermilius, and a [red dragon wyrmling](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling.md) nicknamed Flash. These dragons attack characters who invade the tower and fight to the death to defend it.

### Treasure

[Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md) wields a +1 maul and carries five [potions of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md) and two [soul coins](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md) in a sling bag. The tower is filled with laboratories, morgues, and dragon hatcheries that might contain other treasures protected by magical wards, at your discretion.

### Development

If the characters convince [Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md) to lead them to Arkhan, the tortle guides them safely to the Monument to Tiamat (see "Monument to Tiamat"). The characters could also stake out Arkhan's tower and await the dragonborn's return. Arkhan reacts here as he does at the Monument to Tiamat, except that he can't summon Asojano the chimera.

## Monument to Tiamat

_Draconic devils roost in a giant skull, through which the dragon queen speaks with five tongues_.

—The Cartographer

When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A colossal dragon's skull leans against a mountainside, surrounded by bones the size of houses. Acrid smoke rises from the skull's maw. A military tent has been pitched among the bones, and parked next to it is a two-wheeled infernal war machine.
> 
> Gathered around this tent are a dozen chattering, reptilian humanoids with gleaming swords, white scales, and white, leathery wings.
^24e

A tunnel at the back of the skull leads to Tiamat's lair. The devils nesting within the skull, the abishai, are believed to carry out her bidding—or perhaps guard over her prison on orders of Asmodeus.

From the depths of her lair, Tiamat can hear the prayers and pronouncements of faithful servants who call out to her from the maw of the colossal dragon skull. If the dragon queen chooses to reply, her five hissing voices issue from the darkness, amplified by the skull as they give commands and finish each other's sentences.

It would be madness to assault this location without an army. Abishai of all colors nest in the sulfurous caves behind the skull, and scores of [white abishai](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/white-abishai-mpmm.md) pour forth to counter any assault or invasion.

The infernal war machine parked next to the tent is a {@vehicle Devil's Ride|BGDIA} belonging to [Arkhan the Cruel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arkhan-the-cruel-bgdia.md)'s minotaur bodyguard, [Torogar Steelfist](/compendium/bestiary/npc/torogar-steelfist-bgdia.md).

### Arkhan the Cruel

The dragonborn [Arkhan the Cruel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arkhan-the-cruel-bgdia.md) is in the tent along with his [manticore](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md) companion, Chango, and [Torogar Steelfist](/compendium/bestiary/npc/torogar-steelfist-bgdia.md), his savage minotaur bodyguard. Arkhan visits the monument to commune with his queen and report on his ongoing battle of wills to master the [Hand of Vecna](/compendium/items/hand-of-vecna.md), which came into his possession during a brief excursion to the world of Exandria.

If the characters approach Arkhan's encampment, the twelve [white abishai](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/white-abishai-mpmm.md) at the camp rush forward to intercept them. Characters accompanied by [Krull](/compendium/bestiary/npc/krull-bgdia.md) the tortle (see "Arkhan's Tower") or who have something Arkhan might consider valuable are permitted to approach his camp.

Arkhan believes he can use the [Hand of Vecna](/compendium/items/hand-of-vecna.md) to unlock the means of freeing Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells, but only if the hand doesn't kill him first. The hand is slowly corrupting Arkhan's flesh and decomposing his body on one side. To stave off this decline, Arkhan needs to use the [Hand of Vecna](/compendium/items/hand-of-vecna.md) to snuff the life out of good-aligned creatures. If the characters try to cut a deal with Arkhan—for a vial of Tiamat's blood or help contacting the dragon queen herself—Arkhan demands the sacrifice of a good-aligned creature in exchange. [Lulu](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lulu-bgdia.md) is an ideal candidate, as is the unicorn Mooncolor (see "Demon Zapper"). Sacrificing such a creature to Arkhan is an evil act.

In battle, Arkhan uses [branding smite](/compendium/spells/branding-smite.md) to channel the radiant power of Tiamat into his weapon attacks. If a fight turns against him, he uses the [teleport](/compendium/spells/teleport.md) power of the [Hand of Vecna](/compendium/items/hand-of-vecna.md) to return to his tower with as many allies as possible. Should one or more of his comrades fall in battle, Arkhan uses [revivify](/compendium/spells/revivify.md) and [raise dead](/compendium/spells/raise-dead.md) spells to bring them back to life as soon as possible.

If Arkhan finds himself overwhelmed with opposition, he orders the abishai to attack. Arkhan can also use a bonus action to call forth Asojano, a [chimera](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/chimera.md) lairing in the depths of the colossal dragon skull. This evil monster in the service of Tiamat considers Arkhan a friend and ally.

#### Development

The characters most likely come here to bargain with Arkhan for a vial of Tiamat's blood in his possession. If they acquire this reliquary, they can return Tiamat's blood to Uldrak and use it to break his curse. Uldrak excitedly splashes the vial's hissing contents onto the ground at his feet. Moments later, he sheds his fiendish skin and grows back into his true form, that of a lawful evil [empyrean](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md). Laughing gleefully, Uldrak yanks his sword from the ground and gladly provides the characters with a gallon of his blood so they can break the curse on Ralzala. When this is done, he casts [plane shift](/compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) to return to the realm of his deity, Surtur.

Returning to the demon zapper, the characters find that Ralzala also honors her word. After gulping down the empyrean's blood to free herself from her pact, she etches her letter of introduction to [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) onto a basalt tablet and directs the characters to his volcanic lair. The adventure continues in [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s Forge.

## Bel's Forge

_An ousted archduke sulking in a volcano, eager to reclaim his stolen throne_.

—The Cartographer

When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A gargantuan volcano dominates the horizon. Clouds of fire and ash spew from its caldera, and the air trembles with its angry grumblings. A vast, multilayered fortress has been hewn into the volcano's rocky slopes.
^252

[Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md), one of the Nine Hells' greatest military minds, dwells in this iron keep. From this bastion, Zariel's second-in-command and the former lord of Avernus oversees the forges that furnish weapons and armor for the Blood War.

An army of devils guards [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s fortress, and his dark magic alerts him to intruders within its walls. Strangers who venture too close are assaulted by a strike team of two [horned devils](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) leading ten [bearded devils](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md). If the intruders survive and linger in the area, a whole army of devils descends upon them.

Characters can gain an audience with [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) if they have a letter of introduction (available from the dao Ralzala), or if they're captured or killed by [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s forces. [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) delights in raising his enemies from the dead to interrogate them, especially if they appear to be outlanders. Infiltrating [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s fortress is possible, but only if the characters have magical means of shielding themselves from his divinations. If they befriend Olanthius (see "Crypt of the Hellriders"), cut a new deal with Red Ruth (see "Bone Brambles"), or perform a quest for Mephistopheles (see "Mirror of Mephistar"), they could feasibly infiltrate [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s fortress by smuggling themselves in with any tribute their ally brings before [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md). Whether the characters smuggle themselves inside, arrive with a letter of introduction, or get taken into custody, they eventually arrive at the lowest level of [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s fortress, where [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) lairs.

### Forge Features

[Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s forge is carved out of volcanic rock and has soaring, 50-foot-high ceilings throughout. Other features of the forge are summarized below.

**Heat**. [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s forge is unbearably hot, with an ambient temperature of 130 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. The extreme heat has detrimental effects on creatures not acclimated to such environments (see ""Extreme Heat"" in "chapter 5" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

**Lava**. Open rivers of lava are channeled through the forge to smelt ore and soften metal. Any creature that enters the lava for the first time on its turn or starts its turn in it takes 33 (6d10) fire damage. Increase the damage to 99 (18d10) fire damage if the creature is fully immersed in the lava.

### Encounters in the Forge

The following descriptions correspond to areas marked on map 3.5.

#### F1. Descent to the Forge

Read the following boxed text to the players when their characters reach the lowest level of [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s fortress:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A wrought iron spiral staircase descends into a cavernous forge. Channels of bubbling lava wind through the complex, casting fiery light over huge anvils. Chained giants with coal-black skin and fiery orange hair hammer out weapons under the malignant gaze of a pit fiend seated in a flying throne. Throughout the forge, sparks fall like rain.
^256

The pit fiend is [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) (see "Roleplaying Bel" below). Only he can control his Large flying throne, which has a flying speed of 15 feet and can hover.

#### F2. Fire Giant Blacksmiths

Four [fire giants](/compendium/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) in chains are using enormous hammers and anvils to craft infernal weapons and armor under [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s watchful eye. A clutter of giant-sized objects surround each giant's anvil: iron buckets containing oily water, coils of greasy chain, mounds of iron filings, and more.

The fire giants' names are Drumra, Jalt, Rosska, and Zrakorn. While chained, the giants have a walking speed of 10 feet. The giants despise [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) but are bound by magic to do as he demands. The chains that bind them can't be broken or unlocked except by [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md).

#### F3. Weapons Rack

These racks contain weapons awaiting delivery to the front lines of the Blood War. Most of them are too big for Small or Medium characters to wield effectively.

##### Treasure

Among the larger weapons are three magic weapons sized for Small and Medium characters: a pair of hellfire javelins and a hellfire greatsword.

#### F4. Pool of Magma

Inside this cavern, steel pylons and gantries keep a huge and terrible new machine suspended above a pool of magma. The machine is [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s secret weapon in his cold war to overthrow Zariel. When the characters arrive here, the infernal machine is still under construction and far from complete.

### Roleplaying Bel

[Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) oversees the manufacture of weapons and armor for the Blood War. Though Asmodeus has instructed Zariel to accept [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) as her advisor, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) and Zariel loathe each other and invent distractions to keep them apart. When [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) learns of the characters' intentions, he decides to use them as pawns to tarnish and ultimately overthrow Zariel.

[Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) outwardly plays the role of Zariel's loyal vassal. Secretly, he uses telepathy to hatch a treasonous plot with the characters. [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s plan is as follows:

- [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) wants the characters to retrieve nine adamantine rods that were stolen from his forge by Zariel's spies. Once all nine rods are returned to him, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) is willing to divulge the location of the Bleeding Citadel.
- [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) suggests that the characters speak to a sibriex that was recently captured by his spies. Sibriexes are hoarders of forbidden lore, and this particular one has been a good source of information for [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md). It might know where Zariel's spies hid the adamantine rods.
- To help the characters reach the sibriex, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) offers to provide them with a barge they can use to ply the River Styx.

[Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) doesn't tell the characters that the Companion (what he calls the Solar Insidiator) was built in his forge, nor does he reveal that it has a planetar trapped inside it. [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) also fails to mention that the nine adamantine rods are the keys to unlocking the device and freeing the planetar. If the characters ask what the rods are for, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) says, "That's not really any of your business. This is the best deal you'll get in Avernus. I suggest you take it."

If the characters become belligerent or demanding, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) sighs and snaps his fingers, causing the infernal chains to fall off the fire giants. He promises freedom to any fire giant that kills an intruder, prompting the giants to attack the characters without mercy. [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) then steeples his fingers and watches the battle unfold. In battle, the fire giants hurl buckets, tools, and heavy chains instead of boulders. They also try to shove enemies into channels of molten lava.

If the characters defeat the fire giants, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) commends their victory and offers them the same deal as before. If the characters refuse him a second time, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) smiles and says, "A pity. All those poor people in Elturel were counting on you." He then offers to teleport them out of his fortress, so they can be on their way. Gracious host that [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) is, he won't attack the characters directly unless they attack him first, in which case he casts [imprisonment](/compendium/spells/imprisonment.md) on a party member ([Lulu](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lulu-bgdia.md) being his first choice). If the spell works, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) vows to release his prisoner once the nine adamantine rods are found and returned to him, no questions asked.

#### Development

When the characters are ready to leave his forge, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) teleports them back to the surface. If the characters agreed to [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s terms, an [imp](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) named Balakros is waiting for them when they return to the surface. [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) instructs the imp to help the characters reach the sibriex. The imp has performed this task before and knows, without having to be told, that its orders include reporting back to [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) and whispering everything the sibriex said into its master's ear.

If characters refuse to let Balakros accompany them, the imp bids them farewell, turns [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible), and follows them at a respectful distance.

#### River Travel

Balakros offers to lead the characters to an iron barge moored on the shore of the River Styx. An iron road leads from [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s volcano to the barge, and it's patrolled by [bearded devils](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md) that won't attack the characters as long as Balakros is leading them. Lashed to the sides of the barge are demon skulls and bones. Characters who travel by barge must pass underneath the Stygian Dock on their way to the sibriex.

The barge is 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, and sturdy enough to transport up to two Huge infernal war machines. Twelve [merregons](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/merregon-mpmm.md) under the command of a [bone devil](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) named Krinjak operate the barge's oars. Krinjak's instructions are to take the characters where they need to go. Although it professes loyalty to [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md), Krinjak is secretly a spy for Zariel. After taking the characters as close to the sibriex as the River Styx allows, it flies off to warn Zariel that the characters are working for [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md).

#### Overland Travel

If the characters would rather travel to the sibriex in some other fashion, Balakros the imp offers to serve as their overland guide, since it knows where the sibriex is. It can also point to the sibriex's location on the characters' map of Avernus.

## Sibriex

_A breeder of horrors and a hoarder of secrets, a sibriex is said to be as old as the Abyss_.

—The Cartographer

When the characters arrive at this location, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Spiky chains lash a fifteen-foot-diameter, floating blob of quivering flesh to a 20-foot-tall wrought-iron scaffold. Two fiends wrapped in chains stand atop the scaffold, torturing the bloated creature's flesh by tightening its chains. Demon ichor oozes from its wounds, forming a shallow pool around the scaffolding.
> 
> A third, jackal-headed fiend uses a bronze horn to yell loudly at the bloated prisoner in multiple languages. It sits cross-legged about half-way up the scaffolding.
^260

[Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s fiends captured a [sibriex](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/sibriex-mpmm.md) and have been torturing and interrogating it for quite a long time now. The sibriex is [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by infernal chains from [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s forge that also prevent it from using its spells or actions to escape.

The demon ichor that pools around the scaffolding smells terrible but can be easily avoided. For more information on demon ichor, see "Demon Ichor".

Two [chain devils](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/chain-devil.md) named Shalok and Jank are torturing the sibriex under the guidance of Fetchtatter, a cruel [arcanaloth](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/arcanaloth.md) who signed an infernal contract with [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md), guaranteeing the arcanaloth's loyalty to [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) in exchange for magic items and spellbooks. All three fiends are immune to the sibriex's Warp Creature power.

Fetchtatter uses its speaking horn to address the sibriex, treating it like an idiot child. The arcanaloth's declarations typically begin with, "Tell me everything you know about..." and end with a long pause as it waits for the sibriex to answer. The sibriex has grown increasingly obstinate, much to Fetchtatter's chagrin. The arcanaloth offers three [soul coins](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md) to the characters if they can make the sibriex talk, but it has no intention of honoring this agreement.

### Treasure

Fetchtatter wears a [ring of x-ray vision](/compendium/items/ring-of-x-ray-vision.md) on its right hand. In the pockets of its bile-stained robe are two [potions of greater healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) and six [soul coins](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md). The arcanaloth also carries a grimy spellbook bound in chasme flesh. Fetchtatter's spellbook contains all the spells the arcanaloth has prepared.

### Interrogating the Sibriex

Before it was captured by [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s fiends, the sibriex wandered throughout Avernus, amassing information from every location it visited. At your discretion, the sibriex could have knowledge of other locations shown on the characters' map of Avernus. It gives up what it knows only if the characters use magical methods of interrogation. It doesn't know anything that can help the characters find the [Sword of Zariel](/compendium/items/sword-of-zariel-bgdia.md), but it knows where [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s nine adamantine rods are located.

The sibriex uses its telepathy to contact the first party member who comes within 120 feet of it, offering information in exchange for its freedom. The character with whom the sibriex is speaking telepathically can detect the insincerity of the sibriex's offer with a successful DC 17 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. Contrary to its claim, the sibriex doesn't plan to help the characters.

A character can, with a successful DC 17 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, convince the sibriex to share one bit of useful information as a show of good faith. If asked about the adamantine rods, the sibriex claims to have seen all nine rods in the wreck of a crashed flying fortress. The sibriex won't reveal the wreck's location, but Balakros the imp knows where the wreck is and can lead the characters there if told about it. [Lulu](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lulu-bgdia.md) might also suddenly remember the wreck's location, at your discretion.

### Releasing the Sibriex

Fetchtatter and the chain devils attack characters who try to free the sibriex. Breaking three of the six chains that bind the sibriex allows it to slip free, whereupon it flies into the air and tries to get as far away from the iron scaffold as possible. Each chain has AC 19, 33 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage.

### Flesh Warping

When a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an [abyssal wretch](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/abyssal-wretch-mtf.md), the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.

A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the Flesh Warping table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.

#### Development

After tricking or magically compelling the sibriex to divulge the location of [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s adamantine rods, the characters can set out to recover the rods from the wrecked flying fortress.

## Wrecked Flying Fortress

_A weapon made for an archdevil, ravaged in battle and ripe for plunder_.

—The Cartographer

To reach the wrecked flying fortress, characters must cross a hot, windswept plain wracked by magical fire storms. Flying characters and fast-moving infernal war machines can easily avoid these fire storms.

Characters traveling on foot must succeed on a DC 20 group Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check as they cross the fireswept plain. On a failed check, a fire storm filling a 60-foot cube sweeps across the ground and engulfs as many party members as it can. The storm then attaches itself to one randomly determined party member, staying centered on that creature for 1 minute. At the end of the duration, the storm detaches from that creature and moves off in a random direction. The storm must remain in contact with the ground at all times. If it becomes separated from the creature to which it has attached itself, the storm moves off in a random direction and ceases to endanger the party.

Any character that enters a fire storm for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire storm ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or held. A successful [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (DC 18) cast on the storm causes it to flame out and disappear.

### Arrival at the Wreck

When the characters arrive at the wreck, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A towering wreck rises from the scorched hellscape. It looks like a giant sword blade, tilted to a twenty-degree angle and partly buried underground. Much of its exposed hull is rusted and torn asunder. Hot wind screams as it tears through the hollow structure, and six giant vultures circle high above it.
^269

After demons crippled this fortress in battle, Zariel abandoned it and left it to rust. The fortress is 150 feet tall, but the lower third of it is buried underground. All the lower decks have been picked clean, but the command deck at the top still holds promise. Characters can scale the wreck's torn outer hull to reach this deck, which is 80 feet off the ground at its lowest point. Climbing the outside of the wreck without proper gear requires a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Characters who can fly have no trouble reaching the command deck.

The "giant vultures" circling above the wreck are six [vrocks](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md) that attack anyone who gets within 50 feet of the command deck. If three vrocks are killed, the remaining ones flee and don't return.

### Lower Decks

The lower decks are riddled with holes, allowing easy access to the fortress interior. Characters can ascend to the command deck without needing to make ability checks simply by moving up through the ruins of the lower decks, but the wreckage inside the fortress makes the ascent arduous.

#### Bone Whelks

Bone whelks are large mollusks that excrete an adhesive to attach skulls, bones, and other detritus to their bodies for protection. These slugs scour the wreck for organic matter to feed on, clinging to torn sections of wall, floor, and ceiling while taking shelter from the searing winds and hungry vrocks. Characters who try to make their way up through the interior of the wreck are attacked by five [bone whelks](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/bone-whelk-bgdia.md). Too slow to mount an effective escape, the bone whelks fight to the death.

When a bone whelk dies, it emits a scream that has a 50|50 percent% chance chance of attracting the vrocks, which attack other creatures (including bone whelks) indiscriminately.

#### Soul Intake

Deep inside the wreck is a 5-foot-diameter, cylindrical pipe made of iron that runs almost the full height of the fortress. This pipe was designed to siphon tormented souls from the River Styx, feeding them into a 10-foot-diameter cistern below the command deck to power the fortress. The pipe can be accessed by a hatch on every deck except the command deck. Nesting inside the cistern at the top of the pipe is a monster resembling a 30-foot-long centipede that exudes necrotic sludge. If it hears one of the hatches open, it slinks down the pipe to devour any creatures it sees. This creature uses the [remorhaz](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/remorhaz.md) stat block, with these changes:

- Whenever the monster would deal fire damage, it deals necrotic damage instead.
- It has immunity to necrotic damage instead of cold damage.

### Command Deck Features

The command deck, shown on map 3.6, has the following features:

**Iron Surfaces**. The floor, walls, ceilings, and doors are made of iron that has been twisted, bent, and ruptured in places. Ceilings throughout are 15 feet high.

**Light Sources**. Areas that are exposed to the outdoors are dimly lit by the hellish red sky of Avernus. Beyond that, the only light sources are harmless showers of sparks that periodically rain down from gashes in the ceiling.

**Slant**. Like the rest of the fortress, the command deck leans at a twenty-degree angle, with area W5 being the lowest part of the deck and area W8 being the highest. The sloped metal floor is difficult terrain.

### Command Deck Encounters

The following descriptions correspond to areas marked on map 3.6.

#### W1. Bridge

Unless they've been defeated elsewhere, the six [vrocks](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md) flying above the wreck swoop down to attack characters as they explore this area.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Sparks rain down from gashes in the ceiling of what used to be the bridge, much of which is open to the sky. The room has been picked clean, though rows of stripped-down consoles and a few dangling chains remain.
^270

None of the consoles are operational, though characters can salvage them for wires and other metal components.

##### Development

As the characters explore this location, they hear several loud infernal war machines approaching. Through holes in the wall, they can see three vehicles screaming across the hellscape toward the wreck:

- Two {@vehicle Devil's Ride|BGDIA|Devil's Rides}, one driven by [Chukka](/compendium/bestiary/npc/chukka-bgdia.md) and the other by [Clonk](/compendium/bestiary/npc/clonk-bgdia.md) (see "Chukka and Clonk"). Each kenku carries a small bag containing three [soul coins](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md).
- A {@vehicle Tormentor|BGDIA} crewed by Barnabas the [flameskull](/compendium/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md) (using its [mage hand](/compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) spell to drive) and three [redcaps](/compendium/bestiary/fey/redcap-mpmm.md). Clinging to the vehicle's outer hull are six [madcaps](/compendium/bestiary/fey/redcap-mpmm.md).

[Mad Maggie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mad-maggie-bgdia.md) has sent this force to search the wreck for machine parts and other valuables. The {@vehicle Tormentor|BGDIA} and the {@vehicle Devil's Ride|BGDIA|Devil's Rides} have 12 hours of fuel remaining before they need more [soul coins](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md).

If the characters left one or more infernal war machines parked outside the wrecked fortress, [Chukka](/compendium/bestiary/npc/chukka-bgdia.md) and [Clonk](/compendium/bestiary/npc/clonk-bgdia.md) search those vehicles while Barnabas leads the redcaps and madcaps into the lower decks of the wreck in search of treasure. If the characters left Fort Knucklebone on good terms with [Mad Maggie](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mad-maggie-bgdia.md), the flameskull and the kenku won't give the party too much trouble. However, the madcaps might try to steal one of the characters' infernal war machines or inadvertently release the monster lurking in the soul intake pipe (see "Soul Intake").

#### W2. Alarm Console

Characters can access this room from the deck below by climbing up through a hatch in the floor. They can also enter this room through an iron door. Describe the room to the players as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Jagged gashes in the outer wall allow the hellish sky of Avernus to light this room. An open hatch in the floor leads down to the lower decks, and a metal console is plugged into one wall.
^273

Any character who flips the switches on the console while it's plugged into the wall creates one or more of the following sound effects, which can be heard throughout the wrecked fortress:

- A blaring alarm klaxon
- Loud, discordant instrumental music with screaming vocals
- A soothing, female-sounding voice saying "Aj ta noss iz'lech'iz ta kraj-ka-nok Asmodei das," which is Infernal for, "You are important. Promotion is your destiny. Asmodeus loves you."
- A deep, devilish voice saying "Chy'gwa urnossk!" ("Abandon ship!" in Infernal) over and over

#### W3. Damaged Machinery

Describe this area to the players as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Sparks rain down from torn holes in the ceiling, falling onto a pair of rectangular machines that have been torn from the walls. The machines now stand in the middle of the room, their loose wires sticking out like bad hairdos.
^275

Each machine resembles a metal file cabinet covered with switches and dials that no longer do anything. A character who spends at least 1 hour taking apart a machine can discern its original purpose with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check:

- The larger machine was used to scramble telepathic communications within 1 mile of the fortress.
- The smaller machine could send telepathic transmissions to all devils within 1 mile of the fortress.

#### W4. Records Room

Characters who listen at the iron door to this room hear an inhuman cackling sound beyond. They need [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) or light sources to see into the room.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Crouched on a pile of humanoid bones in the far, lowest corner of this room is a hunched gnoll that looks underfed. It gnaws on a bone while cackling maniacally to itself. Near its nest is another iron door.
> 
> Lying on the floor near you are a pair of glass, bell-shaped horns attached to some loose wires. They look like they were removed from a pair of tall, slender, metal machines standing against the wall opposite you.
^277

The gnoll is a shapechanged [death slaad](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/death-slaad.md) under the effects of a [feeblemind](/compendium/spells/feeblemind.md) spell. While fighting alongside Yeenoghu's demon hordes, the slaad fell into the River Styx, leaving it in a feebleminded state. In five days, it gets a new saving throw to end the effect. Any character who examines the gnoll and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check realizes that some sort of magical effect has reduced it to a witless nincompoop.

While the slaad is feebleminded, its Intelligence and Charisma scores are 1, and it can't cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. It's not even self-aware enough to revert to its normal form. It eyes characters suspiciously but doesn't attack them. It has no weapons but can use its action to bite someone on its turn:

##### Bite

_Melee Weapon Attack_: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit_: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage.

Casting [greater restoration](/compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md), [heal](/compendium/spells/heal.md), or similar magic on the hapless creature restores its mental faculties, whereupon the slaad assumes its true form and attacks. As a creature of pure chaos and extreme malice, it delights in wanton destruction.

##### Machinery

The bell-shaped horns lying on the floor attach to the fronts of the two machines standing in the corner, neither of which is operational. Each machine resembles a vertical file cabinet covered with switches and burnt-out lights. A character who spends at least 1 hour taking apart a machine can discern its original purpose with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check:

- The larger machine was used to transmit messages to other flying fortresses. (Messages were sent by speaking into the machine's glass bell.)
- The smaller machine was used to broadcast messages throughout the flying fortress. (One could broadcast a message by speaking into the machine's glass bell.)

The larger machine is damaged beyond repair, but a character proficient with [tinker's tools](/compendium/items/tinkers-tools.md) can spend 1 hour attempting to repair the smaller machine using parts scavenged from other machines on the command deck, doing so with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. Once the machine's glass bell and a few wires are replaced, the device can be made to function for 24 hours. During this time, characters can use the device to transmit their voices throughout the wrecked fortress.

#### W5. Adamantine Rods

This chamber is at the lowest point of the command deck. Describe the room to the players as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This dark room contains a metal console that has torn free of the wall to your right. Pinned between the console and another wall is a small, desiccated, winged devil that looks like it was crushed to death. In another corner stands a 3-foot block of infernal iron—a locked safe with clawed feet and a three-dial mechanism built into its thick door. Each dial bears numerals written in Infernal.
^27b

The safe is stuck to the floor with [sovereign glue](/compendium/items/sovereign-glue.md) and can't be moved. It's also airtight, watertight, and impervious to damage and [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md). To unlock it, the characters need the three-digit combination. When the dials are set to **6 - 6 - 6** ("6-6-6" in Infernal), the safe door unlocks. Three [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spells are needed to force it open, as the safe has three separate locking mechanisms.

After three unsuccessful attempts to open the safe with the wrong combination, an alarm klaxon sounds throughout the command deck. The alarm is loud enough to startle any vrocks still circling above the wreck, but the alarm attracts no one. The alarm stops after 1 minute.

The safe contains nine adamantine rods, each one weighing 3 pounds and engraved with runes that spell out the words "Solar Insidiator Lock" in Infernal, followed by a number from 1 to 9. These are the rods that the characters are searching for. Characters familiar with [Thavius Kreeg](/compendium/bestiary/npc/thavius-kreeg-bgdia.md)'s infernal contract recall that "Solar Insidiator" is another name for the Companion. Armed with this knowledge, a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can conclude that the rods were designed to unlock the Companion, suggesting that it might contain something.

##### Dead Devil

A spined devil was operating the console when the fortress crashed into Avernus. The console tore free of one wall and pinned the devil against another wall, crushing it to death. The console is nonfunctional, and its original purpose can't be ascertained.

#### W6. Black Bell

Once per minute, a hollow "ka-clunk" sound emanates from this room, which contains the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This room contains two rusty iron crates in one corner and an iron, bell-shaped contraption bolted to the floor in the opposite corner. The bell is nine feet tall and painted black, with several dents and dings in it. Every so often, the bell emits a loud "ka-clunk" sound.
^27e

Each crate contains twenty iron flasks of demon ichor (see "Demon Ichor").

A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the bell-shaped contraption. Any character who examines the bell and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can ascertain its purpose: it kept the fortress aloft and level with the ground. The noise it makes is a rhythmic malfunction caused by the fact that the fortress is leaning to one side.

#### W7. Stirge Nest

Describe this area to the players as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This chamber contains a stripped-down metal console and several rusty pipes that extend from floor to ceiling. One of the pipes has a two-foot-long gash in it.
^280

The console's original purpose can't be determined.

Ten [stirges](/compendium/bestiary/beast/stirge.md) nest in the pipe with the gash in it. If the pipe is jostled or otherwise disturbed, the stirges fly out and attack.

#### W8. Signal Desks

This hall has four doors leading off it. Behind each door is a closet with a miniature console and chair bolted to the floor. These consoles have keys and function like Infernal typewriters. An imp stationed at each console would type orders from superiors on small slips of paper before delivering them to their intended recipients. Rigged above each desk is a long, slender horn through which bridge officers could dictate their orders.

#### Development

As the characters prepare to leave, a warband arrives to scavenge the wreck. This warband is led by one of the warlords described in the "Warlords of the Avernian Wastelands" section. The characters have a few rounds to hide, set an ambush, or return to their vehicles before the enemy warband arrives.

Each warlord has a different reason for visiting the wreck, as outlined below.

**Bitter Breath**. The horned devil is thinking about turning the wreck into a base and wants to inspect it.

**Feonor**. The archmage heard a rumor that someone has been stockpiling demon ichor inside the wreck, and she plans to steal it.

**Princeps Kovik**. Kovik's spies in [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md)'s Forge have told the chain devil about the adamantine rods. Kovik plans to sell them to [Mahadi](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mahadi-the-rakshasa-bgdia.md) (see "Mahadi, Emporium Master") for [soul coins](/compendium/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md).

#### Returning the Rods to Bel

[Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) isn't really expecting the characters to return the nine adamantine rods to him, and he looks positively disappointed if they do. ("We didn't even sign a contract!" he laments.) Rather, he hoped they might use the rods to unlock the Companion, thereby freeing the planetar trapped within it and potentially ruining Zariel's plans for Elturel. Bringing the nine rods back to [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) merely implicates him in the plot to free the planetar. After uttering a few choice curse words, he strongly encourages the characters to take the rods to Elturel, stick them in locks along the Companion's equator, and see what happens.

Happy to let the characters keep the rods, [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) makes good on his promise to reveal the location of the Bleeding Citadel. He tells the characters that the [Sword of Zariel](/compendium/items/sword-of-zariel-bgdia.md) is a good-aligned artifact that Avernus itself has long sought to destroy. [Bel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bel-bgdia.md) urges them to find the sword quickly, before the Bleeding Citadel is swallowed up by Avernus and the sword is lost forever. If [Lulu](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lulu-bgdia.md) is still with the party, she urges the characters to recover the sword before heading back to Elturel.
