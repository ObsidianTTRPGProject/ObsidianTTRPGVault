# Introduction
*Source: Essentials Kit: Divine Contention* 

_Divine Contention_ is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure designed for characters of 11th through 12th level set in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. By the end of the adventure the characters should reach 13th level. You can run the adventure for as few as one player or as many as six players.

You can run _Divine Contention_ as a stand-alone adventure or as the concluding part in a trilogy called _Beyond the Dragon of Icespire Peak_ (of which Storm Lord's Wrath is the first adventure and Sleeping Dragon's Wake is the second). This adventure trilogy can be played as a sequel to Dragon of Icespire Peak, the adventure that comes with the _D&D Essentials Kit_.

## Running the Adventure

To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks: the "Player's Handbook", "Dungeon Master's Guide", and "Monster Manual". The "Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide" is helpful but not necessary.

The "Monster Manual" contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are included there or in appendix A. When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block in the "Monster Manual", unless the adventure's text instead refers you to the monster appendix in this adventure.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the "Player's Handbook". Magic items are described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

## Running for One Player

If you're running this adventure for a single player, you can give that player a sidekick as a secondary character. Let the player choose one of the pregenerated sidekicks that come with this adventure. If a sidekick is lost or no longer needed, the player character can return to Leilon and acquire a new one.

### Using Sidekicks

Make sure the player understands the roles and limitations of sidekicks in this adventure:

- Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, including things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.
- Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should complement those of the main character. For example, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a fighter or rogue.

### Conyberry

The Triboar Trail runs right through this abandoned town, which was sacked by barbarians years ago and now lies in ruins.

### Crags

These rocky, windswept hills are dotted with old mines that have become infested with monsters.

### High Road

This highway hugs the coast, connecting Neverwinter to the coastal cities of Luskan to the north and Waterdeep to the south. For years, the stretch of road south of Neverwinter fell into disuse because of frequent monster attacks. Recently, efforts have been made to keep the road safe, with light patrols of guards on horseback moving between Neverwinter and Leilon.

### Kryptgarden Forest

This ancient forest tucked behind the Sword Mountains contains the ruins of bygone dwarven civilizations. The abandoned lair of the green dragon Claugiyliamatar, nicknamed the Old Gnawbone, is found in these woods. During Sleeping Dragons Wake, [Claugiyliamatar](/compendium/bestiary/npc/claugiyliamatar-skt.md) was possessed by the wraith of the ancient dracolich Chardansearavitriol, also known as [Ebondeath](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ebondeath-dc.md), which now loyally serves the worshipers of Myrkul (see "Mere of Dead Men").

### Leilon

This small town along the High Road has just rebuilt itself after being abandoned for years. It serves as the starting location for the adventure. For more information, see "Welcome to Leilon."

### Mere of Dead Men

Travelers on the High Road, which skirts the mere to the east, must resist being lured into the cold and desolate waters. Many have perished in the mere, drawn by tales of ruined castles half-sunk in the mire. The Mere of Dead Men contains the tomb of the dracolich Chardansearavitriol, which is now the headquarters of the cult of Myrkul. For more information on this location, see "Ebondeath's Mausoleum."

### Neverwinter

This city was badly damaged when Mount Hotenow erupted some fifty years ago. Now, the City of Skilled Hands works to rebuild under the watchful eye of its Lord Protector, Dagult Neverember, who rules in the absence of an heir to Neverwinter's crown. At present, no legitimate heirs to the old Alagondar royal line are known to exist, and many believe that the line is ended. Lord Neverember, taking no chances, quietly pays off or disposes of anyone claiming a connection to the rulers of old.

### Neverwinter Wood

The forest east of Neverwinter seems to have a magical quality about it, or at least an air of mystical secrecy. Reclusive spellcasters are rumored to dwell deep within.

### Phandalin

Nestled in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, Phandalin is a sleepy mining settlement that recently had dealings with a white dragon named Cryovain. The dragon was dispatched by a group of adventurers. For more information, see Dragon of Icespire Peak in the _D&D Essentials Kit_.

### Starmetal Hills

This range of rocky knolls is so named because the area has been the impact site of several meteor showers over millennia. The hills are haunted by ruthless barbarian tribes, giving others little reason to visit the area.

### Sword Mountains

These steep, craggy, snow-capped mountains are home to scattered tribes of orcs as well as many monsters. Icespire Peak is the tallest among them. Their foothills are strewn with the ruins of bygone kingdoms, and more than a few half-forgotten dungeons and tombs.

### Triboar Trail

This path south of Neverwinter Wood is the safest route between Neverwinter and the town of Triboar, located in the Dessarin Valley to the east. The trail is not patrolled, and monster attacks are commonplace.

## The Adventure Begins

The adventure begins in the town of Leilon, which has been recently reconstructed after being abandoned for many years. The characters can receive quests, choose which ones to pursue, and experience encounters in Leilon. While Leilon is described in Storm Lord's Wrath and Sleeping Dragon's Wake, the settlers from Neverwinter have now finished their reconstruction of the town, adding new locations the characters can visit.

The "Adventure Background" section describes the events leading up to the adventure and the main threats the characters will face. The "Welcome to Leilon" and "Exploring Leilon" sections describe the town where the adventure begins. Knowing Leilon well ensures a smooth start to the adventure.

### Adventure Background

The ruined town of Leilon was once a fortified settlement on the High Road midway between the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep. The Lord Protector of Neverwinter, Dagult Neverember, hired a group of his citizens to rebuild the town, a construction project that has recently completed. They hope to create a fortified waypoint for travelers and merchants that can ward off the threats of the surrounding wilderness.

Two forces of evil are on the rise nearby, eager to control the region around Leilon and eventually the Sword Coast for themselves. The first is a cult of Talos, god of storms, led by their champion Fheralai Stormsworm. The cult's headquarters are inside a death knight dreadnaught, an undead galleon, which prowls the coast looking for trade ships to plunder.

Ularan Mortus, a priest of Myrkul, god of death, and his followers are raising an army of undead to lay siege to the city of Neverwinter. The spirit of the dead black dragon Chardansearavitriol, known also as [Ebondeath](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ebondeath-dc.md), has recently allied with Ularan Mortus to steal a mythical artifact called the [ruinstone](/compendium/items/ruinstone-dc.md) from a tower inside Leilon.

The people of Leilon have just begun to uncover the threats both groups pose to the region. They need the help of adventurers if they want their rebuilt settlement to survive the danger.

### Upcoming Threats

Visitors to Leilon soon learn the following troubling rumors. Ensure your players are briefed on these threats before they choose quests from the quest board.

- Two rival cults, worshipers of Talos, god of storms, and Myrkul, god of death, are clashing in the wilds outside town.
- If Fheralai Stormsworn died during Sleeping Dragon's Wake, word reaches town that Talos has raised her from the dead.
- It is said that Myrkul has also performed a miracle to grant Ularan Mortus an undead army.
- The town council believes that the cultists are plotting to invade Leilon in order to seize control of the High Road.
