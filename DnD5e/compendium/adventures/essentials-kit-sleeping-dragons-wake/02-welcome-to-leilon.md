# Welcome to Leilon
*Source: Essentials Kit: Sleeping Dragon's Wake* 

Leilon was once a mining town that sold copper, nickel, and silver to Waterdeep. It was also a small port where merchants sometimes offloaded goods on barges (since most proper ships can't traverse the town's shallow mud flats) to be transported to cities all over the Sword Coast.

Two hundred years ago, the wizard Thalivar made his home here and raised a tower at the town center to conduct his mystical studies. The House of Thalivar was topped with a planar beacon that lured creatures from other planes into the structure and trapped them there. After Thalivar mysteriously disappeared, the people of Leilon were content to leave his tower and the monsters within alone.

The Spellplague, a divine phenomenon that twisted Faerûn's magic, corrupted the tower's defenses. The creatures sealed within were freed to attack Leilon, and the magic of the planar beacon was redirected back into the Material Plane, causing humanoids who looked upon it to become paralyzed. Leilon was quickly overrun and subsequently abandoned and has remained that way for more than a century.

The first action the soldiery of Neverwinter took in Leilon was to destroy the planar beacon inside the House of Thalivar. The mage Gallio Elibro has now rebuilt the beacon and begun his own studies into the Ethereal Plane.

Before its fall, Leilon was defended by a loosely organized group of adventurers called the Swords of Leilon. When the House of Thalivar released its monsters, the Swords fought to cover the escape of the townsfolk. They died and became ghosts bound to Leilon's ruins. They now watch the rebuilding of the town with caution, hoping that the reconstructed tower does not bring similar disaster.

When you are ready for the adventure to get underway, show the Leilon map to the players and read the following boxed text aloud:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The half-finished palisade of Leilon will soon make a complete semicircle on the northeast side of the town, defended by an earthen rampart. To the southwest, new settlers attempt to build docks for barges, made to cross the marsh and meet merchant ships in the sea.
> 
> Outside of town, the settlers' campground becomes ever smaller as new buildings made of wood or stone with thatched roofs are erected in Leilon's muddy streets. At the center of it all, the New House of Thalivar, a cylindrical wizard tower, rises like a beacon, four times the height of every other building. Some lots still lie in ruins, but the settlers work quickly, clearing and reconstructing.
> 
> Visitors with coin to spend are welcome in Leilon, and adventurers are the settlers' favorites. While there is much work to be done within the town, there are also missions to accomplish outside the settlement, listed on the job board at the fishery.

When the adventurers are ready to inspect the job board, proceed to the "Fishery" section.

## Exploring Leilon

The characters might wish to explore key establishments within Leilon. These locations are marked on the map of Leilon.

### Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe

This shop is crammed with curiosities dredged from the ruins of Leilon: old fishing rods, swamp idols, mining helmets, and other oddities. A whimsical Illuskan male named Aubrey Silverspun runs the store. Roll a d20 on Peculiarities table to see what he has on offer when the characters visit.

**Peculiarities**

| dice: d20 | Peculiarity | Price |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| 1–3 | Random magic item from Magic Item Table C in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" | 500 gp |
| 4–10 | Random trinket from "chapter 5" of the "Player's Handbook" | 10 gp |
| 11–20 | Unique set of tools (that is engraved or otherwise adorned) | 50 gp |
^peculiarities

### Barge Yard

Six mud-covered barges are chained together and beached at the edge of Leilon where the town meets the marsh. The barge master is a gruff elderly female dwarf named Rorsta Anvilhand. She rents a barge for a tenday for 10 gp.

### Fishery

In recent days, the town fishery has become a more permanent structure. During the day, the warehouse hosts several fishers selling their daily catches at stalls, and merchants who sell and repair fishing equipment. At night, Leilon's town council gathers within the building to discuss the construction of the town and active threats in the region. The current town council has the following members:

- Merrygold Brightshine (see "Lathander Shrine" for more information).
- Valdi Estapaar, an elderly female half-elf fisher who keeps the settler camp fed.
- Grizzelda Copperwraught, a grumpy dwarf architect in charge of rebuilding the town, whom everyone calls "The Growler" behind her back.
- Jack Torver, the newest council member (see "Torver's Post" for more information).

A job board outside of the fishery holds notices for adventurers looking for work. If the characters inspect the job board, proceed to the "The Quest Board" section.

### House of Thalivar

Gallio Elibro is a brooding middle-aged male Rashemi human [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) (with the [legend lore](/compendium/spells/legend-lore.md) spell prepared instead of [cone of cold](/compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md)). He came to Neverwinter to find and unlock the secrets of the House of Thalivar and found many coded journals in the ruin, which he has set about decoding with slow progress. The mage hopes to rebuild the tower's beacon and study creatures of the astral plane.

Gallio does not talk much about his work with adventurers but is willing to cast the [legend lore](/compendium/spells/legend-lore.md) spell in exchange for 400 gp.

### Idol Island

Rising from the marsh mere yards from Leilon, Idol Island contains the remains of crumbled statues of forgotten human nobles. The settlers claim to hear voices whispering from the island at night, inviting them to view their destinies. If the characters walk by the island at night, they hear these whispers as well.

A character who spends the night on the island taking a long rest has vague, prophetic dreams of adventures to come. For instance, the character might view the face of an ancient green dragon, a horde of zombies, or a sahuagin attack. At the end of the rest, the character must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the character is bolstered by the strange dreams and gains inspiration. On a failure, the character gains a level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).

### Lathander Shrine

This shrine to Lathander, god of light, was the first temple to be reconstructed in Leilon. Merrygold Brightshine, an outgoing young female halfling [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md), cares for the shrine and offers counsel to any who pray at the small stone altar to Lathander. She conducts services at the shrine each day at dawn.

Merrygold casts the [cure wounds](/compendium/spells/cure-wounds.md) spell for a donation of 10 gp to the shrine and the [lesser restoration](/compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell for a donation of 20 gp.

### Settler Camp

The camp outside the palisade of Leilon is home to settlers who have not yet erected a home for themselves in the town. The muddy gathering of tents and cook fires becomes smaller by the day, but those who remain are exhausted from their daily labor and the constant guard shifts to keep the camp safe from monsters and wildlife.

The leader of the settler camp is a witty elderly female Chondathan human named Mazira Shae. She knows everything happening in town and can point characters anywhere they need to go, with a side of humor and sass.

### Torver's Post

Jack Torver is an optimistic young male Turami human who just finished building Leilon's new (and currently only) general store. He is a devout worshipper of Lathander and attends the shrine's services each morning, then offers advice from the sermons to his customers.

Jack sells standard adventuring gear, with the exception of [potions of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md). He directs adventurers looking for potions to the Tymora shrine and those looking for armor, weapons, or other items he can't supply to the town square.

### Town Square

The Leilon town square has become a place where local vendors and those passing through town can set up stalls to sell their wares. One vendor, a female Calishite human blacksmith named Zana Taylish, is a resident of Leilon who sells armor and weapons. More exotic items (such as spell scrolls or other consumable magic items) could be available from a traveling merchant in the square at the DMs discretion. The cost for such items should be high (and perhaps require a favor of the adventurers in addition to an exchange of coin).

### Tymora Shrine

A shrine to Tymora, goddess of luck, was recently erected in Leilon. Puck Caribdas, a lithe, rambunctious male elf, runs the temple and sells potions for the prices listed on the Puck's Potions table. Other than [potions of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md), Puck only has 1d4 vials of each potion. Each tenday, Puck's inventory refreshes, and you can reroll to determine the elf's new potion supply.

**Puck's Potions**

| Price | Potion |
|-------|--------|
| 50 gp | [Potion of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md) |
| 50 gp | [Potion of climbing](/compendium/items/potion-of-climbing.md) |
| 150 gp | [Potion of growth](/compendium/items/potion-of-growth.md) |
| 150 gp | [Potion of water breathing](/compendium/items/potion-of-water-breathing.md) |
| 5,000 gp | [Potion of heroism](/compendium/items/potion-of-heroism.md) |
^pucks-potions

### Umber Hulk's Shell Inn

Alion Malwyn, a kind-hearted, nonbinary Illuskan human, runs this newly constructed two-story inn. A bed for the night costs 5 sp, while a meal costs 1 sp. If the characters stay here, Alion shares a tale from another traveler with them. Roll a d6 and consult the Leilon Tales table to determine which tale Alion knows or pick a tale the characters haven't heard yet.

**Leilon Tales**

| dice: d6 | Tale |
|----------|------|
| 1 | "The famers at Leilon Point have seen more shark fins in the water lately. Some even claim to see humanoids swimming alongside the sharks! Can you imagine?" (If the characters visit Leilon Point, see "Leilon Point" for more information.) |
| 2 | "Merchants from Neverwinter claim to have passed something massive out at sea near an old lighthouse on their way into town. They couldn't agree if what they saw was a boat or a beached whale, but they agreed it stank. (If the characters investigate the site, see "Death Knight-Dreadnaught" for more information.) |
| 3 | "A few local merchants claim to have been attacked on the road by a band of brigands calling themselves the Chimera Crew! Bandits sure have gotten more colorful these days." (If the characters investigate the attacks, see "Iniarv's Tower" for more information.) |
| 4 | "A few hunters came by saying to avoid Kryptgarden Forest, the dead are walking around there!" |
| 5 | "Did you hear about the bronze dragon? Apparently, a few travelers from Neverwinter saw one fly north along the coast with a dolphin in its claws. They say those metallic dragons are good. I hope they're right." |
| 6 | "You ever hear of Claugiyliamatar? She's a great green dragon with a lair somewhere in Kryptgarden Forest. Folks around here call her Old Gnawbone because she loves devouring people like us. Be careful if you're going in that place. You don't want to run into her." |

### The Quest Board

The job board outside the fishery is where the adventurers can learn about quests. Let the players choose the order in which they tackle them. If the players don't like a quest, they are under no obligation to complete it. However, completing quests helps the characters become more powerful (see "Leveling Up").

Most of the notices on the job board are written by members of the town council. The council members are unable to provide context beyond what is written on the board. When the characters return to the fishery after completing a quest, the council pays the reward immediately.

> [!quote] Adventure Locations
> 
> This adventure encourages characters to explore locations marked on the DM's map of the Sword Coast. When the characters embark on a journey to a location, use the section of this adventure that describes that location in detail. For instance, if the players choose to undertake the Iniarv's Tower Quest, go to the "Iniarv's Tower" section. Each location includes an overview that briefly describes what the characters can expect to find there, followed by information you'll need to run the encounters at that location.
^adventure-locations

#### Starting Quests

When the characters first visit the job board, there are two quests posted. Describe each quest so they can choose which to pursue.

#### Death Knight-Dreadnaught Quest

"Phandalin had some trouble with a cult of Talos in a lighthouse temple called the Tower of Storms. Now a strange boat or dead creature seems to be beached near the tower. Investigate this strange occurrence, kill or rout any cultists that might be there, then return to the town council to collect a reward of six [potions of greater healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md)." If the characters undertake this quest, see "Death Knight-Dreadnaught."

#### Leilon Point Quest

"Farmers in the small community of Leilon Point report aquatic humanoids making small but frequent raids on the area. They're killing farmers and burning Leilon's food supply. Kill or rout the raiders, then return to the town council to collect a reward of 750 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, see "Leilon Point."

#### Follow-Up Quests

After the characters complete either one of the starting quests, the following two quests are added to the job board.

The Bronze Shrine Quest is not actually added to the job board by the town council, but by the ghost of one of the Swords of Leilon, who possessed a citizen of Neverwinter to post the quest. If the characters complete this quest, the town council denies having posted the message but thinks the information is valuable and rewards the characters all the same.

#### Bronze Shrine Quest

"Go north along the coast and track the bronze dragon [Lhammaruntosz](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lhammaruntosz-sdw.md), the Claws of the Coast, to her lair. This location looks like a bronze dragon carved into the side of a cliff overlooking the sea. Ask for a chance to worship at the shrine to Bahamut so you may receive visions of the threats facing Leilon. Report the threats you divine to the town council to collect a reward of 1,000 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, see "Bronze Shrine."

#### Iniarv's Tower Quest

"A band of brigands calling themselves the Chimera Crew has been attacking merchants on the road, stealing supplies we need to rebuild Leilon. The merchants claim that the bandits operate out of Iniarv's Tower in the Mere of Dead Men. Kill the bandits or drive them from the area, then return to the town council to collect a reward of 1,000 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, see "Iniarv's Tower."

#### Claugiyliamatar's Lair Quest

Another quest in this adventure takes place in Claugiyliamatar's lair. There is no job board notice for this quest, but the Bronze Shrine Quest should lead characters to an encounter with Claugiyliamatar. If the characters undertake this quest, see "Claugiyliamatar's Lair."

### Leveling Up

Characters advance in level by completing quests. Regardless of the number of characters in the party, the rate of advancement is as follows:

- Characters gain a level when they complete two quests.
- Characters gain another level when they complete the remaining three quests in this adventure.
