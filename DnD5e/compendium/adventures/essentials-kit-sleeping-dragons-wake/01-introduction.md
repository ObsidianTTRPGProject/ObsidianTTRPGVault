# Introduction
*Source: Essentials Kit: Sleeping Dragon's Wake* 

_Sleeping Dragon's Wake_ is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure designed for characters of 9th through 10th level and takes place in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. By the end of the adventure the characters should reach 11th level. You can run the adventure for as few as one player or as many as six players.

You can run it as a stand-alone adventure or as the middle adventure in a trilogy called _Beyond the Dragon of Icespire Peak_ (of which Storm Lord's Wrath is the first adventure and Divine Contention is the last). This adventure trilogy can be played as a sequel to Dragon of Icespire Peak, the adventure that comes with the _D&D Essentials Kit_.

## Running the Adventure

To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks: the "Player's Handbook", "Dungeon Master's Guide", and "Monster Manual". The "Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide" is helpful but not necessary.

The "Monster Manual" contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are included there or in appendix A. When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block in the "Monster Manual", unless the adventure's text instead refers you to the monster appendix in this adventure.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the "Player's Handbook". Magic items are described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

## Running for One Player

If you're running this adventure for a single player, you can give that player a sidekick as a secondary character. Let the player choose one of the pregenerated sidekicks that come with this adventure in appendix B. If a sidekick is lost or no longer needed, the player character can return to Leilon and acquire a new one.

### Using Sidekicks

Make sure the player understands the roles and limitations of sidekicks in this adventure:

- Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, including things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.
- Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should complement those of the main character. For example, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a fighter or rogue.

### Adjusting Encounters

This adventure contains advice for adjusting encounters based on the number of characters in the party. You are empowered to modify the number of enemies in an encounter and their hit point totals as you see fit. If you need to adjust the difficulty of an encounter during combat, you can alter hit point totals without the player characters ever knowing and have enemies retreat or reinforcements arrive as needed.

### Conyberry

The Triboar Trail runs right through this abandoned town, which was sacked by barbarians years ago and now lies in ruins.

### Crags

These rocky, windswept hills are dotted with old mines that have become infested with monsters.

### High Road

This highway hugs the coast, connecting Neverwinter to the coastal cities of Luskan to the north and Waterdeep to the south. For years, the stretch of road south of Neverwinter fell into disuse because of frequent monster attacks. Recently, efforts have been made to keep the road safe, with light patrols of guards on horseback moving between Neverwinter and Leilon.

### Kryptgarden Forest

This ancient forest tucked behind the Sword Mountains contains the ruins of bygone dwarven civilizations. The ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar, nicknamed the Old Gnawbone, also lairs in the woods. For more information on this location, see "Claugiyliamatar's Lair."

### Leilon

This small town along the High Road is in the midst of rebuilding itself after being abandoned for years. It serves as the starting location for the adventure. For more information, see "Welcome to Leilon."

### Mere of Dead Men

Travelers on the High Road, which skirts the mere to the east, must resist being lured into this cold and desolate swamp by will-o's-wisps. Countless adventurers have perished in the mere, drawn by tales of ruined castles half-sunk in the mire. The Mere of Dead Men contains a ruined keep that once belonged to the lich Iniarv. For more information on this location, see "Iniarv's Tower."

### Neverwinter

This city was badly damaged when Mount Hotenow erupted some fifty years ago. Now, the City of Skilled Hands works to rebuild under the watchful eye of its Lord Protector, Dagult Neverember, who rules in the absence of an heir to Neverwinter's crown. At present, no legitimate heirs to the old Alagondar royal line are known to exist, and many believe that the line is ended. Lord Neverember, taking no chances, quietly pays off or disposes of anyone claiming a connection to the rulers of old.

### Neverwinter Wood

The forest east of Neverwinter seems to have a magical quality about it, or at least an air of mystical secrecy. Reclusive spellcasters are rumored to dwell deep within.

### Phandalin

Nestled in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, Phandalin is a nondescript mining settlement that recently had dealings with a white dragon named Cryovain. The dragon was dispatched by a group of adventurers. For more information see Dragon of Icespire Peak in the _D&D Essentials Kit_.

### Starmetal Hills

This range of rocky knolls is so named because the area has been the impact site of a number of meteor showers over millennia. The hills are haunted by ruthless barbarian tribes, giving others little reason to visit the area.

### Sword Mountains

These steep, craggy, snow-capped mountains are home to scattered tribes of orcs as well as many monsters. Icespire Peak is the tallest among them. Their foothills are strewn with the ruins of bygone kingdoms, and more than a few half-forgotten dungeons and tombs. A shrine to Bahamut, god of good dragons, is hidden in a network of caverns in the mountains. For more information on this location, see "Bronze Shrine."

### Triboar Trail

This path south of Neverwinter Wood is the safest route between Neverwinter and the town of Triboar, located in the Dessarin Valley to the east. The trail is not patrolled, and monster attacks are commonplace.

## The Adventure Begins

The adventure begins in the town of Leilon, which is currently undergoing reconstruction after being abandoned for many years. The characters can receive quests, choose which ones to pursue, and experience encounters in Leilon. While Leilon is described in Storm Lord's Wrath, the settlers from Neverwinter have continued to rebuild the town, adding new locations the characters can visit.

The "Adventure Background" section describes the events leading up to the adventure and the main threats the characters will face. The "Welcome to Leilon" and "Exploring Leilon" sections describe the town where the adventure begins. Knowing Leilon well will ensure a smooth start to the adventure.

> Some sections of this adventure reference Storm Lord's Wrath, which can be run as a predecessor to Sleeping Dragon's Wake. If you run Sleeping Dragon's Wake as a stand-alone adventure, you can ignore the references to Storm Lord's Wrath, since all the information you need from that adventure to run Sleeping Dragon's Wake is contained in the "Adventure Background" section.

### Adventure Background

The town of Leilon was once a fortified settlement on the High Road, midway between the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep. The settlement has been destroyed and rebuilt many times in its long history. The Lord Protector of Neverwinter, Dagult Neverember, recently hired a group of his citizens to rebuild the town, a construction project now well underway. They hope to create a fortified waypoint for travelers and merchants that can ward off the threats of the surrounding wilderness.

Two forces of evil are on the rise nearby, eager to control the region around Leilon and eventually the Sword Coast. The first is a cult of Talos, god of storms, led by the priestess Fheralai Stormsworm. The cult's headquarters are inside a death knight-dreadnaught, an undead battleship, beached near a temple of Talos called the Tower of Storms.

Ularan Mortus, a priest of Myrkul, god of death, and his followers are raising an army of undead to lay siege to the city of Neverwinter. The spirit of the dead black dragon Chardansearavitriol, also known as Ebondeath, aids Ularan Mortus in exchange for help finding and seizing the body of a living dragon to inhabit.

The people of Leilon have just begun to uncover the threats both groups pose to the region. They need the help of adventurers if they want their fledgling settlement to survive the danger.
