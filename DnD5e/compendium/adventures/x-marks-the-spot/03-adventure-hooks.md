# Adventure Hooks
*Source: X Marks the Spot, p. 2* 

The characters are on a mission for the Order of the Five Sacraments to retrieve the Hierophant's Chalice from the Temple of Aclazotz, deep in the uncharted forests of Ixalan. In addition to the bargains they have struck with the church, each character has been offered 100 gp to retrieve the sacred item and bring it to a rendezvous point south of the island stronghold of Fort Durron.

The backgrounds provided on the character sheets also provide motivations for the characters to come together as a party.

**Alante** hopes to gain favor with the Order of the Five Sacraments, a sect of the church that believes in establishing a trade relationship with the Sun Empire.

**Velisha** yearns to expel the unnatural forces that is rumored to reside in the Temple of Aclazotz.

**Rouxil** wants to bring an end to the conflict in this region of Ixalan by ensuring the Order of the Five Sacraments rises to power.

**Artinoq** desires peace and is eager to show is father that he is a worthy leader.

**Turk Two Coins** desires to claim a share of a great treasure, so that he can live out the rest of his life in debauchery.

**Ellie Redcap** wants nothing more than to captain her own ship—by whatever means necessary.

## Treasure

This adventure uses _Magic: The Gathering_ cards to help build momentum toward adventure progression, and to reward interactive play.

You'll need a handful of Treasure token cards (found in Ixalan booster packs) and a number of cards detailing treasures from the Ixalan set. See "Appendix D: Hidden Plunder" at the end of this adventure for the card list, then shuffle those nontoken cards to make an item deck.

Whenever a player advances an objective, makes an important discovery, or has a good idea, give that player a Treasure token. A player cannot have more than one Treasure token for his or her character. Random encounters then provide an opportunity to uncover a treasure cache. When searching an area, players roll against each other to find treasure, allowing one player to redeem a Treasure token and draw from the item deck.
