# X Marks the Spot
*Source: X Marks the Spot, p. 1* 

A prison escape for an unlikely group of heroes turns into a race for an ancient relic sought by the Legion of Dusk. Can you brave the unknown and capture the treasure before the enemy does? This D&D adventure is set on the plane of Ixalan, and uses 4th-level pregenerated characters.

## Background

Ixalan is a land of exploration and discovery. But the Legion of Dusk—a vampire society that formed from an alliance of nobles and the church—has recently arrived from overseas to expand its territories. The legion's army seeks to conquer the island, and the vampires have erected numerous forts in the south. However, their plans have been met with resistance from the inhabitants of Ixalan.

The Sun Empire rules the coast, and has managed to tame dinosaurs enough to work alongside them. Meanwhile, the River Heralds—a loose society of nomadic merfolk tribes—move throughout the interior of Ixalan, at one with nature. These two groups have long held an uneasy accord.

At sea, forces of the piratical Brazen Coalition harry the naval forces of the Legion of Dusk, which make landfall to plunder the bounty of Ixalan as they see fit. But even so, not all vampires view the current ruling establishment as the final authority. The Order of the Five Sacraments, a vampire church sect that believes in establishing a trade relationship with the Sun Empire, hopes to undermine the plans of the would-be conquerors.
