*Source: Spelljammer Academy* 

## Introduction

This adventure, designed for **three to seven 1st-level characters**, is the first in a series of four adventures. It is set in Spelljammer Academy on the island of Nimbral, many miles southwest of the Chultan peninsula in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.

### Background

Welcome to Spelljammer Academy! Promising recruits are trained here under the tutelage of experienced spelljammers, who prepare fledgling spacefarers for the perils of Wildspace and the Astral Sea. Cadets learn the finer points of ship-to-ship combat, space exploration, and (in some cases) clandestine operations. The newest batch of recruits has just arrived after a long, arduous sea voyage, but there's still much to do! Although it's business as usual at Spelljammer Academy, the new cadets soon learn that strange things are afoot.

The purpose of this adventure is to introduce the characters to Spelljammer Academy and foreshadow an unknown threat.

### Overview

This adventure takes approximately two hours to play and is split into three parts:

Part 1: Welcome to Wildspace! The recruits undertake a quick combat trial on the Simulations Deck, so that academy personnel can assess their skills.

Part 2: Academy Orientation. After the simulation, the new cadets receive a crash course on the academy's purpose and general layout, as they complete a laundry list of tasks to acclimate to their new home.

Part 3: Intruder Alert! The cadets deliver a crate of supplies to Mirt the Merciless, the head of the academy, but discover that their cargo contains a deadly surprise.

### Adventure Hooks

All the characters have volunteered, for whatever reason, to join Spelljammer Academy: a shadowy enclave of spellcasters and swords-for-hire situated on the remote and mysterious island of Nimbral. While the characters are still encouraged to develop backstories, they should be looking for adventure with few long-term bonds to tie them to their homelands. The campaign takes the characters to the stars and beyond, and there might be no coming back afterward!

_Orientation_ throws the characters right into the action. To maximize the impact of part 1 of the adventure, you might choose to downplay initial introductions and discussion of the characters' backstories, bringing up any connections between the characters only after the adventure's initial encounter has been resolved.

## Part 1: Welcome to Wildspace

Spelljammer Academy's newest recruits are brought to the Simulations Deck for a quick combat trial so that academy personnel can assess their skills and readiness. The magic of the Simulations Deck puts a unique spin on the training session, dropping player characters straight into the action.

### Right into the Action

When everyone is ready to begin, roll for initiative. Then read or paraphrase the following aloud:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You stand on the deck of your spelljamming ship, _Moonraider_, even as explosions obliterate two of its masts and hurl a dozen of your fellow sailors into Wildspace! Distant stars and wheeling clouds of multicolored gas spin around you as the first pirate galleon slams into _Moonraider_'s starboard side, and a gust of foul wind washes over you as the galleon's air envelope merges with your own. Seconds later, your vessel is boarded by astral reavers—humanoids possessed of strange features, waving cruel weapons, and unleashing blasts of magic.
> 
> Captain Sardax lies on the deck nearby, her body ruined by shrapnel. "Hold the top deck!" she snarls with her dying breath. "Grant them no quarter!"
^008

This encounter starts in the thick of the action. The characters are in the midst of a magical illusion used to train Spelljammer Academy cadets. The shock of being plunged into the illusory simulation has left them disoriented and unable to sense that what they see is only in their minds. Both the characters and the players should believe that the simulation is real. When your players ask the inevitable questions about how they got here, use the following to guide your answers:

- The characters know that they are crew members on _Moonraider_, but they have no recollection of events prior to the reavers' attack.
- The characters are new members of the crew, making their first journey into Wildspace.
- At a guess, it seems likely that the reavers have used some kind of magic to disorient _Moonraider_'s crew, hoping to make it easier to seize the ship.
- The characters know Captain Sardax and understand that her death leaves it up to them and the other surviving crew members to repel the reavers.
- The characters know and trust each other. _Moonraider_ is their ship, and they are bound to defend it!

"Forecastle Map" shows the layout of the area that the characters are defending. They are the only sailors still alive in this section of the ship.

### Fighting the Reavers

At the start of combat, place two astral reavers ([bandits](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)) at the edge of the forecastle area. Don't roll initiative for these enemies. Instead, all reavers act at the end of the initiative order, after the characters have taken their turns. More reavers then appear during the round (see below).

At the start of each character's turn, roll on the Battle Events table to determine a random event, which can include the appearance of new reavers. As each new enemy appears, roll on the Astral Reavers table to determine a special quality for them, and use these descriptions to help identify specific reavers in combat.

When you've played two full rounds of combat, proceed to the "End Simulation" section below.

**Battle Events**

| dice: d20 | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 1–12 | A new astral reaver ([bandit](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)) jumps into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the character. |
| 13 | An explosion rocks the ship. Each creature on the deck must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone). |
| 14 | A second spelljamming ship soars overhead, raining arrows down on the defenders. Each character must roll a d20. On a roll of 1–9, they are targeted by an arrow (+3 to hit, 3 piercing damage on a hit). |
| 15 | An untended coil of rope slams into the character, unfurling and reducing their speed by half until the end of their turn. |
| 16 | Loose rigging careens across the deck. Choose a character. That character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to grab the rigging and be safely flung to an unoccupied space within 40 feet of their current position. On a failure, they stay where they are and fall [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone). |
| 17 | The ship's dog, Bruno, rushes to the aid of a character of the player's choosing. The character can use a reaction to sip once from the healing keg around Bruno's neck (no action required), regaining 1d6 hit points. |
| 18–20 | An allied sailor on the main deck fires an arrow at a reaver (+3 to hit, 5 piercing damage on a hit). |
^battle-events

#### Astral Reavers

The reavers are coal-hearted miscreants united only by the urge to raid and pillage. Each reaver has the statistics of a [bandit](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) but has a unique appearance determined by the Astral Reavers table.

**Astral Reavers**

| dice: d12 | Appearance |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Serrated iron jaw and mechanical arm ending in oversized pincer |
| 2 | Giant goldfish-bowl head containing a floating brain |
| 3 | Four arms, two of which are used solely to perform threatening or insulting gestures |
| 4 | Iridescent scales and glowing pink eyes |
| 5 | Enormous nose and ears |
| 6 | Helicopter blades mounted on head (flying speed of 10 feet, with a maximum hovering altitude of 3 feet) |
| 7 | Infantile second head that continually spits curses |
| 8 | Burning beard, and breath that reeks of booze |
| 9 | Wears a torn wedding dress stained in blood |
| 10 | Blue-skinned, with a single large horn on forehead |
| 11 | Fishlike features and needlelike teeth |
| 12 | Reflective skin |
^astral-reavers

### End Simulation

After two full rounds of combat have been resolved, end the combat by reading or paraphrasing the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A thunderous explosion shakes the ship, filling the air with splinters of wood. Bodies are hurled into Wildspace—and then everything stops. Wreckage hangs motionless. Reavers freeze in the middle of their attacks. Even the stars stop twinkling.
> 
> The illusion of Wildspace melts away, and you find yourselves in one of the magical chambers of the Simulations Deck, your memories slowly fitting back into place. You recall being warned that your first experience of a Wildspace simulation would be disorienting—to test your ability to function under pressure.
> 
> A hulking figure emerges from the center of the explosion: a hadozee with a missing wing flap wearing a military uniform bristling with medals. The air around her smells like cigar smoke. "As you can see," Boatswain Tarto growls, "the battle of H'Catha didn't go so well for Captain Sardax and her crew. But her last battle makes a good testing ground for new recruits. End simulation!"
^00c

The characters remember meeting the hadozee training officer Boatswain Tarto (see the sidebar), and that the battle has been an illusory exercise conducted in one of the academy's simulation chambers—large circular spaces whose rune-scribed walls channel potent magical power, and which contain training versions of _spelljamming helms_ (akin to those used to propel real spelljamming ships). As the simulation ends, all characters regain any lost hit points, spell slots, or limited-use powers. Characters who died during the encounter discover that they were merely [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious), and each gains one level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) from lingering psychic shock.

With the training exercise complete, the new recruits are ready for debriefing and orientation. Proceed to "Part 2: Academy Orientation."

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Boatswain Tarto (Spelljammer Corps Training Officer)
> 
> _Hadozee Seasoned Boatswain_
> 
> The scars that Boatswain Tarto (pronounced BOE-sun TAR-toe) bears are testament to her status as a battle-hardened veteran. Despite having one of her wing flaps torn away long ago, she remains as capable as ever while on board a ship. Spelljammer Academy has no better person to spearhead the training of raw recruits—and Tarto knows it. Never one to mince words (even when those words are directed toward those who outrank her), this old, grizzled hadozee has light-tan skin and ebon-black fur graying at the temples. She's perpetually shrouded in a thick haze of cigar smoke, the smell of which often signals her imminent arrival.
> 
> **Quote**: "Listen to what I tell you; it might just save your life."
^00d

## Part 2: Academy Orientation

Spelljammer Academy's newest cadets are given an extensive orientation. With an assigned list of orientation tasks at hand, the characters have a chance to visit various areas of the academy, noting which areas are off-limits to stripling cadets—and the dire punishments that can be meted out on those who stray into unauthorized territory.

### Debriefing

When you're ready to start, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You arrived this morning on _Belligerence_, a chartered galley out of Waterdeep, which picked up passengers and crew in the Moonshae Isles, Baldur's Gate, Candlekeep, and Port Nyanzaru. You've come to seek fortune and glory at Spelljammer Academy: a secret enclave of spellcasters and swords-for-hire on the mysterious isle of Nimbral. Graduates from the academy join the Spelljammer Fleet, a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and explore worlds far beyond.
> 
> The academy is carved into a two-thousand-foot-high column of rock that juts up from the cliffs of the island's west coast, its multiple levels connected by stairs, ramps, and magical lifts. After docking in a sea cave at the base of the column, you marched to the Simulations Deck midway up the academy spire. Your mettle has been tested, and now it's time to settle in!
^010

Give the players a copy of handout 1, "Spelljammer Academy Map."

During the characters' debriefing, Boatswain Tarto gives each of them a pitiless assessment of their performance during the trial. As training officer, it's her job to whip new recruits into shape and show that everybody has room for improvement. Be appropriate and mindful of your players, however. A truly good leader isn't needlessly rude or cruel in their criticisms.

After the debriefing, Boatswain Tarto explains the history and mission of Spelljammer Academy (see the accompanying sidebar). Any character with spellcasting talent qualifies to join the Spelljammers, the contingent of those able to pilot a spelljamming ship. Everyone else must join the ranks of the Spelljammer Corps.

Tarto informs the cadets that they must complete several orientation tasks before the day is out (see "Orientation Tasks" below). The tasks can be completed in any order.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Spelljammer Academy
> 
> While adventurers of all stripes explore Faerûn and deal with the perils of ancient ruins, malevolent cults, and long-forgotten tombs, those who come through Spelljammer Academy on Nimbral strive to protect the world from far greater threats. Spelljammer Academy trains cadets for service as Spelljammers and members of the Spelljammer Corps: both branches of a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and to explore other worlds beyond. Few people know of the academy's existence, and its leaders try to keep it that way.
> 
> Mirt the Merciless—also known as "the Old Wolf"—is Spelljammer Academy's founder and chief financial officer. He manages the institution's operations alongside a small group of powerful high-ranking officers, known collectively as "the Bridge." While most of its candidates are from Toril, the academy occasionally recruits from outside Realmspace (the Wildspace system that is home to the planet Toril) to bring individuals with unique talents into their ranks. Giff, githyanki, hadozee, plasmoids, and myriad other peoples can join the cadets alongside folk native to Toril.
> 
> The academy was founded by Mirt as part of a joint investment with the retired elf adventurer Elmandar, who operates a shop on the Rock of Bral—a city built on an asteroid. Prince Andru, the monarch of Bral, has invested heavily in the academy, though his support has waned of late over questions regarding security within the institution.
^011

#### Orientation Tasks

The characters' orientation tasks appear on handout 2 for the players:

> [!quote] Orientation Tasks
> 
> ALL CADETS: COLLECT WELCOME PACK FROM ADMINISTRATION
> 
> ALL CADETS: REPORT TO QUARTERS FOR BUNK ASSIGNMENT
> 
> ALL CADETS: REPORT TO SKY DOCK FOR SPELLJAMMING SHIP INSPECTION
> 
> CORP CADETS ONLY: COLLECT SERVICE WEAPONRY FROM MISTER BLIP IN STORES
> 
> SPELLJAMMER CADETS ONLY: REPORT TO SPELLJAMMER NEXUS FOR BASIC TRAINING
> 
> ALL CADETS: COMPLETE GYMNASIUM ASSAULT COURSE
^orientation-tasks

The task list also features a note regarding security, which the characters see posted throughout the academy:

> [!quote] Warning!
> 
> Due to recent thefts, security checkpoints are in operation throughout campus. Failure to stop when challenged will result in disintegration!
^warning

If asked about the thefts, Tarto reveals that several navigational charts depicting Realmspace were stolen recently from the Spelljammer Nexus, the training area for Spelljammer cadets. The thefts have shaken the confidence of the academy's investors and caused them to reduce their monthly funding. Mirt is not happy!

Boatswain Tarto tells the characters to get on with their tasks, then report back to her once all those tasks are complete. Tarto remains on the Simulations Deck.

### Exploring the Academy

The characters are now free to explore the campus. See "Academy Locations" below for information on each area noted in the orientation tasks.

#### Security Levels

Spelljammer Academy has a five-tier security system. Each tier is represented by a different color, as shown below on the Security Levels table. Security levels increase from green to gold, and each higher level has access to all areas accessible to lower security levels.

Academy personnel wear uniforms in the color of their security access level. The characters are inducted as cadets (level 2) and must visit administration to collect their uniforms. To access higher security levels, academy cadets and personnel must request a security helmet: a rigid leather cap dyed in the appropriate color.

Security checkpoints are set up throughout the academy, each guarded by three [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md). Each guard carries a shortsword that has a green-glowing blade. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by one of these blades is instantly turned to dust, as if affected by a [disintegrate](/compendium/spells/disintegrate.md) spell. Such a sword loses its magical properties if removed from Spelljammer Academy.

Security guards refuse access to anyone not wearing the appropriate attire.

**Security Levels**

| Security Level | Rank | Locations |
|----------------|------|-----------|
| 1: Green | Visitor | Administration (except Record Room), Sea Dock (except Cargo area), Simulations Deck (except Officers' Mess) |
| 2: Red | Cadet | Cadet Quarters, Gymnasium, Spelljammer Nexus, Stores |
| 3: Blue | Sailor | Sea Dock (Cargo area), Sky Dock |
| 4: Purple | Officer | Administration (Record Room), Simulations Deck (Officers' Mess) |
| 5: Gold | Bridge | Bridge Quarters |
^security-levels

#### Academy Events

As the characters explore the academy, you can roll on the Academy Events table at any point to help you bring the campus to life.

**Academy Events**

| dice: d8 | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | A halfling cadet dashes past, clearly late for training. Turning a corner, they bump into a pair of plasmoid cadets—and become partially stuck in one of them! After pulling themself out and helping the plasmoid correct their uniform, the halfling runs on, shouting an apology. |
| 2 | Two cadets face off in a game that magically projects illusory spelljamming ships above the game board. |
| 3 | A visiting giff dignitary is inspecting the campus, escorted by academy officers. When the giff loudly breaks wind, the officers politely carry on as though nobody heard it. |
| 4 | A magical voice announces: "All purple rank security officers report to the Sky Dock for docking inspection." |
| 5 | A manacled [mind flayer](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) passes by on a gurney pushed by fleet officers. The mind flayer wears an iron mask with bands restraining its facial tentacles. |
| 6 | Strange glowing fish swim through the air, phasing through walls as they go. Nobody appears bothered by them. |
| 7 | A magical voice announces: "Ectoplasmic breach on Spelljammer Nexus level. All personnel, be prepared for supernatural anomalies." |
| 8 | Two sailors walk past, discussing how even in spite of recent improvements, three out of ten exploratory fleet missions still result in all hands lost. |
^academy-events

### Academy Locations

The following descriptions are keyed to locations noted on the Spelljammer Academy map.

#### Administration

_Security Level: Green (Visitor Rank) or Above, Purple (Officer Rank) or Above for the Record Room_

Administration occupies the level above the Sea Dock. It includes a visitors' lounge with a bar, guest rooms for visiting off-world dignitaries, and the academy reception. A record room requires purple-level security to enter and contains paperwork on all academy personnel.

##### Orientation Task: Welcome Pack

Characters can visit reception to collect their cadet-issue welcome packs from a thri-kreen named Sor'kur. Each pack includes the following gear:

- A red-level cadet uniform (plus spare), and a toiletry bag
- A 50 gp requisition voucher to spend at the academy stores
- A blue-level security helmet for visiting the Sky Dock during orientation

As the equipment is issued, staff members at reception give the new cadets a rundown on the academy's security protocols (see "Exploring the Academy" above).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Sor'kur
> 
> _Thri-kreen Receptionist_
> 
> The thri-kreen receptionist Sor'kur (pronounced SOAR-ker) is always busy, and there's no one better suited for the job. Whether she's sorting mail, passing messages, asking requests for assistance via several [sending stones](/compendium/items/sending-stones.md), or handing out welcome packs to new recruits, her multiple arms make it all look easy. Sor'kur has white chitin mottled with patches of brilliant blue, and matching blue eyes.
> 
> **Quote**: "Academy accounts payable, Sor'kur speaking, please hold."
^01b

#### Bridge Quarters

_Security Level: Gold (Bridge Rank) Only_

These opulent chambers are home to the Bridge—the high-ranking officers who run Spelljammer Academy. In addition to the officers' quarters, this level contains a private banqueting chamber, a library of spellbooks, and a magical communication chamber known as an oracularium. Characters visit the Bridge Quarters in part 3 of this adventure.

#### Cadet Quarters

_Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) or Above_

This area contains a dormitory for cadets and a smaller dorm for academy graduates, the Weeping Goddess tavern (a raucous bar that serves cadets), a refectory where cadets take their meals (complete with patio dining), washrooms, the academy kitchens, and the laundry.

##### Orientation Task: Bunk Assignment

On the characters' arrival, a giff duty officer assigns a bunk to each cadet and tells them to store their gear in their footlocker. As the characters claim their bunks, one character of your choice discovers that they've been assigned an airy bunk next to a window, near the laundry. As that character walks over to drop off their gear, four cadets march toward them. One of those cadets—a confident-looking moon elf—hurls her kit bag onto the bunk before the character can get there.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Change of plan, greenie. This bunk's mine now. Go tell the duty officer it wasn't to your liking, and we'll get ourselves swapped over. Tell him you've traded bunks with Veena."
> 
> The elf points to an unkempt bunk in the noisiest section of the dorm, just outside the washrooms.
^01f

Veena is testing the new cadets. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check can scare her and her friends away. Otherwise, the arrogant cadets are more than willing to use force to teach the upstart characters who's boss. Give "inspiration" to any character who overcomes the situation without resorting to violence.

Veena and the other cadets use the [bandit](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) stat block but carry no weapons. Instead, they make unarmed attacks (+3 to hit, 2 bludgeoning damage on a hit). Anyone reduced to 0 hit points by such attacks is knocked [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 5 minutes but doesn't make death saving throws. Veena and her friends flee if they take 2 or more damage in total.

#### Gymnasium

_Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) or Above_

The Gymnasium features a magically powered arena that can be reconfigured for a variety of training exercises. For the induction of new recruits, it is set up for a standard cadet training course.

##### Orientation Task: Obstacle Course

Each cadet must complete the obstacle course by making ability checks or saving throws to overcome the following obstacles in order:

- Make a straight dash while targeted by loud illusory explosions, requiring a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw.
- Leap across levitating platforms over pools of electrified water, requiring a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check.
- Swing from ropes through a spinning wheel of maces, requiring a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.
- Climb a slippery pole and ring a gong at the top, requiring a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

Roll initiative to determine the order of play. In each stage in the course, a character must succeed on the indicated ability check or saving throw to overcome the obstacle and move on. A character who fails remains where they are and can try again next turn. If they fail by 5 or more, they also take 2 damage of a type you choose, consistent with the test—lightning damage for the water pools, thunder damage for the explosions, and so forth.

Any character reduced to 0 hit points during the obstacle course falls [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) and must sit out the remainder of the event. Give inspiration to any character who successfully completes the course.

#### Sea Dock

_Security Level: Green (Visitor Rank) or Above, Blue (Sailor Rank) or Above for the Cargo Area_

This expansive sea cave contains berths for oceangoing vessels, animal pens for livestock, a dry dock for ship repairs, and a blue-level restricted area for cargo storage. New recruits arriving at the Sea Dock are guided to reception on the Administration level.

#### Simulations Deck

_Security Level: Green (Visitor Rank) or Above, Purple (Officer Rank) or Above for the Officers' Mess_

The Simulations Deck features a circular main hall leading to three magical simulation chambers. Each simulation chamber is a large circular space with a domed ceiling and arcane runes carved into its stonework. Using preset command words, an officer in uniform can create a variety of simulations within any one of these chambers, filling it with an illusory scene that affects the five senses.

Boatswain Tarto is present here throughout the day as the characters attempt to complete their orientation tasks, running other cadets through a variety of training programs. Characters can report back to her after completing their orientation tasks (see "Reporting to Tarto" below).

An officer's mess on this level requires purple-level security or higher to enter. The mess is where instructors and other officers of the academy have their meals.

#### Sky Dock

_Security Level: Blue (Sailor Rank) and Above_

Spelljamming ships frequently dock at the summit of the academy. Most vessels are assigned to the Spelljammer Academy, but some are independent merchant vessels delivering supplies.

Security guards at the stairs leading to the Sky Dock challenge anyone trying to enter this area without proper authorization (see "Exploring the Academy"). The characters must be wearing the blue security helmets included in their welcome packs (see "Administration") to access this area.

##### Orientation Task: Ship Inspection

Twin gnome officers named Kip and Pik show the characters around a spelljamming ship, teaching them the basic operations of the vessel and explaining how equipment should be handled.

##### One Good Turn

At some point during the inspection, have each character make a Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Whoever rolls the highest notices a suspicious event. On a nearby dock, a hobgoblin academy officer supervising the unloading of a merchant ship surreptitiously slips the merchant a platinum piece. In return, the merchant hands the hobgoblin a small bottle, which the officer conceals in his pocket. It is up to the characters to act on this information or ignore it.

If the characters report the officer (who you can name as you wish), the hobgoblin is challenged and gives up the bottle, which holds fine Yggdrasil Garden Rum. The officer is consigned to the brig for violation of customs charges—but the characters later learn that he is beloved among the graduate sailors. A sniff of rum is the officer's off-the-books reward for each sailor who returns alive from a mission into Wildspace. In bringing the officer into disrepute, the characters have surely earned some enemies! Have the players note this outcome for future adventures.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Kip and Pik Whistleslap
> 
> _Gnome Inspectors_
> 
> When nit-picking inane details, four eyes are better than two—something that Kip and Pik Whistleslap make abundantly clear. The two gnome ship inspectors wear meticulously maintained uniforms and the most-feared white gloves in the academy. Both have walnut-colored skin and carefully groomed long black hair, kept in tidy buns. Kip is well known for his no-nonsense attitude, which is complemented by his sister Pik's quick-witted jovialness. Pik has a red scar down one cheek—a stern reminder of an inspection gone wrong.
> 
> - **Quirk.** Kip and Pik often finish one another's sentences, a trait that others sometimes find unnerving.
^027

#### Spelljammer Nexus

_Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) and Above_

The Spelljammer Nexus is the exclusive training area for Spelljammer cadets. It contains a laboratory, a library of navigational and astronautical references, a chart room, and the nexus itself, which is a large chamber containing eight training _spelljamming helms_—ornate, high-backed chairs mounted onto mechanical gimbals that encircle a thirty-foot-high orrery depicting Realmspace.

Those who train here are overseen by Saerthe Abizjn, a training officer (see the accompanying sidebar). Only Spelljammer cadets are permitted entry to the nexus, though Spelljammer Corps cadets can observe their training from the viewing gallery.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Saerthe Abizjn (Spelljammer Training Officer)
> 
> _Human Spelljammer_
> 
> Despite their extravagant showboating, Saerthe Abizjn (pronounced SAIR-th ah-bih-ZEEN) remains as mysterious as the isle of Nimbral from which they hail. Although relatively inexperienced in comparison to some of the other instructors at the academy, Saerthe is an experienced spelljammer. Their eyes shimmer like pools of quicksilver, allowing them to see magical auras.
> 
> Saerthe's quick wit and sharp tongue provide them with an inexhaustible supply of jabs and quips (though never mean-spirited), accompanied to great effect by their natural talent with illusory magic. Saerthe's white skin is so pale as to be almost translucent, and their blonde hair is worn in a fashionable, immaculately manicured pompadour.
> 
> **Quote**: "I make talent look good."
^029

##### Orientation Task: Basic Training

Saerthe teaches Spelljammer cadets how to operate the training helms and guide the movement of miniature test ships, which move mechanically through the orrery as it spins. To complete their training, each Spelljammer cadet must use their helm to complete a Realmspace journey with their test vessel.

Issuing commands through a _spelljamming helm_ is a strange sensation: more akin to thinking about moving a limb than operating controls. No ability checks are required here, but Saerthe asks each character involved in a training session one of the following questions:

- "What life event in your past drove you to live in this moment, right now?"
- "Tell me where you wish to be one year hence. What shall the cosmos make of you?"
- "Something inside your mind holds you back. What is it? Speak, or it may just poison your ability to fly."
- "Tell me honestly—who among your friends and fellow cadets do you most respect?"
- "Where did you come from? I sense a great destiny inside you, yearning for release."
- "Tell me a tale of your past. What should I know of you?"

Award each character "inspiration" once they've all answered the questions.

#### Stores

_Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) and Above_

The academy's storerooms contain basic equipment, rations, and an extensive armory. Most academy personnel aren't allowed past the storefront, where quartermaster Mister Blip allocates supplies through a barred window.

##### Orientation Task: Collect Service Weaponry

Upon arrival, each corps cadet is assigned a simple or martial weapon of their choice. Cadets can also spend their 50 gp requisition voucher to purchase additional equipment from any of the following sources:

- The "Armor", "Weapons", "Adventuring Gear", or "Tools" tables in chapter 5 of the "Player's Handbook"
- The "Equipment Packs sidebar" in chapter 5 of the "Player's Handbook"

No change is given for purchases, so that if a character doesn't spend the full 50 gp, any gold left on their voucher is lost.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Mister Blip (Academy Quartermaster)
> 
> _Autognome Quartermaster_
> 
> Mister Blip is an odd but well-loved member of Spelljammer Academy. During a ship attack some years ago, the autognome's creator was slain and his memories were lost. With no purpose to speak of, Mister Blip wandered aimlessly, and eventually encountered Boatswain Tarto in her travels. The hadozee invited the autognome to Spelljammer Academy, and he's been there ever since.

> Mister Blip is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge on all subjects related to spelljamming. Chances are if you have a question, he's got a dozen different answers for it—and usually doesn't stop opining until asked to be quiet. His quarters are an absolute mess, featuring half a dozen tables piled high with tomes, curiosities, and devices of unknown purpose.

The color of his eyes changes depending on his mood: green if he's feeling inquisitive, blue when determined, red for angry, yellow when excited, and pink if he's proud, among others. A long, smartly crafted bronze mustache completes his ensemble.

### Reporting to Tarto

Once all orientation tasks are complete, the characters can report back to Boatswain Tarto. One character of the players' choosing must deliver a spoken report of their orientation. If they perform well, give this character inspiration.

#### The Last Task

After hearing the report, Tarto informs the group that there's one last task they must perform before they're dismissed for lunch. A spelljamming trader has delivered a fresh shipment of supplies to the academy, including a crate addressed to the academy head, Mirt the Merciless—also known as the Old Wolf.

Tarto gives each character a gold security helmet, then orders the characters to deliver the crate to Mirt's room in the Bridge Quarters. She explains that the Old Wolf was up late entertaining visiting dignitaries from the Rock of Bral and is feeling more than a little worse for wear. As such, the characters should keep the noise to a respectable level.

The characters' mission has two directives:

- Avoid damaging or tampering with the crate in any way.
- Obey Mirt's orders to the letter.

If the characters carry the crate to Mirt's room, proceed to part 3. The guards at the Bridge quarters nonchalantly wave them past as long as they're wearing the gold security helmets. Once the delivery has been made, the characters can retire for lunch.

##### Shipping Crate

The wooden shipping crate is about two feet on a side and bears a large label that reads "For Mirt." It weighs roughly 100 pounds. One strong character can carry it awkwardly, or two characters can carry it easily.

Unknown to anyone at the academy, the crate secretly contains a number of hungry [neogi hatchlings](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/neogi-hatchling-mpmm.md). If the characters open the crate or otherwise find a way to divine its contents before visiting Mirt's quarters, you'll need to refer to part 3 for guidance. At your determination, the hatchlings can also gnaw their way out of the crate at any time that feels dramatically appropriate.

## Part 3: Intruder Alert!

While fulfilling the orders given to them by Boatswain Tarto, the characters meet Mirt the Merciless and discover that someone has sent the head of Spelljammer Academy a most deadly gift.

### Mirt's Quarters

On arrival at the door to Mirt's quarters, the characters hear loud snoring within. (Feel free to give the players your best snoring impression.) Knocking or pushing on the door reveals that it's partly ajar and causes it to creak open. Read or paraphrase the following if the characters peer inside:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Mirt's quarters are sumptuously decorated with velvet curtains, gold fittings, and oak panels. A cauldron-sized fishbowl stands along one wall, filled with squirming octopuses. On the opposite wall, a table bears a topographic map of the Sword Coast. Nearer the door, a walk-in wardrobe stands partly open, golden light spilling out from within.
> 
> Peering in, you see the Old Wolf himself, sprawled over a giant, leathery bed—and snoring loudly.
^033

#### Fishbowl

The fishbowl contains a number of tiny harmless octopuses. If the bowl is broken (it has AC 5, 2 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage), each creature within 5 feet of the tank is knocked [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) and soaked through by the sudden outflow of water.

#### Topographic Map

Close inspection of the map on the table reveals that it is set with tiny figurines representing troops. The figurines magically animate whenever a creature moves within 5 feet of the table, playing out a mock battle between giants and dragons. Disturbing the battle is dangerous, though. Anyone who touches the table or a figurine is targeted by tiny catapults (+4 to hit; 3 bludgeoning damage on a hit). After making three such attacks, the catapults run out of ammunition.

#### Walk-In Wardrobe

This magical wardrobe ensures that Mirt always looks resplendent for his duties. Any creature that enters the wardrobe is sucked into an extradimensional space and removed from play until start of its next turn, when it emerges from the wardrobe having been treated to a full makeover, featuring fresh makeup and perfume, coiffured hair, and pressed clothes. The process is invigorating, and any creature that undertakes it while injured is restored to full hit points.

#### Waterbed

Mirt's leathery bed shifts and rocks, and close inspection reveals that it's filled with water. If the waterbed is damaged (it has AC 5, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage), each creature within 5 feet of it is knocked [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) and soaked through by the sudden outflow of water.

### Opening the Crate

When Mirt gets any sense of the characters' presence, he opens a single bloodshot eye and speaks:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Uuuurgh... by Ilmater's buttocks, mah head is explodin'! If ye've come to drop off that thing, just put it on the rug there, open it as quietly as ye can, and let me die in peace."
^039

At that point, the characters hear a strange thump from within the crate.

If Mirt is asked about the crate, he has no idea who it's from or what's inside. He impatiently demands that the cadets open it up before he regurgitates last night's dinner, which he has no memory of eating.

When the characters open the crate, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> As you open the crate's lid, a cacophony of high-pitched squeals emanates from within. Grotesque creatures scuttle into the light: ugly cat-sized monsters with hairy, spiderlike bodies and eel-like heads. Mirt yelps in shock, tumbles from his bed, and lands heavily on the floor, dragging his bedcovers with him.
^03a

#### Dealing with the Hatchlings

Eight [neogi hatchlings](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/neogi-hatchling-mpmm.md) emerge from hiding inside the crate, positioning themselves around it before combat begins. Each round, the hatchlings attack any characters they can reach. As Tiny creatures, two hatchlings can occupy a single 5-foot space if needed.

Due to his hungover state, Mirt is unlikely to participate in this combat (see "Mirt's Rude Awakening" below). He is a high-level character and won't be at risk here, so no stats are required for him.

#### Mirt's Rude Awakening

Even on the best of days, Mirt requires a remarkable amount of time to rise from his bed. Though energized by the imminent threat of death, it takes the Old Wolf a full 30 seconds (5 rounds) to mobilize his hungover body. Each turn on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), update the players on Mirt's situation using the relevant entry from the table below. If any hatchlings remain alive after 6 rounds, Mirt swiftly skewers them with his rapier and brings the combat to an end.

| Round | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | Mirt rolls about on the floor, trying to unravel himself from the bedcovers. |
| 2 | Mirt hops around in his underwear, trying to pull on his breeches. |
| 3 | Mirt rushes for his belt and rapier, but his breeches slip down on route and send him sprawling. |
| 4 | Breeches around his ankles, Mirt crawls on all fours for his belt and rapier. |
| 5 | Mirt pulls on his belt and breeches, with much huffing and puffing. |
| 6 | Mirt pulls his blade from its scabbard and shouts "Ha!"—then accidentally yanks his belt off in the process, causing his breeches to slip down again. |
^round-behavior

#### Aftermath

The sound of battle in Mirt's quarters alerts the guards just as the fight is winding down. As the last hatchlings expire, the characters hear alarms sounding throughout the Bridge Quarters, followed by the thunder of booted feet as security forces converge on Mirt's room.

Mirt is furious! Who dares to try to have him killed? His day is ruined! He swears that heads will roll once he's found out who's behind this outrage. As Mirt is blowing off steam, Mister Blip appears at the door:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> It's difficult to tell, but the autognome looks worried. His bronze mustache hangs lower than usual, and his mechanical eyes have sunken in their sockets.
> 
> "With regret, Master Mirt, this attack was merely a diversion. While our forces were being drawn here, more burglaries were reported across the academy. Our thief has struck again!"
^03e

#### Treasure

Once all the excitement has subsided, Mirt breathlessly fishes around in a nearby backpack and draws forth a pouch, from which he digs out a handful of golden ingots. He tosses an ingot (worth 50 gp) to each of the characters with slightly winded thanks, and a murmured plea for their discretion regarding his state before and during the fight.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Mirt the Merciless (Academy Head)
> 
> _Human Adventurer (Retired) and Head of Spelljammer Academy_
> 
> Mirt was a loudmouthed rogue with a reputation as an adventurer and philanderer. The Old Wolf rose to serve as one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep and became a close advisor to Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep. The extensive wealth he squirreled away as a politician ultimately forced him to flee the city and seek refuge far to the south. Mirt enjoys the finer things in life but remains stout of heart and quick with a sword.
