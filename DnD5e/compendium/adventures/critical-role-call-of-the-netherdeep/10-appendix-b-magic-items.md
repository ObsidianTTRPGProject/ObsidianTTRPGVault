# Appendix B: Magic Items
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep* 

Items imbued with magic are the stuff of song and legend across Exandria. Many of the magic items that the characters can find in this adventure are described in this appendix. Some of these items are medals that the characters can win during the Festival of Merit (see chapter 1), while others are obtainable only by joining a faction (see chapter 4).

## Ruidium Items

Ruidium is linked to the Apotheon, channeling not just Alyxian's distorted emotions but also the curse of misfortune bestowed upon him by the moon Ruidus. Though it is a source of magical power, ruidium corrupts everything it touches. Even magic items can be corrupted by ruidium, and using such items comes with a risk.

Weapons and armor can be transformed into ruidium items by infusing them with powdered ruidium, which gives these items a rusty-red coloration. Other items can be transformed into ruidium items after prolonged contact with the mineral; such items have ruidium crystals embedded in them or veins of ruidium running through them.

## Magic Item Descriptions

The magic items in this section are presented in alphabetical order. For the rules on "magic items", see the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

> [!quote] Vestiges of Divergence
> 
> When the great wars of the Calamity rolled across Exandria, heroes of divinity accepted legendary relics from their patrons and gods. At the same time, archmages wove dangerous arcane power into items of immense magical might. When the war ended, most of these magic items were buried with their wielders beneath ash and dust. Those items that remained accessible were passed down as heirlooms. These remnants of a lost era are known as the Vestiges of Divergence.
> 
> Each Vestige of Divergence is a magic item that grows in power over time. When it is first encountered, the item is usually in its Dormant State. Either on its own or in response to the heroic deeds of its bearer, a Vestige of Divergence can enter its Awakened State. In time, it can reach its ultimate potential and enter its Exalted State, usually in response to a momentous event or some heroic achievement on the part of its bearer. The properties gained at each new state are cumulative with the properties of a previous state, unless otherwise noted.
