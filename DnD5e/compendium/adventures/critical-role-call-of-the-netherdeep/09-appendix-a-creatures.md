# Appendix A: Creatures
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep* 

This appendix provides descriptions and stat blocks for several creatures that appear in the adventure. Use them in adventures of your own creation, whether those tales are set in the world of Exandria or elsewhere in the D&D multiverse.

The creatures are organized alphabetically.

## Using a Stat Block

If you are unfamiliar with the monster stat block format, read the "introduction" of the "Monster Manual" before proceeding further. That book explains stat block terminology and gives rules for various monster traits—information that isn't repeated here.

### Unusual Attacks and Magic

Some creatures have weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in atypical ways. Such an exception is a special feature of a stat block and represents how the creature uses the weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or spell functions for another creature.

### Meeting Magic Item Prerequisites

If a stat block contains the name of a class in parentheses under the creature's name, the creature is considered a member of that class for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for magic items.

## Adventuring Rivals

The following nonplayer characters, their personalities, and their motivations are detailed in the introduction:

**Ayo Jabe** is a water genasi and a natural-born leader who was born to orc parents during a fierce storm at sea.

**Dermot Wurder** is a goblin priest who worships the Luxon, a divine entity of light and rebirth.

**Galsariad Ardyth** is a drow mage from the Kryn Dynasty who studies the esoteric practice of dunamancy.

**Irvan Wastewalker** is a young man who has experienced a previous life as a bugbear of the Kryn Dynasty. He was reborn as a nomadic human through the power of the Luxon.

**Maggie Keeneyes** is an ogre fighter who has a sharp intellect and a mind for tactics that complements her brute strength.

### Rival Tiers

Just as the characters advance in level and gain new equipment over the course of this adventure, so do the rivals increase in power. Each rival is represented by three stat blocks.

### Rivals' Battle Chatter

The Battle Chatter table gives examples of things the rivals might say in combat, either to each other or to the characters. These lines of dialogue fit their bright-eyed outlook early in the adventure; you can make up new lines as they grow and change.

**Battle Chatter**

| Rival | Sample Quotes |
|-------|---------------|
| Ayo | "Okay team, they're off-balance. Rally!" "Have you had enough?" "Yeah, just give up. You're finished." |
| Dermot | "I'm here to make sure no one dies. Back off!" "The Luxon will protect me." "Ayo, Maggie, I could use a little help here!" |
| Galsariad | "You have much to learn." "And here I thought you possessed some talent." "With this next incantation, I shall pluck any hope of victory from your mind." |
| Irvan | "Heh, that was a good hit, wasn't it?" "Come on, come on! Eyes on me!" "Can I have this dance? No?" |
| Maggie | "That was quite a blunder." "You're lucky I'm feeling merciful." "Fight smarter—and harder." "People don't win fights by fighting fair." |

### Tier 1 Rivals

The tier 1 rivals are fledgling adventurers who have gained a modicum of power through their individual exploits before the beginning of this story. They are seeking to write a grand tale of their own.

### Tier 2 Rivals

The tier 2 rivals are learning that their adventures take them into horrific places that will test their mettle, but they face these challenges with heads held high.

### Tier 3 Rivals

Their journey has forced the tier 3 rivals to make decisions, sometimes out of grim necessity, that they might have not made earlier. All five suffer from ruidium corruption (see "Ruidium" in the introduction). When the characters encounter them, assume that the rivals have removed all levels of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) from themselves through rest or magic, but the other effects of ruidium corruption remain.

If instead you want to weaken the rivals to make them less of a physical threat or reinforce the danger of ruidium corruption, you can give one or more of the rivals 1d4 levels of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) each. In this case, you'll need to keep track of each rival's [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level and the condition's corresponding effects (see "[Exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion)" in the "Player's Handbook").

#### Useful Magic

To facilitate their efforts, Galsariad has learned the [water breathing](/compendium/spells/water-breathing.md) spell. Additionally, all the rivals have acquired ruidium equipment to protect them from the effects of underwater pressure.

#### Irvan's Prosthetic Arm

During a misadventure that unfolded while the rivals were apart from the characters, Irvan Wastewalker lost an arm and gained an arcane prosthetic. This magic item functions for no one else.
