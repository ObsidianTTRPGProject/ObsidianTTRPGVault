# Thunder Cliffs
*Source: Essentials Kit: Storm Lord's Wrath* 

"Thunder Cliffs" is balanced for characters of 8th level, though characters of 7th level should be able to survive the encounters.

## Location Overview

The Thunder Cliffs were named by the people in the area for the sounds that the surf makes as it crashes into this high bluff overlooking the Sea of Swords. The Cliffs rest along the coastline halfway between the Mere of Dead Men and the city of Neverwinter.

The caves at the base of the Thunder Cliffs were once a haven for pirates, smugglers, and legitimate seafaring vessels looking for a safe place to wait out coastal storms. The shore there is inaccessible except by sea, making it the perfect haven for sea travelers.

Unfortunately, the Cult of Talos decided to use the caves of the Thunder Cliffs as a base of operations in the area, turning the place into a graveyard for ships and sailors alike. The anchorites used magic to install dangerous reefs in the area, proving deadly to vessels traveling the coast.

Now the cultists of Talos collect the goods from the wrecked ships to fund their operation. They imprison survivors from the wrecks to sell as slaves, to die in the twisted rites that honor their violent god, or to feed the monsters that share the caves with them.

### Quest Goals

To complete the Thunder Cliffs quest (see "Leilon Quests"), the adventurers must find passage to the caves of the Thunder Cliffs, navigate the deadly waters, make it to shore when their transportation goes awry, and then clear the caves of the dangers there.

## Travel to the Cliffs

Using the map found in the quest "Foul Weather at Wayside" and the magical lenses found in the quest "Aid from Phandalin," the adventurers should understand that the hub of cultist activity in the area is located at the Thunder Cliffs.

Valdi Estapaar is the best person in Leilon to counsel the characters on finding passage to the Thunder Cliffs. Use the bullet points below to guide that conversation:

- The fishing boats used by the fishing fleet of Leilon are not capable of making the trip to the Thunder Cliffs. The seas have been too rough, and the waves on the open ocean would crush the smaller fishing vessels. However, the town of Leilon will pay for the characters' passage on another vessel.
- Valdi can, however, use her knowledge of the seafarers in the area to find them some possible people who could take them to the Thunder Cliffs. The area at the base of the Thunder Cliffs, once you reach it, is known for being peaceful and welcoming to vessels.
- She has two vessels and captains in mind who frequently travel along the Sword Coast, transporting goods on behalf of merchants, as well as carrying travelers. Both are trustworthy and should be traveling toward the Thunder Cliffs within the next tenday.
- The first is Stands in Tar, a jovial if slightly off-kilter tabaxi. She is known for her recklessness, but her daring has also earned her a reputation for being able to do the impossible. Her corsair ({@vehicle sailing ship}), the Dancing Delight, is fast and agile.
- The other is Kristoffen, a white dragonborn. He is calculating, efficient, and somber. He captains a {@vehicle galley} called the Ice Floe, which is specially outfitted to break through the icy waters of the far north.

### Meeting the Captains

Within a few days, the two captains arrive via {@vehicle rowboat} through the marsh to talk to the party. Their vessels are anchored out at sea, awaiting the party if they are selected as the method of conveyance.

#### The Interview

Valdi Estapaar brings the tabaxi Stands in Tar and the dragonborn Kristoffen before the characters to allow them to ask questions of the two captains. They each plead their case for being the best ship and crew for the job.

Stands in Tar staggers slightly as she stands. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check reveals that the tabaxi has been in the rum-soaked catnip and is not totally sober. She does, however, plead her case eloquently. Her ship is faster and more agile, and her crew smaller and less likely to gossip about their mission. There isn't a ship on the sea that the _Dancing Delight_ can't outmaneuver or outrun on the open ocean.

Kristoffen looks at Stands in Tar with a mixture of disgust and horror, shaking his head in disbelief that anyone would even consider choosing the drunken tabaxi and her ship over him and his. He explains to the party that his ship is more reliable and safer, which they might need on the seas that have become more violent of late. He goes on to reveal that he's heard rumors that the once-safe caves at the base of the Thunder Cliffs have recently become more dangerous. Stand in Tar scoffs at that idea.

#### A Secret Agent

Feel free to roleplay the interactions here as much or as little as you are comfortable. If the characters ask to get a read on the attitudes of the two captains, Stands in Tar is pretty much as advertised: competent but foolhardy, experienced but overly confident.

Kristoffen, on the other hand, is hiding something. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check, a character can sense that the dragonborn is nervous and hiding something. If confronted, he says that he just has a bad feeling about traveling to the Thunder Cliffs, but he is willing to do so for the payment and the friendship he shares with Valdi Estapaar.

Kristoffen has recently been converted into the Cult of Talos. There is no evidence of this on his person, but back on the Ice Floe the characters might find some if they snoop in his quarters.

### A Decision

At some point, the characters must decide which vessel and captain they prefer. The town covers the cost of passage there and back for the characters, and both captains ask the same fare, so that should not enter into the decision.

Whomever the party chooses is pleased, and the other captain simply accepts the decision and walks away. They are both ready to go as soon as the characters are.

If for any reason the characters attack Kristoffen because they learn of his affiliation with the Cult of Talos, he defends himself. Kristoffen (use [half-red dragon veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/half-red-dragon-veteran.md) statistics but replace fire with cold in attacks and resistances) can summon a pair of [air elementals](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) that serve him on behalf of Talos, which appear at the end of the first round of combat.

## Encounters on the Way

The characters have the following encounters as they travel to the Thunder Cliffs. The encounters may play slightly differently depending on the vessel and captain that the party chose.

### Mutinous Intentions

Regardless of which vessel the characters choose, some of the crew have their own intentions and are dissatisfied with the leadership of their captain.

The crew of the _Ice Floe_ is unhappy because their captain has been acting differently within the last couple of months. He has turned down more lucrative contracts to sail northwest to the Moonshae Isles in order to stay closer to Neverwinter. This has meant less pay for the crew, which they are not pleased about.

The crew of the _Dancing Delight_ is unhappy because their captain has been even more reckless and unpredictable than usual, causing them to lose pay, since merchants have begun to eschew using Stand in Tar's ship and crew for important and profitable jobs.

### The Moment of Truth

A day into the journey, after the party has heard some grumbling among the sailors, the crew confronts the captain. Regardless of the vessel, the mutiny is led by Castisha (female Calishite [swashbuckler](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/swashbuckler-mpmm.md); see appendix A), the first mate. She is backed by four sailors ([bandits](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)) per character, excluding sidekicks.

The captain (of either ship) refuses to turn over control of the ship peacefully. Castisha offers to let the captain get into a dingy and go ashore safely, but if they don't go peacefully, the mutineers are willing to do it the hard way. The mutineers make it clear they will not hurt the party and will honor the contract that was agreed upon.

#### Allow the Mutiny

Without the characters' help, neither captain can defeat the mutineers. If the adventurers do nothing, the mutiny succeeds.

#### Talk

The adventurers may attempt to speak on behalf of the captain, hoping to talk the mutineers out of their plans. Castisha has already made up her mind, and nothing short of magical compulsion can get her to back down. The rest of the mutineers, however, are willing to listen to reasons why they shouldn't overthrow their captain. Set the DC for succeeding at 15, and then adjust based on the tactics the characters use.

For example, if one of the characters shoots a fireball into the sky to intimidate the sailors into standing down, the Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check to cow the sailors might just be DC 10, or it might even succeed automatically.

#### Fight

The adventurers are much more powerful than the sailors, even though they are outnumbered. If the characters defeat at least half the sailors, or Castisha and a quarter of the sailors, the mutiny ceases immediately.

### Bad News

As the party's ship sails north toward the Thunder Cliffs, a southward-sailing vessel approaches them. The ships drop anchor and the captain of the other vessel, called the _Uneasy Alliance_, comes aboard the ship.

This captain, a human named Captain Starling Winchet, trades stories and ale with the captain and crew of the characters' ship. She tells a tale that is of particular interest to the adventurers. While the _Uneasy Alliance_ was passing near the Thunder Cliffs, they spotted a great deal of wreckage, which likely came from the waters directly before the caves there. They did see any survivors or salvageable wreckage, so they steered very clear of the area.

Captain Winchet also relays that she's heard other sailors talking about seeing a ghost ship in this area recently. The ship is only seen from a distance, but it is as hazy as the smoke from a cannon and emits a low moaning sound that carries across the water. She hasn't personally seen the ghost ship, but she feels obligated to pass along the information.

### Ghost Ship

As the party's ship gets closer to the Thunder Cliffs, the spectral ship that the characters heard about approaches. Use the following read-aloud text to set the scene:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The skies darken and a thick mist rises from the water, obscuring sight around the ship. The crew swears and make superstitious signs. Then, from the crow's nest, a voice screams, "Ghost ship ahead." Before the words can even register, spectral figures emerge from the mist, swooping up onto the decks.
^0d6

One [allip](/compendium/bestiary/undead/allip-mpmm.md) per three adventurers (rounded down) and two [specters](/compendium/bestiary/undead/specter.md) per character, excluding sidekicks, use the cover of the mist to approach the ship. The allip's howling babble instantly stuns everyone on the ship except the adventurers, as the crew collapses in a heap. Even if they get up during the battle, the sailors are terrified and do nothing but flee and cower under the undead assault.

While the allips attack, the characters can understand a few snippets of recognizable words in their babbling, including "we know of the ruinstone... that never happens" and "the Ebondeath rises but cannot fly" and "the bronze points the way to the green."

> [!quote] The Sea Less Traveled
> 
> The adventure assumes that the characters access the caves of the Thunder Cliffs via the sea. Reaching the caves via the top of the Thunder Cliffs would mean a dangerous trek through hostile territory, then a long climb (or fall) from the top of the cliffs to the surf below. Still, some players, as soon as you tell them they cannot do something, want to do just that. If they insist, let them.
> 
> The trek from Leilon to the Thunder Cliffs should trigger many encounters with undead creatures from the army of Ularan Mortus, random ogre and giant attacks, and confrontations with other hostile beasts, humanoids, and monsters.
> 
> The top of the cliffs is home to a tribe of Talos-worshipping aarakocra who act as a guard for the cult. Many will attack when the characters approach, but some will hang back and see what happens. If the characters succeed in defeating the group, the rest of the aarakocra pester the party as they try to climb down the 800-foot-high cliffs. And, of course, the [invisible stalker](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) and [manticores](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md) are always ready to attack intruders.
^the-sea-less-traveled

## Arrival

After the drama on the high seas, the party's transport finally arrives in the vicinity of the Thunder Peaks. The tops of the cliffs are visible for a great distance, long before the party can see the caves along the shoreline.

Heeding the words of Captain Winchet, the captain of the party's vessel drops anchor at least a mile offshore, telling the adventurers that the vessel cannot get any closer based on what they've learned on the trip. The characters are welcome to take a large rowboat the rest of the way. The ship will wait here until they return, or for five days, whichever comes first.

From here, the characters must either use the {@vehicle rowboat} attached to the ship (2-8 people can fit in and operate the boat) or find their own way to the shore.

### Threats by Air

As the adventurers set off toward the caves, guardians serving the cultists of Talos sense their presence and attack.

One [invisible stalker](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) flies down from the cliffs to attempt to upend the {@vehicle rowboat}. [Manticores](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md) (one per two characters, excluding sidekicks) follow from their perches in the cliff face.

#### Talos is Angry

The water and air, which have been relatively peaceful until now, suddenly turn violent as the party approaches shore. Jagged reefs magically spring up out of the water. The reefs can be avoided in the maneuverable {@vehicle rowboat}, but a larger ship would have been torn apart on the rocks.

Flying creatures not sent by Talos must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw at the start of each turn. On a failed save, severe winds drive them into the water.

Creatures in the water find the rough waves treacherous. Creatures without a swim speed must succeed on a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to take an action without going under. On a failed check, or if the creature takes an action without attempting the check, that creature begins to drown (see ""Suffocating"" in the "Player's Handbook").

### Sea Galley

The previous guardians are not the only creatures that protect the shore in the service of Talos. A [huge giant crab](/compendium/bestiary/beast/huge-giant-crab-tftyp.md) (see appendix A), or two crabs if there are more than four characters, including sidekicks, floats under the surface 200 feet from shore. It waits until a boat or swimming creatures pass above it, then it swims up and attacks, tipping over the boat if it is still in use. If creatures are flying, the crab waits until they land on shore, then rushes out to attack.

## Thunder Cliffs Caves

The caves at the base of the Thunder Cliffs, used by seafarers for centuries, are now controlled by the Cult of Talos. A tyrannical and supremely devout servant of Talos, Gadrille the Reef-Reaver, oversees the operations here. She's a trusted lieutenant of Fheralai Stormsworn, who knows that Gadrille isn't exactly stable, but her unswaying devotion to the cause of the Cult of Talos makes her a great and feared commander.

The map of the Thunder Cliffs Caves represents the cave system at low tide. The yellow parts of the map show the sandy areas that become flooded at high tide. The water-filled areas within the caves themselves are always there, flooded even at low tide.

The operation undertaken by the Cult of Talos here is not complicated. They lure unsuspecting ships close to the caves, wreck the ships on the magical reefs, capture the crew, and drag the wreckage into the caves. Anything worthwhile is salvaged and sold, and the prisoners are either sold to slavers or sacrificed to Talos.

With the gold earned through this terrible operation, the Cult of Talos funds operatives along the coast and the High Road, who (like the group at the Wayside Inn) hope to establish shrines that will eventually put the Cult of Talos in control of the area.

### 1. Unsure Shore

The shoreline, where the water meets the sandy beach, crashes with the breaking waves. The echoes formed within the caves reverberate back, filling the air with a sound like the crashing of thunder.

The shore is lined with thin wire treated with a modified version of the [alarm](/compendium/spells/alarm.md) spell. Water and other natural circumstances do not trigger the spell, but any humanoid creatures that trip the wires cause an alarm to sound within the caves, alerting the cultists that intruders are present.

The wires can be spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Getting to shore without tripping the wires is practically impossible, but the wires can be disarmed with a DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check, or the [alarm](/compendium/spells/alarm.md) spell can be suppressed for an hour using [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md).

### 2. Unhappy Cultists

If the characters are able to approach without tripping the alarm, they might hear some disgruntled cultists talking while they work. If the alarm was tripped, the cultists wait with weapons drawn and cannot be surprised.

If the adventurers get a chance to hear the cultists talking, use the following read-aloud text to portray that conversation:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A severely damaged ship leans against a ledge. Atop the ledge, a handful of workers offload crates, boxes, and barrels from the ship. They grumble and grouse about this menial labor, agreeing that they did not seek the power of the Stormlord to be forced into playing the part of glorified longshoremen.
^0df

The cultists here ([spies](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)) number two per character, including sidekicks.

#### A Better Offer?

The party could avoid a fight here if they understand the frustration of the cultists and go in immediately with a better offer. To get the dialogue started on a good note, one of the characters must approach the group and talk to them. A successful DC 15 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks convinces the disgruntled cultists to listen.

The party might also pretend to be other members of the cult who are seeking volunteers to do more exciting work elsewhere. They might offer to kill the current leader and put the workers in charge, or they might come up with a totally different plan.

Whatever the party's tactics allow the roleplaying to carry the encounter until it's time to resolve the situation. If the adventurers make a compelling offer to the cultists, they might do what the party wants with no check. If the outcome is uncertain, have the party make a final ability check to figure what happens. On a failure, the cultists attack.

#### Success!

On a success, however, the party now has a valuable resource. The cultists are unlikely to turn traitor completely and join the characters, but they might give the characters valuable information about who and what lives in the caves, where the important areas are, and anything else they might need to know.

### 3. Sea Hag Coven

In this cave, strategically separated from the rest of the complex, a coven of three sea hags carry out their own gruesome plans in alongside those of their anchorite allies.

#### Accessing the Cave

In order to access this cave, a creature must swim through a submerged tunnel teeming with scary-looking fish. The fish have strange glowing eyes and large teeth, but they are just normal fish that have been mutated through the magic of the hags, and they do not attack swimmers.

#### The Coven Cave

In the cave, three [sea hags](/compendium/bestiary/fey/sea-hag.md) chew on the hands and feet of sailors who drowned after being shipwrecked on the magical reefs. The cultists supply the bodies in return for help from the coven when dealing with special problems, and the two forces have an easy mutual-protection pact.

Piles of slimy seaweed act as beds for the three sisters: Nana Pocktuss, Auntie Unk, and Granny Muyuk. The trio is using the inedible parts of the bodies to create assistants that look like flying skulls with long stingers. There is one [skull flier](/compendium/bestiary/construct/skull-flier-slw.md) per character, excluding sidekicks. You can find the statistics for these creatures in Appendix A.

#### A Nice Chat

The coven does not attack immediately. They don't get many visitors who aren't boring anchorites or screaming victims, so they invite intruders in for a nice seaweed and squid ink cookie.

Auntie Unk is the newest member of the coven, and she spent her previous years kidnapping people off the High Road and dragging them into the Mere of Dead Men to eat. She misses news of the city and favors anyone who can provide gossip about Waterdeep or Neverwinter.

Nana Pocktuss likes to dance. If any of the characters can play music or dance themselves, Nana Pocktuss appreciates a grand old hoedown to shake the rust (and maggots) out of her old joints.

Granny Muyuk never could turn down a good (or even putrid) drop of grog. If any of the adventurers carry alcohol with them, regardless of its vintage or provenance, Granny Muyuk can smell it and asks for a taste. Those sharing generously earn her favor.

If all three of the hags can be placated by catering to to their particular vices and interests, they are willing to spare the characters a fight, and they might even look the other way as the characters attempt to end the dominance of the Cult of Talos at this location. And if not, they always enjoy a good fight as well.

### 4. The Dying Second

While the incredibly devout Gadrille the Reef-Reaver leads the group of cultists at the caves, Fheralai Stormsworn assigned a second-in-command to assist her—with special instructions to keep an eye on Gadrille to ensure she doesn't kill all her followers in a fit of mad devotion to Talos. That second-in-command is Sovendahl Erkinze, a [drow elite warrior](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/drow-elite-warrior.md).

Sovendahl's bodyguards ([thugs](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md)), numbering one per character, including sidekicks, stay with the drow no matter where he goes. And right now, he isn't going very far, because he is suffering from a curse.

Sovendahl's duties involve overseeing the sorting, transportation, and sales of the stolen goods that the rest of the operation steals from wrecked ships. This frees Gadrille do what she loves most: killing others in the name of Talos.

Recently, Sovendahl expressed opposition to some of Gadrille's more enthusiastic endeavors, deeming them too risky and likely to draw the attention of larger and more powerful forces, like the Waterdeep navy. Sovendahl went behind Gadrille's back and urged Fheralai Stormsworn to order Gadrille to stand down. The overzealous Gadrille did as she was told, but she secretly prayed to Talos, asking for a boon in payment for her years of devotion: curse Sovendahl for his cowardly caution. And Talos answered.

#### The Sick Room

When the characters encounter Sovendahl, he is resting in his quarters His bodyguards sort through the latest haul of stolen and salvaged treasure. Occasionally the drow erupts in a coughing spasm that brings up blood from his lungs. He is worried but tries not to show it.

If combat breaks out here, Sovendahl fights bravely and expertly, but the exertion leads to more coughing. As the fight progresses, describe the drow's spasms of coughing, and blood spraying over the adventurers who face him. (That's something that can scare even the bravest barbarian!) The disease is not communicable, but no one has to know that.

If at any point the characters speak with the drow about his affliction, pointing out that he is sick and in need of assistance, the drow might stop fighting and ask the characters if they can help him. He is willing to walk away from the cult to obtain a cure.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check reveals that the ailment is not a disease, but a curse. A character who casts [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) on Sovendahl earns the drow's thanks. As a reward, the he gives the characters a magic item has been storing away: a [dagger of venom](/compendium/items/dagger-of-venom.md).

##### Treasure

If the characters kill Sovendahl and his bodyguards, they do not find the magical dagger, which is hidden carefully in a secret location outside the caves. They do, however, get 250 gp in various coins, 3 [potions of greater healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md), and a jade brooch worth 500 gp.

### 5. The Cultist's Quarters

The cultists of Talos working under Gadrille the Reef-Reaver don't get a lot of time for relaxation and socializing. They spend most of their time out on the sea, luring unsuspecting ships into the reef, then salvaging the wreckages. Gadrille's motto is "if you're not reavin' in service to Talos, you're sleepin' in service to Talos."

This area is where the cultists of the lowest standing sleep and eat. At any time, there are eight [scouts](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) here, sleeping in four bunk beds that line the walls, or eating their fish broth at the table in the center of the room before heading out to perform their tasks. The cultists here when the characters arrive are dedicated to their god and will not surrender or negotiate.

#### The Blowhole

In an alcove to the north of the room is a special feature that the occupants of the cave call "the blowhole." This vertical shaft runs both beneath the water and up into the cave ceiling.

When Gadrille believes a cultist is lacking the proper amount of faith to be a true servant of Talos, the cultist is dragged here and tossed into the water of the blowhole to be judged. Sometimes they are pulled down into the bottom of the shaft, sometimes a geyser of water blows them up through the top of the shaft, and sometimes nothing happens. If nothing happens, Gadrille takes that as a sign Talos approves.

The truth is that the blowhole is a magical portal. When a living creature enters the blowhole, roll a d10. On a 1-8, nothing happens. On a 9, the creature is pulled down into the shaft, through a portal, and appears moments later floating in Waterdeep Harbor, alive and well. On a 10, the creature is pushed up through the ceiling by the geyser. With a successful DC 10 Strength saving throw, a creature can grab onto the side of the shaft and avoid getting pushed through the portal. On a failure, the creature tumbles through a portal at the top of the shaft and ends up in the Elemental Plane of Water. (Perhaps a passing [marid](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/marid.md) takes pity on the creature and uses [plane shift](/compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) to return it home—for a price!)

The party can learn about the magic of the blowhole in a number of ways:

- One of the disgruntled anchorites tells the character about Gadrille's cruelty in dealing with those she deems unworthy.
- A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check of the area reveals scrape marks around the blowhole, where people have grabbed hold while attempting to keep from getting sent away.
- Characters succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) checks notices the magical emanations within the blowhole, revealing that it contains teleportation magic.
- A character steps into the blowhole and suffers the effects of the area.

### 6. Loot

This central chamber is where the loot to be sold or transported is packaged and stored. When ready, it's carried down to the shore, loaded onto ships operated by the Cult of Talos, and taken to its final destination.

When the characters arrive, there is no one here, but there are several closed crates awaiting transport. Most of the crates contain commercial goods like cloth, crafted goods, spices, and other trade items. Each of the crates is marked with chalk describing the contents. One of the crates, with a chalk marking that says "Gold," is trapped.

#### Trap

Sovendahl fears that some of the cultists might be stealing from the stockpiles of goods for sale, so he placed a crate here that might be tempting to a thief.

The crate marked "Gold" is full of rocks, and there are tiny runes on the edge of the lid, which can be noticed with a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. The runes can be deactivated with a [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell, or carefully filed away with a DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check.

If the crate is opened without deactivating the runes, it explodes. Any creature within 10 feet of the crate must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The creatures within the blast radius are also covered in green ink that only comes off with repeated scrubbing over the course of months.

##### Treasure

The rest of the crates here contain about 2000 gp worth of trade goods. However, they are heavy and unwieldy, requiring a good-sized ship to transport them all to a place where they could be sold.

### 7. Gadrille the Reef-Reaver

Gadrille the Reef-Reaver is a female half-elf [evoker](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/evoker-wizard-mpmm.md). She spends most of her time out with her followers, preying on those too weak to withstand the ravaging power of Talos. When in the caves, however, she is in her chambers praying.

Talos has rewarded Gadrille for her devotion with a pet, whom she calls "[Tooth-N-Claw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/tooth-n-claw-slw.md)." This beast uses [hell hound](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md) statistics but replace fire with cold in attacks and immunities. [Tooth-N-Claw](/compendium/bestiary/npc/tooth-n-claw-slw.md) is ferociously protective of Gadrille. If there are more than four characters, excluding sidekicks, add a second pet called "Frost-N-Fang."

#### Swirling Pool Chamber

In the center of this chamber is a large roiling boil of water. Gadrille likes to soak in it, feeling the power of Talos course through her when she does. If a creature not favored by Talos enters the pool or starts its turn there, it takes 4d10 psychic damage.

#### Shrine Chamber

This area is Gadrille's private shrine. In addition to the carved limestone likeness of Talos in one corner, the walls are carved with images of Talos's destructive power. Moving within the chamber is like moving through difficult terrain unless you are a worshipper of Talos. Taking an action to say a prayer to Talos and succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, allows a creature to move normally in the room for 1 minute.

##### Treasury

Gadrille stores her personal wealth here, including a chest with 300 gp, three ornate matching silver daggers worth a total of 500 gp, a [ring of warmth](/compendium/items/ring-of-warmth.md), a [wand of magic missiles](/compendium/items/wand-of-magic-missiles.md), and a [potion of vitality](/compendium/items/potion-of-vitality.md).

### Aftermath

If the characters can defeat Gadrille and her cultists' salvage operation, they have struck a great blow to the plans of the Cult of Talos in the immediate area. Plans to create shrines along the High Road are scrapped for the near future, and the heroes of Leilon can return to their new home for a well-deserved rest. And they'll need it, because evil, unlike them, never rests.
