## Description

Decay and despair are bound up in the nature of topaz dragons, thanks to the necrotic energy of the Negative Plane that suffuses them. Their psionic power manifests the fundamental entropic principle that mortal beings and their creations are ultimately doomed to death and decomposition, and the dragons' demeanor is typically morbid and curmudgeonly as a result.

**Gleaming Gold.** Upon hatching, topaz dragon wyrmlings' scales are dull yellow-orange and have a cloudy or filmy look. As they age, their scales harden and clarify, becoming translucent and faceted, and ranging from bright yellow to rich amber in color. Their bodies are wider at the haunches, tapering in a wedge shape toward the head, and their wings are shaped to propel them through both air and water. A topaz dragon's psionic power manifests visibly in the gem-like spines that run in a ridge from the crown of the head to the tip of the tail. These spines hover above a living topaz dragon's back, dancing and shifting with the dragon's mood.

**Embodiment of Decay.** While generally not malicious, topaz dragons embody decay. They view destruction as a natural means of clearing the way for new creation and growth, much as a forest fire clears dead wood, replenishes the soil, and allows the forest to regrow even healthier than before. To this end, topaz dragons use their power to reduce crumbling structures and diseased plants to dust, clearing the way for new growth and construction.

Despite being competent swimmers and making their lairs on seacoasts and in brackish marshes, topaz dragons hate the water. Unfortunately, their favorite food is giant squid, so these dragons have ample opportunity to complain bitterly about being wet after diving deep into the ocean in search of prey.

Topaz dragons often come into conflict with bronze dragons when their coastal territories overlap, and they can nurture an inexplicably intense hatred of these metallic dragons. They can also draw the ire of druids and other nature protectors who don't understand the dragons' proclivity for destroying large swaths of countryside. Beyond that, topaz dragons dislike company and grow irritated when disturbed. But anyone who can endure their abrasive demeanor, caustic observations, and morbid interests can form a lasting bond with a powerful ally.

**Entropic Hoards.** Topaz dragons prize information on destruction and creation, whether abstract or dedicated to practical applications. They are fascinated by magic that creates objects from nothing, animates Undead, destroys matter, or manipulates negative energy. And they are particularly intrigued by Undead, sometimes keeping them in their hoards as curios.

**Creating a Topaz Dragon.** Use the Topaz Dragon Personality Traits and Topaz Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive topaz dragon characters.

**Topaz Dragon Personality Traits.** | dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I seek no company other than my own, for no one else can compete with me. |
| 2 | If my offspring can't care for themselves, I'm not sure they're worthy of my attention. |
| 3 | The sea is beautiful and I love gazing upon it, but I abhor being wet. |
| 4 | Why should I risk damaging my splendid physique when I can fight with the power of my mind? |
| 5 | I am predictable only in my unpredictability. |
| 6 | It takes true artistry to maintain a warm, desert-like dwelling under the water. |
| 7 | I soothe myself to sleep by imagining the perfect insults for bronze dragons; while I wait to meet one, I hone them on other creatures. |
| 8 | I secretly enjoy conversing with lesser beings, although I usually do so only to find their weaknesses. |
^trait

**Topaz Dragon Ideals.** | dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Solitude. My own company obviates the need for others in my life, whether they are dragons or lesser creatures. (Any) |
| 2 | Change. Consistency is stagnation. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | Mental Superiority. I hone my mental powers so I can confuse, control, or kill any who annoy me. (Evil) |
| 4 | Territoriality. Any creature that comes into my territory has forfeited its right to be upset by anything I do to it. (Evil) |
| 5 | Wonder. Though I don't wish to spend time in it, my soul sings at the sight of the vast beauty of the ocean. (Good) |
| 6 | Code of Combat. I despise most other dragons, but I meet them face to face without resorting to the base trickery I use on lesser creatures. (Lawful) |

**Topaz Dragon Adventures.** The Topaz Dragon Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for stories and adventures involving topaz dragons.

**Topaz Dragon Adventure Hooks.** | dice: d8 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A pirate ship is found floating on the open sea, the bodies of the crew completely desiccated. The only clue to what happened is a single topaz dragon scale on the deck. |
| 2 | A topaz dragon has claimed a stretch of coastline and ordered the residents of a seaside town to vacate the area or suffer the dragon's wrath. |
| 3 | A fishery that specializes in a type of eel favored by a local topaz dragon is "haunted," and shipments of the eel vanish every time the ghost appears. |
| 4 | Legends claim that a gauntlet imbued with divine power rests in a temple beneath the waves. Unfortunately, that temple is now the lair of an especially tricky topaz dragon. |
| 5 | A topaz dragon is injured and stranded far from the sea, but the dragon is too proud to ask for help getting home. |
| 6 | A topaz dragon is building a tableau of desiccated creatures and has grown obsessed with catching one treasure hunter who escaped the dragon's clutches. |
| 7 | A topaz dragon has developed a taste for merfolk, and the merfolk community near the dragon's lair is desperate for help. |
| 8 | A topaz dragon is intent on destroying the homes of all intelligent creatures in the dragon's territory, and desperate locals seek to find out what's behind the dragon's wrath. |

**Connected Creatures.** Topaz dragons rarely tolerate any company but their own, and they are usually indifferent at best even toward their own kind. Moreover, their unpredictability means that even if a creature proves itself useful to a topaz dragon, it shouldn't count on being safe from the dragon the next time they meet. Topaz dragons rarely go out of their way to fight other creatures, however, with the exception of bronze dragons, for whom they bear an inexplicably intense hatred.

**Topaz Dragon Wyrmling Connections.** | dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Moved by pity, a giant eagle continues bringing food to an abandoned topaz dragon wyrmling, despite the wyrmling's attempts to eat the eagle. |
| 2 | A pseudodragon who is fanatical about the kinship of all dragonkind is trying to win a topaz dragon wyrmling's friendship. |
| 3 | A topaz dragon wyrmling has developed a taste for crab meat and persistently hunts a giant crab that always manages to evade the wyrmling. (The crab might have been the recipient of a druid's [awaken](/compendium/spells/awaken.md) spell.) |
| 4 | A mated pair of griffons found a topaz dragon egg, and they care for it as if it were their own. |
| 5 | A sea hag is on the hunt for a topaz dragon wyrmling, to be used as a component in a fell ritual. |
| 6 | A pirate crew keeps a curmudgeonly topaz dragon wyrmling as a beloved mascot. |
