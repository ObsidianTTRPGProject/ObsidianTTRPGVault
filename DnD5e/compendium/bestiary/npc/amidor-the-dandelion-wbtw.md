## Description

**Roleplaying Notes.** This 3-foot-tall talking dandelion finds poetry in everything and is quick to fall head over heels in love. A humble idealist, Amidor never puts its own needs above the needs of others.

**Alignment.** Neutral good.

**Personality Trait.** "My speech drifts into flowery verse, if you'll pardon the pun. Allow

me to demonstrate: Do not cry, my love! Let me catch your tears as faeries collect morning dew. Let me lift your spirits like a seed on the breeze!"

**Ideal.** "The pursuit of true love compels me! Never shall I wilt if I have such a cause to champion."

**Bond.** "The beautiful Pollenella—a vision in stripes."

**Flaw.** "I cannot resist a pretty face or a heavenly scent."
