## Description

The most numerous draconians are the foot soldiers, who are born from brass, white, or crystal dragon eggs. They are the smallest of their kind, and their slight wings are incapable of flight—though they do afford the draconians some control when falling. These wings are small enough to be hidden beneath a cloak or robe, so foot soldiers sometimes disguise themselves to get close to enemies before springing an ambush. When draconian foot soldiers die, they unleash clouds of petrifying gas, turning their corpses—and any creatures within the clouds—to stone.

On the world of Krynn, draconian foot soldiers formed from brass dragon eggs are called baaz draconians.

**Draconians.** Draconians are bipedal monsters born from dragon eggs that have been corrupted or warped by powerful magic. Most often, this corruption is a deliberate act, the work of an aspiring tyrant seeking to transform stolen eggs into a draconian army. A single corrupted egg yields several draconians of the same kind. A draconian might be taken for a dragonborn at first glance, though most kinds of draconians have wings.

When draconians die, they do not go quietly. Instead, their lifeless bodies unleash a last act of magical violence.
