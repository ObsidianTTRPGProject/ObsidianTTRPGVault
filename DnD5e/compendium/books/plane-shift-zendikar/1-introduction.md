# Introduction
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar, p. 3* 

Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering are two different games, but that doesn't mean their multiverses can't meet

> [!quote]- A quote from James Wyatt

> From the beginning, Magic's plane of Zendikar was conceived as an "adventure world" where parties of explorers delve into ancient ruins in search of wonders and treasures, fighting the monsters they encounter on the way. Many of the plane's creative roots lie in D&D, so it should be no surprise that The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar feels a lot like a D&D campaign setting book. It's littered with adventure hooks and story seeds, and lacks only the specific rules references you'd need to adapt Zendikar's races, monsters, and adventures to a tabletop D&D campaign. And it's all surrounded by amazing fantasy art that holds boundless inspiration in itself.

> You can think of Plane Shift: Zendikar as a sort of supplement to The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar, designed to help you take the world detail and story seeds contained in that book and turn them into an exciting D&D campaign. The easiest way to approach a D&D campaign set on Zendikar is to use the rules that D&D provides mostly as written: A druid on Zendikar might call on green mana and cast spells like giant growth, but she's still just a druid in the D&D rules (perhaps casting giant insect).

> D&D is a flexible rules system designed to model any kind of fantasy world. The D&D magic system doesn't involve five colors of mana or a ramping-up to your most powerful spells, but the goal isn't to mirror the experience of playing Magic in your roleplaying game. The point is to experience the worlds of Magic in a new way, through the lens of the D&D rules. All you really need is races for the characters, monsters for them to face, and some ideas to build a campaign.

> Finally, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar will help you create a D&D campaign in Zendikar, but you don't actually need the book to make use of this material—you can also refer to the abundance of lore about Zendikar found on {@link magicthegathering.com}.

## The World

Zendikar is a dangerous world of lethal risks and priceless rewards. From the perspective of its inhabitants, it is a hostile place that seems to be actively trying to kill any creature that has the audacity to live there. The danger is unrelenting. Precarious terrain, cunning predators, and natural disasters on a massive scale all present a constant challenge to survival—as do the unpredictable ripples of change that wash through the plane, known to its people as the Roil. Even the mana that suffuses the land is wild and hard to tame. It feels almost alive to those who wield it, and sometimes causes the land to manifest magical effects much like spells. Zendikar is a plane of deadly peril, but the denizens of that plane grow up strong and resilient, prepared for the dangers of the only world they know.

Planeswalkers—powerful mages with the ability to travel from world to world in the vast multiverse—have a larger perspective. To them, the dangers of Zendikar take on a different meaning. Ages ago, three alien beings of tremendous power were imprisoned on Zendikar in an effort to prevent them from consuming the entire multiverse, plane by plane. But the presence of these Eldrazi within the plane is like a festering infection within a living body. Zendikar isn't trying to exterminate all the creatures that inhabit the plane—it's been trying in vain to destroy the Eldrazi. Its inhabitants just happen to get in the way.

After centuries of being trapped in their magical prison, the Eldrazi are once again free. The other dangers of Zendikar pale in comparison to the rampaging of the three titans and the numberless broods they spawn. Civilization on Zendikar, always fragile and tentative, now teeters on the brink of destruction, and the plane itself seems threatened with extinction.

### Adventures on Zendikar

Zendikar is a world rife with adventure opportunities. Bold heroes, covetous treasure hunters, and sages seeking long-forgotten lore can all find numerous ruins to explore, mysteries to uncover, and villains and monsters to slay. Expeditionary houses, academic institutions, wealthy merchants, and retired adventurers all sponsor missions of exploration and discovery. Caravans need guards to protect them from bandits, predators, and the Roil. At the same time, the schemes of villains—from the underhanded vampire sage Anowon to the monstrous demon Planeswalker Ob Nixilis—draw would-be heroes in like moths to the flame.

### Ruins of Zendikar

Zendikar is littered with ancient sites ripe for exploration. Before the rise of the Eldrazi, expeditions to such sites were largely motivated by curiosity, the hunt for wealth or fame, or quests for magical power. Since the Eldrazi broke free of their prison, though, brave explorers have delved into these ruins in hopes of learning more about the threat they face—and how to stop it.

Player characters in a Zendikar campaign might find ruins dating from any era of that plane's history: before the arrival of the Eldrazi, the period when the Eldrazi first arrived (while the Planeswalkers worked to trap them), or the relatively peaceful time afterward.

#### Pre-Eldrazi Ruins

Before the Eldrazi ever came to Zendikar, it was not an especially remarkable world. It had powerful mana and boasted mighty civilizations of humans (on all seven continents), kor (primarily in Ondu and Akoum), elves (primarily in Murasa and Bala Ged), and merfolk (primarily in Tazeem, Guul Draz, and Sejiri). Ruins from this era naturally suggest no knowledge of the Eldrazi or the three gods inspired by the Eldrazi titans. These civilizations had their own gods, unrecognizable to contemporary eyes. In modern times, before the rise of the Eldrazi, these civilizations were often mistakenly identified as "Eldrazi," giving rise to a number of misconceptions about the nature of those alien creatures.

The time before the Eldrazi was an age of powerful magic. Ruins from this era are often warded by magical traps, but they offer commensurate rewards in the form of magic items and other magical effects (such as healing fountains). They are often haunted by spirits, shades, and wraiths, and lingering magical effects make them attractive homes for demons. Magical constructs and golems can also be found in such ruins (though not constructs made from hedrons), often standing guard over treasure vaults. Of course, some ruins have been exposed to the elements and claimed as lairs by natural animals or goblins. Monetary treasure in the ruins of Zendikar is often in the form of gems or precious art objects, but they also hold ancient coins of strange provenance, including electrum and platinum.

It is possible that living descendants of these ancient civilizations still inhabit particularly remote ruins. Such inhabitants might be monstrously degenerated from their original forms—kuo-toa with only the vaguest resemblance to their merfolk ancestors, or tieflings or yuan-ti descended from human cultures that polluted their bloodlines with dark magic.

Sites from this era include the following:

- Ior Ruin (Akoum)
- Singing City (Murasa)
- The Cipher in Flames (Murasa)
- Faduun (Jwar Isle in Ondu)
- The Sunspring (Tazeem)
- Benthidrix (Sejiri)

#### Ruins of the Eldrazi Era

When Ugin, Sorin, and Nahiri trapped the Eldrazi on Zendikar, the resulting chaos and devastation ultimately led to the downfall of the plane's ancient civilizations. Before that fall, though, powerful nations mustered mighty armies and great magic to fight the Eldrazi spawn that swarmed over the world. They harnessed existing magic as well as the power of Nahiri's hedrons to aid their efforts, and magical technology from this era is now highly sought after with the threat of the Eldrazi renewed. Magical weapons, often incorporating patterns that resemble the engravings on the hedrons, are often found in the ruins of this age. Likewise, scrolls and tomes containing knowledge of the Eldrazi and spells useful for binding or destroying them can still be found in ancient libraries of the Eldrazi era.

Temples from this era depict some of the old gods, but the worship of angels also began in this period. Some churches were raised around godlike images of Ugin (and, to a lesser extent, Sorin and Nahiri).

This era boasted the creation of sites such as these:

- Eye of Ugin (Akoum)
- Tal Terig (Akoum)
- Crypt of Agadeem (Ondu)
- Emeria, the Sky Ruin (Tazeem)

#### Post-Eldrazi Ruins

Once the Eldrazi vanished from Zendikar and Nahiri entered her stasis in the Eye of Ugin, the face of the plane changed forever. The Roil destroyed many settlements, and the kor began their nomadic lifestyle. Over time, the true nature of the Eldrazi horror was forgotten, and artistic representations of the titans as the gods of the merfolk and kor appeared in temples. Among the kor, these images were sometimes accompanied by statues of Nahiri, the "prophet of Talib" who taught her people the stoneforge arts.

Post-Eldrazi sites include the following:

- The Living Spire (Murasa)
- Ula Temple (Tazeem)
- Hagra Cistern (Guul Draz)
- Helix of Zof (Guul Draz)
