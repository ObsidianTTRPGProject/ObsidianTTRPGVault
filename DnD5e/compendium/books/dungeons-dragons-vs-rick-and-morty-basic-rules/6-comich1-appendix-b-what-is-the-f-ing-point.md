# {@comicH1 APPENDIX B: WHAT IS THE F***ING POINT?!}
*Source: Dungeons & Dragons vs. Rick and Morty: Basic Rules, p. 63* 

{@comic {@comicH3 Okay, Morty.} Maybe it's just the vodka and the tranquilizers talking, b-b-but I think we've reached a critical moment in your D&D education. Y-y-you've internalized a lot of the key features, and you're tingling with anticipation of the adventures to come.}

{@comic That's good, that's real good. Now your grandpa Rick's gonna blow your tiny mind and teach you the **deepest** and **darkest** part of D&D...}

{@comic **_{@comicH4 NONE OF THIS MATTERS**._}}

{@comic What?!}

{@comic YEAH.}

{@comicH1 the rules don't MEAN S***.}

{@comic I know what you're thinking. You're thinking,}

{@comic _"Why the hell did I just go through over sixty pages of dice and rolling and systems and spells and whatever else if none of it matters?! Why do millions of people play this weird nerdy game and invest themselves in it if none of it matters?!"_}

{@comic Y-y-your brain is focused on the game as it is, instead of the game as it **could** be, Morty. I-I-I told you at the start that D&D is a _portal gun_, and I meant that, even while I was taking potshots at Wizards of the Coast and their corporate overlord bean counters.}

{@comic People don't live heroic lives, Morty. They trudge through their feeble existence wishing they had some kind of b-b-b-*BURP*-bigger role in the universe.}

{@comic {@comicH3 That's what D&D really is, Morty.}}

{@comic It's a weird little place where everyone gets to gut goblins and blast bugbears and be kinda sorta awesome for a little while. Sometimes it's weird and annoying but when it works, Morty, when it really **works**, and your players are putty in the palm of your hand—their hopes and dreams hanging on your every word and a roll of the dice....}

{@comic That's why we do this, get it?}

{@comic You know I-I-I'm not a fan of _bureaucracy_ o-o-or _systems_. I don't do **absolutes**. Neither should you.}

{@comic I can teach you D&D Rickth Edition and make it **obvious** what you _should_ be doing, but in the end you're gonna do it your own way. You're gonna screw it all up and make a mess, and then start over and then screw it up in new and different ways.}

{@comic Good.}

{@comic {@comicH3 Roll the dice. Get stupid.}}

{@comicH1 entertain yourself. entertain your friends too.}

**_{@comicH4 THE REST DOESN'T MATTER**._}

{@comic The rest is just corporate branding and nostalgia, sucking face with nihilistic attention-seeking edgelords in search of the mighty dollar.}

{@comic Yeah, I said it.}

{@comic {@comicH3 Truth bomb barr}*uuuuurrrrp*{@comicH3 age!}}

{@comic Ready to see how a **master** crafts a memorable dungeoneering experience, Morty? Keep a hold of your butt cheeks and take a peek at the **adventure book**:}
