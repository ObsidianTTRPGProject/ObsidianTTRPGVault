On Theros, magic items carry reputations as rich and storied as those who wield them. They might take form in the god-realm of Nyx, spring from Purphoros's forge in Mount Velus, or come from legendary mortal smiths. Some crafters create great works to put an end to a specific peril, while others create to honor the gods. The most renowned works are the weapons of the gods themselves, treasures synonymous with divine power that forge legends with their every use.

## Magic Items

The following sections explore some of the magic items that heroes might encounter during their adventures across Theros. These treasures might serve as rewards for heroic deeds, or they could spur the gods' champions toward great acts. All the gods have access to mighty troves of storied items, which they have few qualms about granting to their favored servants—or reclaiming when their usefulness is over.

### Gifts of the Gods

Just as the heroes of Theros carry great destinies, so too do many of the magic items they encounter. The common folk don't typically possess magic items, yet adventurers come across them with some regularity—further evidencing the divine favor most enjoy. Nearly every magic item was created with a purpose and often carries with it a role in some greater story, whether an epic long ended or one yet untold.

As DM, feel free to make ordinary magic items feel like they have significant history and purpose. Even a +1 spear might have been carried by a company of hoplite veterans that went missing during their quest to reach the edge of the world. Wands might be crafted from legendary sources, while potions might bear the seals of famed alchemists or include signature reagents—like a pegasus feather in a [potion of flying](/compendium/items/potion-of-flying.md). The Remarkable Origins table offers just a few ways to suggest a magic item's remarkable pedigree without altering its magical properties.

Certain treasures might also be the objects of heroic quests. For example, one might not be considered a true hero until one follows in the footsteps of past legends and either makes or claims one's own magical garment from the wool of a [Nyx-fleece ram](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/nyx-fleece-ram-mot.md) (see "chapter 6"). You can also use the tables in "chapter 7" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" to help further inspire the story you create for a magic item.

**Remarkable Origins**

| dice: d12 | Origin |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | The item bears the name or emblem of a lost troop of Akroan stratians (described in "chapter 3"). |
| 2 | The item is etched with a name or prayer written in Celestial (the language of the gods). |
| 3 | The item looks like it's been at the bottom of the sea for a hundred years but functions perfectly. |
| 4 | The item is wrapped in handwritten scrolls, suggesting it was once possessed by a founder of one of Meletis's philosophical schools (described in "chapter 3"). |
| 5 | The item bears a design or sculpted feature suggestive of a Returned mask. |
| 6 | A knotted cover or grip depicts colorful birds or stylized herd animals from the plains of Oreskos. |
| 7 | The item is at least partially made from the heartwood of a Setessan caryatid (described in "chapter 3"). The wood regularly sprouts fresh leaves, or its whorls suggest humanoid features. |
| 8 | The item rests among the remains of its former owner, who thanks (or curses) those who take it. |
| 9 | The item is at least partially made of iron. |
| 10 | Whoever first touches the item receives an omen from the god who watches over it (see "chapter 4" for details on omens). |
| 11 | The item lies in a crater, as if it fell from the heavens. |
| 12 | The item glimmers with the stars of Nyx and is a perfect facsimile of an item used by a legendary hero. |

## Artifacts

Miraculous relics fill the tales of Theros. Among these legendary items, none are more renowned than the weapons of the gods themselves. These artifacts embody divine will and the power of Nyx. Where they appear, these weapons change the tide of wars and the course of history.

Typically a deity bestows their weapon only on a favored champion or devotee. Depending on the champion's piety score, the mortal can tap into hidden properties of the weapon (see "chapter 2" for details on piety). Alternatively, those who don't worship the weapon's divine owner often find themselves cursed for their lack of proper devotion.

Occasionally a god's weapon might fall into the wrong hands or go missing entirely, sparking fantastic quests. Consult the Weapons of the Gods Adventures table for suggestions of the sort of quests these artifacts might inspire.

**Weapons of the Gods Adventures**

| dice: d6 | Plot |

| 6 | A god's weapon has gained sentience (see ""Sentient Magic Items"" in chapter 7 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). Determine whether to use it, return it to its creator, or help it grow into its own being. |
