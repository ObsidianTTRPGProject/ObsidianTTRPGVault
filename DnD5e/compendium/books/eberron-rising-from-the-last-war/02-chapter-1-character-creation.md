# Chapter 1: Character Creation
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War, p. 17* 

The skyscrapers of Sharn rise up before you, the spires glimmering with magical lights. Or wind rushes through your hair as the airship you're riding races toward adventure in the jungles of Q'barra. Or you hunt Emerald Claw agents on the lightning rail, creeping through one train car after another. Or you chart another adventurous course on the war-torn continent of Khorvaire. Whatever path your character takes in Eberron, consider how the world affects your character.

Building on the book's introduction, this chapter reveals how you can create a character shaped by Eberron and its war-filled history. The chapter offers you the following choices:

**Race**. Choose one of the playable races detailed in this chapter, or pick a race from the "Player's Handbook" and learn here how Eberron has affected that species' development.

**Dragonmark**. Decide whether your character bears one of the mystical marks associated with the dragonmarked houses.

**Background**. Choose the house agent background if your character has devoted themself to serving a dragonmarked house.

**Artificer**. You have the option of choosing the artificer as your character's class, becoming an unmatched magical inventor.

**Group Patron**. Working with the other players in your group, decide which of the great powers in the world backs your group. This decision can shape your entire campaign.

## Races

Humanoids of all kinds have made their mark on the continent of Khorvaire. Presented in alphabetical order, the playable races in this section have especially shaped the land's recent history.

Each of the races described in the "Player's Handbook" has a place in Eberron. As you make a character from one of these races, this section can help you understand your character's place in the world.

This section also presents other playable races that have performed important roles in the world's evolution:

**Changelings** are clever shapechangers who can disguise themselves as other people.

**Goblinoids**—bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins—ruled Khorvaire long ago, before the madness of the daelkyr undermined them. After serving as mercenaries in the Last War, they now seek a place in the world's new order.

**Kalashtar** are humanoids bound to spirits from the plane of dreams, imbued with wisdom and telepathic talent.

**Orcs**, along with their half-orc kin, are a fierce people who have fought world-threatening evils for centuries.

**Shifters** draw on their distant lycanthropic heritage to manifest bestial traits for short periods of time.

**Warforged** are artificial lifeforms built to fight in the Last War. Created as tools of battle, they now seek a place and purpose beyond war.

## Dragonborn

> [!quote]- A quote from The Draconic Prophecy, as recorded in the _Mar'saval Scrolls_  
> 
> When the jungle's hidden darkness stirs, the children of the dragon will scatter into shadow, keeping their eternal watch. 

Tens of thousands of years ago, the dragons of Argonnessen established a garrison of dragonborn in what is now Q'barra. These warriors were assigned to protect the region against the influence of the Lords of Dust. Over time they drifted away from their duties, building a nation in eastern Khorvaire and clashing with the goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire.

This dragonborn nation came crashing down when one of the ancient fiendish Overlords stirred, unleashing fiends and corrupting many of the dragonborn themselves. Their nation in ruins, the dragonborn retreated to the darkness of Q'barra. They have remained there ever since, guarding against corruption and fighting the evil forces of the Poison Dusk—which is sometimes described as a cult devoted to a dragon, and sometimes as an army gathering in the name of a fiendish Overlord.

To date the dragonborn have largely ignored the humans of Q'barra, and the few humans who've encountered dragonborn believe they're some exotic type of lizardfolk. If you're a dragonborn, what has caused you to emerge from Q'barra? Are you on a quest to help your people or to oppose the Lords of Dust? Are you driven by wanderlust or curiosity? Did you serve as a mercenary in the Last War? How might your travels tie to the fate of your people?

## Dwarves

> [!quote]- A quote from Mror Proverb  
> 
> Gold is the gift of the mountains, but iron comes from blood and bone.

The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from "a land of endless ice." Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.

Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm below—which was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.

### Dwarves of the Mror Holds

The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions—strange symbiotic items (some of which appear in "chapter 5") that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.

Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element of your character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.

Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.

**Leaving the Mror Holds**

| dice: d8 | Reason for Leaving |
|----------|--------------------|
| 1 | A feud with a rival clan has gotten out of hand, and it's best that you spend a few decades away from the Holds while things cool down. |
| 2 | You come from a large family and there's no room for you to shine in your hold, so you hope to make a name for yourself in the wider world. |
| 3 | Your clan has arranged your marriage and your future, and you've decided to have a few adventures before you settle down. |
| 4 | You're pursuing a vendetta with a personal rival, seeking to defeat them either in battle or in business. |
| 5 | You're searching for a legendary dwarven artifact, stolen centuries ago by a Karrnish noble. |
| 6 | You want to assemble champions who can help you explore the ancient ruins beneath your ancestral home. |
| 7 | You've rejected your clan's attitude toward daelkyr magic, earning the enmity of powerful dwarves. |
| 8 | You want to understand how the other peoples of Khorvaire—especially the goblins and orcs—have fought the daelkyr. |

### Dwarves of the Five Nations

Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes—and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.

When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?

### Dwarves and Dragonmarks

The Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.

In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.

## Elves

> [!quote]- A quote from Shaeras Vadallia, High King of Valenar  
> 
> Put up your swords and talk of peace, or hide behind your walls of stone. When the host of Valenar thunders forth, neither will save you.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow—assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.

Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The drow, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.

As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship with the past: Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?

### High Elves: The Aereni

For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.

The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war, so why would any sensible elf venture into that madness? As you make an Aereni elf character, decide what has caused you to leave your island home and the protection of the Undying Court in order to wander the world. Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court? Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors? Or are you an exile, banished from your homeland for some crime against your people's rulers?

Consider your character's personal and family history. What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills? Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what's your relationship with them? Do you find it challenging to deal with the short-lived races, or are you patient with them?

### Wood Elves: The Tairnadal

Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars—against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.

The Tairnadal have three distinct lines: the Draleus Tairn, the Silaes Tairn, and the Valaes Tairn. All three lines roam the northern plains of Aerenal, having left the forest long ago, but the Valaes Tairn now reside mostly in Valenar, being the Tairnadal most often encountered in Khorvaire. Despite sharing a homeland with the Aereni, the Tairnadal have distinct religious traditions, revering their patron ancestors rather than the Undying Court.

In creating a Tairnadal character, including a Valenar elf, think about your patron ancestor. Most Tairnadal pursue the same class as their patron, so if your character is a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. Was your ancestor a famous blademaster, a stealthy hunter, or a war chanter? Were they chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their path, it is your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Do you know another elf with the same patron ancestor, and what's your relationship to that character? Do you know an elf whose patron ancestor was a bitter rival of yours?

Also consider why you are traveling with a group of player characters (who are presumably not also members of your war band) instead of serving with the Tairnadal. Do you experience visions of your patron ancestor driving you on a particular course? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors your ancestor's legendary deeds? Are you seeking vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?

### Elves of the Five Nations

Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there. Many of the finest wizards and most renowned artisans in the Five Nations are high elves. Wood elves are found among the rangers and druids of the Eldeen Reaches and stalking the darkest alleys of Sharn.

As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions of your ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.

Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?

### Drow of Xen'drik

Long ago on the continent of Xen'drik, the first drow fought beside the giants against the other elves. Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.

When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.

Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.

When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?

How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member of your adventuring party.

### Elves and Dragonmarks

The Mark of Shadow first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.

Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the Mark of Shadow appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Blades—an espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings (see "chapter 2").

## Gnomes

> [!quote]- A quote from Zil proverb  
> 
> Five words can defeat a thousand swords.

The average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words—whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.

### Gnomes of Zilargo

To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some of which persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals—of which there are many—often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.

Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.

When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.

**Zil Schemes**

| dice: d10 | Scheme |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Your family is working on a new form of elemental binding, but they need a lot of Khyber dragonshards. |
| 2 | You have an anonymous contact who sends you missions via the [sending](/compendium/spells/sending.md) spell. When you do as you're asked, you receive handsome rewards. |
| 3 | You've inherited a plot of land in Q'barra. If you don't visit within a year, you'll lose the claim. |
| 4 | Due to an unusual twist of Triumvirate law, you share the same name with a number of other Zil, and you're all legally considered to be the same person. |
| 5 | You've acquired a [spellshard](/compendium/items/spellshard-erlw.md) (described in "chapter 5") that contains a vast amount of text in a strange code. |
| 6 | You know the location of a wanted war criminal, and you've been trying to decide whether to turn them in or try to get something in exchange for your silence. |
| 7 | You've been selling false treasure maps, but now you've found one that might be real. |
| 8 | You've acquired a controlling stake in a dragonshard mine, which was abandoned long ago. But why? Kobolds? Aberrations? There's only one way to find out! |
| 9 | Your family is facing financial ruin, and they've taken out a life insurance policy on you. It only pays out if you die under unusual circumstances, and they're encouraging you to seek out more dangerous adventures. |
| 10 | You're peddling a life-extension scheme where clients are [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) by a medusa and then restored later. |
^zil-schemes

Additionally, consider your relationship to Zilargo: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories of your adventures back to the _Korranberg Chronicle_. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in Zilargo. If you are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent—gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.

#### Zil Names

Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims "the sweetest song is the name of a friend." Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.

### Gnomes of the Five Nations

As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from Zilargo into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.

As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.

### Gnomes and Dragonmarks

The Mark of Scribing appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.

Today, House Sivis provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within House Sivis's broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication.

## Goblinoids

> [!quote]- A quote from Don Bassingthwaite, _The Doom of Kings_  
> 
> Hoisting the head by the fading plumes of the ruined helmet, still tied under the chin by a cord, Haruuc raised it in one hand and his bloody sword in the other. "Your lord is dead!" he howled in the human language. "The battle is done! By my sword, I claim this place and name it Rhukaan Draal, the crown city of Darguun, the land of the people!"

The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.

### City Goblins

Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War.

### The Ghaal'dar

The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun (see "chapter 2"). The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.

As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.

### The Marguul

The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal'dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.

As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.

### The Heirs of Dhakaan

Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.

The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.

The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the _khesh'dar_ ("silent folk"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.

As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?

### Goblinoid Names

Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.

**Male Names**: Aruget, Chetiin, Daavn, Dabrak, Dagii, Drevduul, Duulan, Fenic, Gudruun, Haluun, Haruuc, Jhazaal, Kallaad, Krakuul, Krootad, Mazaan, Munta, Nasaar, Rakari, Reksiit, Tariic, Taruuzh, Thuun, Vanii, Vanon, Wuudaraj

**Female Names**: Aaspar, Aguus, Belaluur, Denaal, Draraar, Duusha, Ekhaas, Eluun, Graal, Gaduul, Hashak, Jheluum, Kelaal, Mulaan, Nasree, Raleen, Razu, Rekseen, Senen, Shedroor, Tajiin, Tuneer, Valii, Wuun

### Racial Traits

If you're playing a goblinoid, your racial traits are determined by whether you're a bugbear, goblin, or hobgoblin.

## Half-Elves

> [!quote]- A quote from Nandon Tam, Khoravar activist  
> 
> I'm not half anything. You humans come from Sarlona. Elves are from Aerenal. Me? I'm a true child of Khorvaire.

From the Towering Woods of the Eldeen Reaches to the slums of Sharn, half-elves are found across Khorvaire. New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term "half-elf," instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning "children of Khorvaire."

The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.

In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?

### Khoravar

The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.

Many Khoravar espouse the idea of "the bridge between," the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.

Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.

As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.

**Khoravar Origin**

| dice: d10 | Origin |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | You're the linchpin of a Khoravar community in a major city, hosting unity meals and maintaining connections with every half-elf in the city. |
| 2 | You grew up in a small town dominated by humans. You didn't know any other half-elves, and you did your best to fit in. |
| 3 | You lived in the Eldeen Reaches as part of a small Khoravar community, trying to be a bridge between the human farmers in the east and the druids and wilder folk in the west. |
| 4 | Your small Khoravar community has only survived in the slums of Sharn through the close, family-like support you show each other. |
| 5 | You're part of a community in Thrane whose devotion to the Silver Flame has led you to extend your unity meals to non-Khoravar. |
| 6 | Your Khoravar community is the crew of a Lhazaar ship. |
| 7 | You're part of a tiny Khoravar community in Karrnath that's fascinated with death and the practices of your Aereni ancestors, transforming your unity meals into grim celebrations of death. |
| 8 | You're part of a tiny community of Khoravar living in an unexpected place, such as Droaam, Darguun, or even the Demon Wastes. Your people strive to find common ground with the native population. |
| 9 | You are associated with House Lyrandar or House Medani, but you're more interested in the role the house plays in supporting Khoravar communities than in the work of its guilds. |
| 10 | You ride with the Valenar, hoping one day to prove that you are worthy of taking on a patron ancestor. |

### Half-Elves and Dragonmarks

Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the Mark of Detection is found in House Medani and the Mark of Storm in House Lyrandar. Both houses were established families among the Khoravar by the time their dragonmarks appeared, and they remain pillars of the Khoravar's diverse culture. The Khoravar ideal of building bridges supports the work of both houses.

With the Mark of Storm, House Lyrandar operates sailing ships and flying vessels, as well as bringing rain to farmlands. House Medani uses the Mark of Detection to offer services of personal protection.

## Halflings

> [!quote]- A quote from Sir Danton ir'Lain, Brelish knight  
> 
> Zombies? Minotaurs? They don't scare me a bit. But a howling halfling warrior charging in on a clawfoot raptor? Most terrifying thing I've ever seen.

The halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.

Lightfoot halflings are the more widespread halfling subrace, especially in the Talenta Plains, but stout halflings are found within nearly every halfling community.

### Talenta Halflings

The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.

As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.

Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halflings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs of your home remains strong.

Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration.

**Halfling Quirks**

| dice: d10 | Quirk |
|-----------|-------|
| 1 | You are constantly amazed by things the people of the Five Nations take for granted. |
| 2 | You pattern your behavior on a species of dinosaur. |
| 3 | You are extremely curious, and you're always searching for new experiences. |
| 4 | You love to boast, and you're always telling exaggerated stories of your amazing adventures. |
| 5 | You wear a mask that you believe holds the spirit of your former dinosaur mount. You like to talk to it. |
| 6 | You don't understand the concept of "facts." To you, everything is a story, and truth is in how you tell it. |
| 7 | You are annoyed by buildings and tools designed without consideration for small people. |
| 8 | You seek vengeance for a wrong done to your people. |
| 9 | You never forget an insult or injury. |
| 10 | You ascribe everything to the work of spirits. |
^halfling-quirks

### Halflings of the Five Nations

Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.

Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sharn, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point of contact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron, as described later in this chapter.

### Halflings and Dragonmarks

Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.

With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.

## Humans

> [!quote]- A quote from Kessler, bard of Sharn  
> 
> Dwarves are stoic. Elves are wise. Gnomes are cunning. And humans? They can't make up their mind, so they try to be all of these things at once.

The first human settlers came to Khorvaire about 3,000 years ago, landing in the area now known as the Lhazaar Principalities. From there, they began a slow but inexorable spread across the continent, disrupting the placid elven empire of Aerenal and leaving further ruined remnants of fallen Dhakaani goblin kingdoms in their wake. During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries. Despite their relatively short lifespans—or perhaps because of them—humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing their limits and pursuing new ideas.

Humans prove extremely diverse; a barbarian from the Demon Wastes has little in common with a Brelish rogue. When creating a human character, consider where you're from and how that's reflected in your class and background. "Chapter 2" presents an overview of the nations of Khorvaire and ideas for characters tied to those lands. Aundair is a logical place of origin for a wizard character, but your wizard could be a down-and-out arcanist from the alleys of Sharn or a Lhazaar pirate with a knack for the mystic arts.

If you want to jump-start your ideas for a human character's origins, you can roll on the Human Origins table.

**Human Origins**

| dice: d10 | Origin |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | An impoverished wizard from Aundair, striving to prove you're as intelligent as any other Aundairian |
| 2 | A streetwise rogue from Breland who wants nothing more than to escape the bustle of Sharn forever |
| 3 | A displaced Cyran fighter who was engaged in war outside Cyre at the time of the Mourning and is now stranded with no home |
| 4 | A barbarian from the Demon Wastes who repented from a life of cruelty and hopes to atone for past evils |
| 5 | A kindly druid from the Eldeen Reaches who wants to learn about the flora and fauna of the rest of Khorvaire and beyond |
| 6 | A cleric from Karrnath who aspires to learn the arts of necromancy—for the noblest aims, of course |
| 7 | A piratical bard from the Lhazaar Principalities who loves sea shanties but also wants to immortalize the deeds of great heroes in song |
| 8 | A ranger trained to hunt the jungles of Q'barra who harbors a grudge against dragons |
| 9 | A warlock from the Shadow Marches, teetering on the edge of sanity while contemplating the daelkyr |
| 10 | A Thrane paladin of the Silver Flame who's looking for something to prove the truth underpinning belief |

### Humans and Dragonmarks

Five different dragonmarks appear among humans, reflecting their dominant status among the races of Khorvaire:

- The Mark of Making is found in House Cannith, which has used it to become one of the most powerful houses, creating an abundance of both magical and technological wonders.
- The Mark of Passage aids the humans of House Orien in operating the lightning rail and trade caravans running across the continent.
- The Mark of Sentinel makes the bodyguards, mercenaries, and Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith widely respected across Khorvaire.
- The Mark of Handling appears in House Vadalis, which uses it to breed fine mounts and other creatures.
- Humans also number among House Tharashk and manifest the Mark of Finding with their half-orc kin.

## Orcs and Half-Orcs

> [!quote]- A quote from Kalaash'arna, Tharashk inquisitive  
> 
> We are hunters in a world of sheep.

Thousands of years before humans came to Khorvaire, the land was dominated by wild orcs and goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire. The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.

Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:

- The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the "binding flame"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call of Kalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.
- The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.
- The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.

### Orcs of the Shadow Marches

The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. Orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.

Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.

When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.

**Leaving the Shadow Marches**

| dice: d8 | Reason for Leaving |
|----------|--------------------|
| 1 | You're associated with the Gatekeepers, and you're on a quest to combat a daelkyr-related threat beyond the bounds of the Shadow Marches. |
| 2 | House Tharashk recruited you from the Marches to serve as a mercenary in the Last War. |
| 3 | You're a simple hunter, but you've decided to seek your fortune or a real challenge in the world beyond the Marches. |
| 4 | Your village was destroyed by monsters from Droaam, so you're looking for a new place in the world. |
| 5 | As a cultist of the Dragon Below, you believe that slaying powerful foes is the only way to earn your passage to the paradise that lies deep within the hollow world. You've ventured beyond the Marches in search of worthy enemies. |
| 6 | Your clan works with House Tharashk, and you've been recruited as a bounty hunter or investigator even though you're not a member of the house. |
| 7 | The leader of your clan committed a great wrong against another clan, which has now sworn to exterminate every last member of your clan. What better time to see the world? |
| 8 | Your work as an investigator has set you upon a trail of mysteries that leads far beyond the Marches. |

### Half-Orcs of Khorvaire

With the rise of the dragonmarked House Tharashk, orcs and half-orcs have spread through the Five Nations and beyond. In general, the people of the Five Nations know little about half-orcs. When people imagine a half-orc, they usually think of a Tharashk bounty hunter or dogged inquisitive, but a few ignorant sorts might still hold the stereotype of a "simpleton from the swamps."

### Half-Orcs and Dragonmarks

The Mark of Finding appears among half-orcs and humans of House Tharashk. Strangely, orcs associated with the house cannot develop this mark. Dragonmarked half-orcs work extensively with humans, orcs, and unmarked half-orcs in pursuit of the house's mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting. Across Khorvaire, anyone who wants to find something or someone turns to House Tharashk.

## Tieflings

_"The Chieftain Who Leads them," Thuel asked, "what do we know of him?"_

_"His name is Kathrik Mel. He inspires tremendous loyalty in the barbarians, an almost religious fervor."_

_"He's a demon?"_

_"I don't think so. The Ghaash'kala call him a sak'vanarrak—it translates as something like 'fiend-touched.' A Karrn scholar coined the word tiefling. I think he's some mixture of fiend and mortal, more like a savior than a god."_

> [!quote]- A quote from James Wyatt, _Dragon Forge_  
> 
> Thuel frowned. "Their savior, our damnation."

Tieflings rarely appear in the cities and towns of Khorvaire, with most dwelling at the fringes of civilization.

Many tieflings are born to the Carrion Tribes, the barbarians who live in the Demon Wastes. Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose—perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord—and you are fleeing that destiny.

Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.

Finally, the Venomous Demesne—a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam—is populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from Sarlonan mages who bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne's lords being powerful warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the Five Nations and few know it exists. Your character could be an envoy or exile from it, or simply an adventurer driven by a desire to see what lies beyond your homeland.
