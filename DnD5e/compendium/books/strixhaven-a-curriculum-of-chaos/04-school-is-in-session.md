# School Is in Session
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos, p. 41* 

The following four chapters present a series of Dungeons & Dragons adventures optimized for four to six characters. Each adventure takes place on and around the Strixhaven campus. In these adventures, the player characters are students attending the university, and they become heroes in their own right as they navigate plots, overcome monsters, and thwart dangers that arise in each adventure.

"Chapters 1" and "2" contain all the information the players need to play Strixhaven students. Each adventure takes place over the course of one academic year. For instance, "Campus Kerfuffle," the adventure in this chapter, takes place during the characters' first year at the university. "Hunt for Mage Tower," in chapter 4, takes place during the characters' second year at the university, and so on. The adventures can be run consecutively as a campaign or individually, as described below.

## Running the Adventures

To run these adventures, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks: the "Player's Handbook", the "Dungeon Master's Guide", and the "Monster Manual".

> Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
^0d3

When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block. In other words, when you see a name in bold type, you should get the creature's stat block ready because you're going to need it soon. If the stat block appears in "chapter 7", the text tells you. Otherwise, you can find the stat block in the "Monster Manual".

Spells and equipment mentioned in these adventures are described in the "Player's Handbook". If an adventure doesn't describe a magic item, you can find the magic item's description in the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

### A Strixhaven Campaign

If you run these adventures as a campaign, one villain is behind the chaos on campus: the bullywug [Murgaxor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/murgaxor-scc.md) Grenshel, a disgruntled former student who attended Strixhaven centuries ago. [Murgaxor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/murgaxor-scc.md)—who uses evil magic to sustain his life force—focuses his all-consuming desire for revenge on destroying Strixhaven University.

The adventures assume you're playing a Strixhaven campaign, and each adventure provides information about how [Murgaxor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/murgaxor-scc.md)'s influence corrupts and warps creatures and places on campus. The end of each adventure provides information that foreshadows or sets up the events of the next adventure. The characters ultimately confront [Murgaxor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/murgaxor-scc.md) in chapter 6, where the villain is described in detail.

### Character Creation

Before starting any of this book's adventures, consult "chapter 2" for guidance on making Strixhaven characters and uniting those characters in a group.

### Character Advancement

In these adventures, the characters receive experience points for achieving story milestones, rather than for defeating monsters. Each adventure tells you when the characters advance to the next level.

### Standalone Adventures

Rather than playing the four adventures as a campaign, you can run them as standalone adventures. A section near the start of each adventure tells you how to use the adventure in this way.

If you run any of these adventures separately, you should ask the players to create characters of the appropriate starting level for the adventure, as shown in the Adventure Levels table.

**Adventure Levels**

| Adventure | Starting Level | Chapter |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Campus Kerfuffle | 1st | 3 |
| Hunt for Mage Tower | 4th | 4 |
| The Magister's Masquerade | 6th | 5 |
| A Reckoning in Ruins | 8th | 6 |
^adventure-levels

#### Relationships

If you run chapter 4, 5, or 6 as a standalone adventure, you should ask each player to choose at least one student to be a Friend, a Beloved, or a Rival, as described in the Relationship rules later in this chapter. The Starting Relationship Points table lists the number of points a character has at the start with the chosen Friend, Beloved, or Rival.

**Starting Relationship Points**

| Person | Relationship Points |
|--------|---------------------|
| Friend | 2 |
| Beloved | 3 |
| Rival | −2 |
^starting-relationship-points

### Using the Maps

This book contains a number of interior maps and is accompanied by a poster map, all of which will aid you as you run these adventures.

#### Interior Maps

Maps in the book primarily depict areas for the characters to explore or areas where combat is likely to occur. These maps are designed to be easily reproduced on graph paper, a wet-erase mat, or some other surface to help the players visualize locations and devise combat strategies. You can alter a map's features as you see fit.

On interior maps, an arrow on a slope or staircase points in the ascending direction. When elevation numbers appear on a map, a plus sign indicates a rise of the indicated number of feet, while a minus sign indicates a depression.

#### Poster Map

The poster map is meant to be shared with the players. One side shows the Strixhaven University campus, with a focus on the central campus and the five surrounding colleges. The other side of the poster shows detailed maps of key campus locations, some of which the characters visit in multiple adventures.

### The Passage of Time

Each adventure in this book takes place over the course of an academic year, which is no longer than a calendar year. The adventures include events, but those events aren't the entire extent of the characters' experience on campus that year. Unless explicitly stated, assume that anywhere from a few days to a few weeks passes between the events of an adventure. You can decide how quickly the year passes and work with your players to decide what else they get up to. You can conduct roleplaying scenes with the characters' fellow students, taking into account their Friends, Rivals, and Beloveds. You might also narratively describe developments in their courses to help the academic year feel varied and robust.

Finally, as the characters are completing tasks together for their courses or hanging out with their fellow students, consider challenging them with random monster encounters that crop up on campus. These encounters might be truly random, or they could be unexpected side-effects of the more significant events unfolding in the adventure. Each chapter includes a table tailored for that adventure.

## Strixhaven Tracking Sheet

The sections on the following pages give special rules for certain aspects of university life. Players can use the sheet below to keep track of the effects of those rules on their characters. Each player should have a copy to use during the course of the adventures. The tracking sheet includes the following parts:

- **Relationships.** The player notes here the names of each student NPC with whom their character has a Relationship. The player should track how many Relationship Points their character has with each NPC; whether that NPC is a Friend, a Rival, or a Beloved; whether that NPC confers Beloved Inspiration; and that NPC's Bond Boon or Bond Bane, whichever is applicable.
- **Report Cards.** This section includes places to track the results of each Exam.
- **Extracurriculars.** The player notes the Extracurriculars in which their character is participating. The player should also note each Extracurricular's NPC member. Remind players that while their character participates in an Extracurricular, they gain a positive or negative Relationship Point with its associated student NPC.
- **Job.** The player should note their character's job, if any. Remind the player that while their character holds a job, the character gains a positive or negative Relationship Point with its associated student coworker, whom they should also note on this sheet.
- **Student Dice.** The player should track the Student Dice their character has from passing Exams and from Extracurriculars. They should also note the skills their character can expend the Student Dice on. They should check the "d4" box whenever they gain a Student Die, and they should erase the check mark when they expend the die.

## Extracurriculars

Extracurriculars—the campus clubs and societies students can join—are a key part of student life at Strixhaven. Using the rules that follow, characters can join Extracurriculars to add flavor to the book's adventures, gain minor rules benefits, and perhaps more easily befriend—or irritate—their classmates.

### Joining an Extracurricular

At any point during the book's adventures, a character can gain the benefit of two of the Extracurriculars noted below, as described later in this section. If a student character also works on campus using the Job rules, the character can benefit from only one Extracurricular.

Characters can gain the benefit from a new Extracurricular only by joining it at the start of an academic year, which corresponds to the beginning of a new adventure. Typically, joining an Extracurricular in between academic years isn't eventful. Players should note the changes on their tracking sheet.

### Extracurricular Benefits

While a student participates in an Extracurricular, they gain a Student Die and a Relationship Point, as explained below.

#### Student Dice

Each character gains one Student Die for each Extracurricular they are participating in. A Student Die is a d4 the player can roll and add to an ability check that the character makes, provided the check uses one of the skills listed in the Extracurricular's description. The player can wait until after rolling the d20 before rolling the Student Die, but must do so before you say whether the check succeeds or fails. No more than one Student Die can be rolled per check. After rolling a Student Die, a player can't roll it again until the character finishes a long rest.

#### Relationship Point

While a student participates in an Extracurricular, the student gains either a positive or a negative Relationship Point (the player's choice) with one student NPC who is also a member of the Extracurricular (see the Relationship rules later in this chapter).

### Quitting an Extracurricular

Characters can quit an Extracurricular at any time, updating their tracking sheet accordingly. When a student quits an Extracurricular, they immediately lose its benefits. If a character quits during an adventure, you might want to roleplay the situation, since NPCs are likely to take an interest in why the student is leaving.

### Extracurricular Options

## Jobs

Working in gainful employment while at school can provide a character with a modicum of cash and help forge connections with student coworkers.

### Getting or Losing a Job

A character can hold one Job at a time, and they can participate in only one Extracurricular while they have a Job. A student can switch Jobs whenever they wish, even in the middle of the academic year, as long as they don't work more than one Job at a time. At your discretion, switching Jobs in the middle of the year might lead to a roleplaying scenario.

### Job Benefits

While a student has a Job, they earn a wage and a Relationship Point, as explained below.

#### Wage

A student who works a Job gains 5 gp at the start of each week that they hold the Job. If a student quits during the academic year, they stop earning this money at the end of the week in which they quit.

#### Relationship Point

While a character works a Job, they gain a positive or negative Relationship Point (the player's choice) with one student NPC at that Job. This represents a coworker with whom the character is often scheduled and with whom they can easily form a connection (see the Relationship rules later in this chapter).

### Job Options

Student characters can find work at the places below. A number of possible positions are noted for each place, along with NPC coworkers.

#### Biblioplex

- **Jobs.** Book clerk, book shelver, café worker, cleanup crew member, garden tender, store worker
- **Coworker.** Drazhomir Yarnask

## Exams

The characters' years at Strixhaven are covered by each of this book's adventures, which focus on the notable and even shocking events that take place at the university. Even though the characters' studies include the trappings of academic life—attending lectures, participating in labs, reading textbooks—those everyday academic activities mostly take place in the background. The exam rules presented here are thus designed to help the players keep their characters' studies part of the game.

### Using These Rules

Each of the book's adventures includes Exams. Though each character might be a member of a different college at Strixhaven, the adventures assume that the characters take at least one general education or interdisciplinary course together each year. It is this course that the Exam rules represent.

Each Exam encounter has a Studying phase followed by a Testing phase. In general, a character can approach Studying in any way they desire, with that phase then culminating in a single ability check of their choice. In contrast, Testing requires ability checks using specific skills.

In each phase, resolve the outcome of one character's ability checks before moving on to another character. (If any characters are studying together, however, resolve their ability checks at the same time. See below for more information.)

Don't forget to have each player mark the results of an Exam on their tracking sheet!

### Studying Phase

The Studying phase of an Exam represents the characters brushing up on their coursework, prompting sparks of insight when faced with difficult questions, or using mnemonics or other memorization techniques to absorb academic material.

During the Studying phase, each character must succeed on an ability check against a DC noted in the encounter. They can use any ability and skill they wish when making this check, but they can make it only once.

For example, one student might make an Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check to pore over their books, while another student makes a Charisma ([Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check to create a series of spoken mnemonic devices. A third student might make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check to create reminding gestures or practice any physical components that are part of a course, such as the somatic gestures involved in spellcasting.

On a successful check, the character gains one reroll to use during the character's next Testing phase.

#### Pulling an All-Nighter

After pulling an all-nighter, a character gains two rerolls to use during the next Testing phase if the character succeeds on the ability check. Doing so imposes a cost: the character gains 1 level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) that takes effect at the start of the day of the Exam. This level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) can't be removed until after the Exam.

#### Studying Together

If two or more characters engage in a group study session, each participating character has advantage on their ability check during the Studying phase.

#### Skipping Studying

A character can skip the Studying phase if they wish, forgoing the chance of gaining these rerolls.

### Testing Phase

Once the Studying phase of an Exam is over, have the players record any rerolls their characters receive, then begin the Testing phase.

#### Ability Checks

Each Exam's Testing phase consists of two ability checks, with specifics (including the DC) noted in the encounter. If a character gained any rerolls during the Studying phase, the character can use one reroll when making a Testing ability check, rerolling the check's d20 and using the new roll.

Each character's Testing phase has three possible results:

- **Failed.** No successful ability checks means a character failed, having gotten fewer than half the questions correct.
- **Passed.** One successful ability check means a character passed, having gotten half or more of the questions correct, but not all the questions. The character gains one Student Die, explained below.
- **Aced.** Two successful ability checks mean the character aced the Exam, having gotten all the questions correct. The character gains two Student Dice, explained below.

#### Cheating

An unscrupulous character can cheat on an Exam. Doing so requires a successful Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check and a successful Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check, both using the DC set for the Exam. If a character cheats, they can't use any rerolls from their Studying phase.

If the character fails either of these checks, a proctor or other authority figure notices the cheating, and the student fails the exam.

If the Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception)) and Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) checks are both successful, the character successfully cheats and aces the Exam.

#### Failed Exam

If a character fails an Exam, Strixhaven's bylaws require them to attend tutoring with a junior faculty member until they achieve at least a passed Exam in a different Exams encounter. This tutoring can be narrated through roleplaying, or you might simply inform the player of this result.

A student who must attend tutoring can't take part in any Extracurriculars or Jobs until they achieve at least a passed Exam during one of that academic year's Exam encounters. The character thus loses any benefits from Extracurriculars or Jobs, and their player should indicate this suspension on their tracking sheet.

#### Student Dice

A Student Die gained from an Exam is a d4 the player can roll and add to an ability check that the character makes, provided the check uses one of the two skills featured in the Exam. The player can wait until after rolling the d20 before rolling the Student Die, but must do so before you say whether the check succeeds or fails. No more than one Student Die can be rolled per check. After rolling a Student Die, a player can't roll it again until the character finishes a long rest.

Players should note any Student Dice they gain and the skills those dice can apply to on their tracking sheet.

At the end of each academic year, players lose any Student Dice their characters have earned from an Exam.

## Relationships

As students, the characters have the opportunity to cement friendships, establish rivalries, deepen bonds, and otherwise develop relationships with student NPCs in this book's adventures. Although these pursuits could be played out entirely with roleplaying, you can use the following Relationship rules to reinforce this aspect of the adventures.

These rules provide characters with benefits—or drawbacks!—based on their social endeavors, infusing their interactions with other students with rules weight, and making this integral part of student life a more significant part of the game.

The rules encompass only interactions with student NPCs. Professors, administrators, and other older adults aren't part of the Relationship rules.

### Session Zero

If you're interested in using these rules in your game, consider holding a session zero to introduce the rules to the players. Such a session zero allows you to ascertain players' comfort with these rules.

If some players want to use these rules and other players don't, using these rules only for some characters, or not using them at all, doesn't unbalance these adventures. Similarly, if you are uncomfortable engaging with the roleplaying encounters these rules describe, we recommend you don't use them.

If any players exhibit trepidation, err on the side of caution and don't use these rules for some or all of the characters. Characters who use these rules will have more focused roleplaying time than those who don't, so you might want to compensate for that lack of "on-screen" time with additional roleplaying encounters for the other characters.

### Using These Rules

The book's adventures include Relationship encounters, featuring events during which characters can interact with one or more of the student NPCs in the "Fellow Students" section. When such an encounter begins, use the adventure's read-aloud text to describe the scene. Then work with the characters one at a time until each has had a turn to interact with the student NPCs.

The character of each participating player gains 1 Relationship Point or more with student NPCs during Relationship encounters. A character's number of Relationship Points with a specific NPC determines their status with that NPC.

#### Introducing the NPCs

Use the entries in the "Fellow Students" section to populate Strixhaven as the characters explore it, both during and between adventures. Highlight those NPCs when the characters are at a Job or participating in an Extracurricular, and draw from the entries whenever you want to roleplay an NPC in a classroom setting.

When it comes time for a Relationship encounter, you might ask a player whether a specific NPC has intrigued them. If so, make sure that NPC interacts with them during the encounter. Alternatively, characters who have joined an Extracurricular or taken on a Job might encounter an NPC associated with that endeavor.

You may also allow your players to browse the "Fellow Students" section to learn more about the NPCs.

#### Relationship Points

The characters have opportunities throughout the adventures in this book to gain Relationship Points with student NPCs. At your discretion, in addition to Relationship encounters, other roleplaying encounters might also provide Relationship Points.

A character's total number of Relationship Points with an NPC determines their status with that NPC, as described below. Relationship Points start at 0 and increase or decrease by 1 each time a character interacts with one of the NPCs covered by these rules, whether in a Relationship encounter or during another roleplaying scene.

When a character interacts with a student NPC, that character's player decides which of the following categories they wish their response to fall under:

- **Friendly Response.** A friendly response earns 1 Relationship Point. A friendly response is positive; it might take the form of showing warmth or providing affirmation and camaraderie, as the encounter dictates.
- **Rivalrous Response.** A rivalrous response earns −1 Relationship Point. A rivalrous response is negative, and might take the form of being rude to the NPC, antagonizing the NPC, or taking similar unkind actions.

Each time a character's number of Relationship Points changes for an NPC, the player should note that on their tracking sheet. The sheet can also be used to track other details about the Relationship.

### Making Friends and Rivals

While a character has 2 Relationship Points or more with a student NPC, that NPC becomes a Friend, and the character receives a **Bond Boon** from that person as long as the NPC is a Friend.

While a character has −2 Relationship Points or less with a student NPC, that NPC becomes a Rival, and the character receives a **Bond Bane** from that person as long as the NPC is a Rival.

Bond Boons and Bond Banes are noted in each NPC entry in the "Fellow Students" section. When a character makes a Friend or a Rival, the player should note it on their tracking sheet.

At any time during the adventures in this book, a character can end their friendship with an NPC, effective immediately. When they do so, that character's Relationship Points with the NPC reset to 0.

#### Deepening Relationships

Once a student NPC has become a character's Friend, the character has the option of deepening the Relationship. The next time a Relationship encounter happens with the Friend, the character can express a wish for a deeper connection with that NPC. This might be a romantic pairing, a deeper platonic camaraderie, or a sibling-like bond. Before this encounter takes place, talk to the player to ensure a clear understanding of what sort of Relationship they seek with the NPC.

##### Becoming Beloveds

If a player wants a deeper Relationship between their character and a Friend, the Friend can become the character's Beloved if the character has 2 Relationship Points or more with the NPC. During the next Relationship encounter, they can deepen their Relationship and become Beloveds, in addition to the normal interaction the Relationship encounter allows.

##### Beloved Inspiration

When a character has a Beloved, the character gains Beloved Inspiration at the end of each long rest. Beloved Inspiration functions like regular "Inspiration" (as described in the "Player's Handbook"), except a character regains a number of uses of Beloved Inspiration after each long rest equal to the number of Beloveds they have, not to exceed a number equal to their proficiency bonus.

##### Ending Beloved Relationships

A character can end a Beloved Relationship at any time. When that Relationship ends, the NPC no longer provides Beloved Inspiration to the character.

If the character's Relationship Points with the NPC ever drop below 1, the Beloved Relationship ends immediately.

### Fellow Students

The student NPCs are described on the next few pages. Each NPC entry includes personal details and a short biography, along with the Extracurriculars and Job the character is involved in, if any. If an NPC becomes a character's Friend, the character receives the Bond Boon noted in the NPC's entry. If the NPC becomes a Rival, the character suffers the noted Bond Bane instead.

#### College and Year

The academic year noted for an NPC is during the "Campus Kerfuffle" adventure in this chapter. College affiliations for first-year students are provided for flavor and for their subsequent years (students don't join a college until their second year).

If you're playing the adventures in later chapters, the NPCs noted as first-year students have advanced to be the same year as the player characters, and have officially joined their colleges. NPCs noted as second-year students are always a year ahead of the characters. During "A Reckoning in Ruins" in chapter 6, student NPCs who were in higher years when the characters started at Strixhaven are still around on campus as continuing students or recent alumni.

#### Stat Blocks

The student NPCs are meant to interact with the characters primarily in roleplaying situations and to help create the flavor of attending a university. They aren't intended to wade into combat—or even venture off campus—when the characters embark on adventures.

In general, avoid putting these student NPCs in danger with the characters. In situations when you need stat blocks for these NPCs, use the stat block indicated for them in the Student NPC Stat Blocks table, where the stat blocks depend on the student's year during the current adventure. These stat blocks can be found in "chapter 7", and in the table, "[College]" refers to the name of the NPC's college: Lorehold, Prismari, Quandrix, Silverquill, or Witherbloom.

**Student NPC Stat Blocks**

| Year | Stat Block |
|------|------------|
| First | [First-Year Student](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/first-year-student-scc.md) |
| Second | [College] Apprentice |
| Third or Later | [College] Pledgemage |

#### Aurora Luna Wynterstarr

_Neutral Dhampir First Year (Witherbloom_)

Before arriving at Strixhaven, Aurora changed her name and appearance to that of her on-stage persona: Aurora Luna Wynterstarr, the brilliant singer and songwriter. Aurora was born a dhampir (a partial vampire), which she's taken as a cosmic sign that she is meant for greatness.

An accomplished musician on several instruments, Aurora is often found at Bow's End Tavern performing beautiful dirges on the hurdy-gurdy for the assembled patrons. Aurora is also a member of the Strixhaven Show Band Association, though she believes the music they play lacks the raw emotion of her original compositions.

She works as a groundskeeper at the Strixhaven Stadium, where she takes great pleasure in using magic to blight undesirable vegetation on the field.

#### Bhedum "Rampart" Sooviij

_Lawful Neutral Loxodon First Year (Lorehold_)

Since their name is difficult to pronounce without a trunk, Bhedum has taken to referring to themself as "Rampart," the closest translation of their name in Common. They are often found poring over ancient texts detailing battles, seeking to better understand the tactical decisions that result in victory and defeat. Rampart is happy to discuss their knowledge with fellow members of the Dragonsguard Historical Society, often doing so late into the night.

Rampart's opponents at the Dragonchess Club find themselves outmatched time and again by the loxodon's technique, though Rampart is a gracious winner. They attend all their classes clad in gilded, centuries-old plate armor, with an immense and similarly decorated sword strapped to their back. Rampart explains that doing so better simulates the battlefield conditions they study.

#### Cadoras Damellawar

_Chaotic Good Elf First Year (Quandrix_)

Cadoras is a jolly soul, and anyone who spends time with him ends up chuckling at whatever nonsense he is currently sporting. He is a passionate member of the Live-Action Roleplaying Guild and loves playing out all sorts of fantastical adventures. He always roleplays archers, entirely because he's recently spent a lot of money on a prop-bow and can't afford anything else. He is also a member of the university's Distinguished Society of Fine Artists, where he uses magic to sculpt beautiful statuary of complex fractal patterns. The fact that he is self-taught makes the quality of his work that much more impressive.

Cadoras does have some strange eating habits; he sometimes eats an entire jar of pickled onions in a single sitting and then drinks the vinegar.

#### Drazhomir Yarnask

_Neutral Good Minotaur Second Year (Quandrix_)

Drazhomir is so soft-spoken that many of his peers must ask him to speak up to be understood. He is over seven feet tall, yet he continuously stoops, as if trying to occupy as little space as possible. Several activities and clubs that involve feats of strength and size continuously try to recruit him—to no avail. Drazhomir prefers spending his time in the Biblioplex, where he works as a book clerk, assisting students in finding required texts and shelving returns. He moves silently through the stacks, and he has given more than one student a scare when they've turned around to suddenly find him there.

Drazhomir's greatest love is poetry. As a member of the university's Dead Languages Society, he scours ancient literature for stirring poems written in old tongues, reading them to the rest of the group in a soft, resonant voice that comes directly from his soul.

> - **Bond Bane.** Other students who work in the Biblioplex refuse to help you find any of the tomes you seek. Even the reference librarians are more cryptic.

#### Grayson Wildemere

_Neutral Human First Year (Silverquill_)

Grayson comes from an old, moneyed, and influential family. To him, studying at Strixhaven is a means to an end. Learning business acumen is just as important to Grayson as his classes, so he has joined the Future Entrepreneurs of Strixhaven. Grayson makes a point to know as much about everyone as possible, gathering information until he finds the best circumstance to use it. Having learned to pick locks, he often accesses places where he's unauthorized, searching for secrets.

Grayson has become a writer for the _Strixhaven Star_, where he's responsible for the gossip column. His writing style is biting, and he uses this platform to expose bullies and mock ignorance. Many of his peers are leery of him, but some have witnessed him paying for poorer students' books and other supplies—a fact he tries to keep secret.

^141

#### Greta Gorunn

_Chaotic Good Dwarf First Year (Lorehold_)

Greta is often heard long before she is seen, as her raucous laughter echoes through the university's halls. Enjoying a reputation as a golden-hearted troublemaker, Greta hates studying and grumbles about it at length. This has led to numerous warnings from the librarians for unnecessarily loud behavior, much to Greta's amusement.

A fervent member of the Strixhaven Iron-Lifters Society, she has already started to break long-held records in both powerlifting and weightlifting. When not training or competing (or occasionally studying), Greta spends her time in Bow's End Tavern carousing. As beer isn't free, she helps out at Strixhaven Stadium, setting up and putting away heavy equipment. Most people would begrudge the hard labor, but Greta happily does it, reasoning that she is being paid to work out.

Greta makes a point to write regularly to her older brother, Grog, whom she misses terribly.

^143

#### Javenesh Stoutclaw

_Neutral Good Owlin Second Year (Lorehold_)

Javenesh is an imposing and powerfully built owlin who looks permanently scruffy despite his best efforts. Contributing to his dishevelment are tufts of juvenile plumage that refuse to smooth down, a handful of scars whose origin he's not sure of, and at least one hole in whatever clothing he's wearing.

Contrary to what people initially assume, Javenesh is a friendly sort. To make ends meet, he works at Bow's End Tavern, managing servers and keeping the peace, relying on his rough appearance to dissuade those intent on making trouble. When not attending classes, Javenesh is an intimidating presence at the Intramural Silkball Club, where few people want to see him barreling toward them. He wishes more people would take the effort to get to know him, rather than be put off by his size and rough exterior.

^145

#### Larine Arneza

_Neutral Good Human First Year (Quandrix_)

Some think Larine is aloof to the point of being rude, but her friends say that nothing is further from the truth. She is a delightful presence and doesn't ignore social obligations so much as get distracted easily. Larine is a member of the Intramural Water-Dancing Club, where she performs underwater balletic movements effortlessly. Despite her swimming ability, her tendency to lose focus means learning group choreography takes her more time and effort. Larine has a natural affinity with animals, especially aquatic species, and she's working on a solo synchronized swimming routine that replaces the other students with a shoal of fish. Rehearsals aren't going well. As an employee of the Strixhaven Performing Arts Society, Larine is a ticket taker, a job she's recently switched to as a result of struggling to give correct change while working at the box office.

> - **Bond Bane.** You are offered the worst tickets to performances, if any at all.
^147

#### Melwythorne

_Neutral Good Dryad First Year (Witherbloom_)

Towering over most students, Melwythorne strikes an imposing figure, especially given the branches that grow from his head like antlers. Calm in demeanor, he's often confused by the people rushing around him, as their haste won't lengthen their brief lifespans. Melwythorne had never been away from his grove before coming to Strixhaven and has found the transition to university life difficult. However, since he joined the Intramural Silkball Club, this close-knit surrogate family has helped him deal with his homesickness.

He is also a member of the Student-Mages of Faith. He enjoys helping his fellow students celebrate their high holidays and discussing theology and spirituality. For him, the natural world and all living beings form a vast consciousness across all planes of existence, transcending the power and reach of any one deity.

> - **Bond Boon.** Melwythorne's spirituality centers you. You can calm even the most frazzled of your peers and, if necessary, extract information as needed.
> - **Bond Bane.** Members of the silkball club and the Student-Mages of Faith refuse to acknowledge your presence.

#### Mina Lee

_Lawful Good Human Second Year (Silverquill_)

Mina's greatest love is the use of language; she adores how subtle differences in intonation and vocabulary can shape one's perception of reality. Her fascination with language extends to spells and verbal components. After graduation, she plans to conduct research on the variance of language in spells and how one might tweak verbal components that the greater magical community considers immutable.

Mina's love of language and nuance has led her to join the _Strixhaven Star_ as an investigative journalist. Here, she reveals truth, corrects misconceptions, and combats injustice. She has also taken a job as a server at Firejolt Café, which not only provides some cash but also puts her in a position to overhear snippets of conversation that might provide leads for her journalistic investigations.

> - **Bond Bane.** Firejolt Café never has the ingredients in stock for the beverages you initially order, even if it's a common drink.
^14c

#### Nora Ann Wu

_Neutral Good Human Second Year (Prismari_)

Rarely without a smile on her face, Nora is a kind person who is generous with her time and attention. This has led her to gain employment within the university's dormitories, where she acts as a resident assistant. Nora offers confidential support to any student and is especially passionate about counseling other transgender students. She thoughtfully handles concerns ranging from students' homesickness to matters that require her to act as an advocate for another student.

Nora is a passionate member of the Distinguished Society of Fine Artists. As such, she spends hours on the potter's wheel throwing clay. Despite her enthusiasm, her technical skill is lacking. Her tutors, in attempts to be encouraging, often describe Nora's work as rustic or naive. Undeterred, Nora continues to produce terrible mug after terrible mug, which she gives as gifts to her friends.

> [!quote] ...

^14e

#### Quentillius Antiphiun Melentor III

_Neutral Human First Year (Prismari_)

Quentillius approaches all his endeavors with the utmost seriousness. He believes one should either do something correctly or not at all. Quentillius is a member of the university's Playactors Drama Guild, where his dedication to what he calls "the craft" is absolute. He looks down on other actors who are slow to memorize lines or who miss cues. Backstage crew members fare better, as Quentillius regards them as crucial and often brings them and the director flowers or notes of thanks. While Quentillius is a powerful presence on stage—especially in romantic roles—critics have called his performances histrionic. To better perform his future roles in ancient plays, Quentillius has joined the Dead Languages Society. He plans to perform his roles in the plays' original languages, regardless of whether the rest of the production is translated.

> [!quote] ...

> - **Bond Boon.** You have adopted Quentillius's authoritative voice, and in dire situations, your peers obey you when you issue commands.
> - **Bond Bane.** Whenever you perform as part of a production, a small crowd shows up and boos you specifically.
^150

#### Rosimyffenbip "Rosie" Wuzfeddlims

_Chaotic Good Gnome First Year (Lorehold_)

Excitable and impish, Rosimyffenbip is proud of her name; she insists you can call her "Rosie" only if you are her friend. Or a teacher. Or a student. Or any other member of the university staff. Rosie speaks quickly and with so much energy that it often takes a moment to recover from a conversation with her. She moves far faster than one would expect; it's unclear whether this is due to magic, a gnomish technological contraption, or just the laws of physics bending to Rosie's force of personality.

Rosie referees silkball and takes fair play very seriously. Woe betide any participant who feels the wrath of her whistle. Rosie is also an enthusiastic participant in Strixhaven's Live-Action Roleplaying Guild. She insists on roleplaying only "monsters" and delights in chasing down participants to "eat" them. Many a participant has heard giggling approaching them at high speed before their character's death.

> - **Bond Bane.** Whenever you participate in sports on campus (except for big events, such as the Battle of Strixhaven), fouls are constantly called on you.
^152

#### Rubina Larkingdale

_Lawful Neutral Human First Year (Silverquill_)

When Rubina walks into a room, people take notice. A measured performer with gravitas beyond her years, Rubina is a valued member of the Playactors Drama Guild who can handle weightier roles that more melodramatic actors can't. This has caused friction within the guild as members vie for parts. Rubina's stage presence extends to delivering presentations in class. When she orates, one can almost imagine a hardened general marshaling her bloodied and exhausted troops for a final push against a far superior foe.

Rubina is part of the Strixhaven Show Band Association and has moved from playing to conducting. No previous student conductor has demanded and received such unwavering respect as Rubina. With merely a look and a raised eyebrow, she can quiet even the most raucous orchestra sections.

> [!quote] ...

> - **Bond Bane.** Whenever any band performs in public, its members stop and shake their heads in disapproval when they see you.
^154

#### Shuvadri Glintmantle

_Lawful Good Owlin First Year (Silverquill_)

Her peers are often surprised when they learn Shuvadri is interested in joining Silverquill College, since its members sometimes earn a reputation as abrasive. Shuvadri, on the other hand, exhibits an air of absolute serenity. Anything that might frustrate or delight another student, whether it's a poor test score or success at a competition, elicits little outward response from Shuvadri. A deep thinker, Shuvadri is rarely surprised by such an outcome, and she enjoys being a centering presence for her peers.

Also a member of the Student-Mages of Faith, Shuvadri is happy to talk about her appreciation of deities who are devoted to service and community. Many of her peers think she is destined to hold high rank in a temple.

Shuvadri works on the campus grounds to erase graffiti, wearing a content smile on her face.

^156

#### Tilana Kapule

_Neutral Good Human First Year (Quandrix_)

Tilana's poised demeanor and steady gaze are remarkable. An excellent judge of character, she doesn't associate with those she deems mean-spirited. Her exacting judgment has led her to join the Dragonchess Club, and while she is still honing her skill at the game itself, she compensates by reading her opponent instead of the board. Many a foe has struggled to sit in silence as she gives them her full attention, probing for weaknesses, the pieces seemingly incidental.

Surprising to some, Tilana has also joined the Intramural Silkball Club. During matches, she focuses on trying to understand and preempt the opposing sides' strategies. More than once she has suggested new plays mid-game that have caught the opposing team off guard. The faculty at Strixhaven are convinced that, if she wished, one day Tilana would make an excellent professor.

> [!quote] ...

> - **Extracurriculars.** Dragonchess Club, Intramural Silkball Club

> - **Bond Bane.** The faculty don't trust you or help you much, for rumor has it that Tilana has found you wanting.
^158

#### Urzmaktok Grojsh

_Neutral Orc Second Year (Witherbloom_)

First to class, last to leave, and always asking for additional homework, Urzmaktok is a meticulous student. Despite his consistently high marks, Urzmaktok makes no attempt to show off, although his studies seem rudimentary to him. Rumor has it that he is completing enough credits to earn multiple degrees when he graduates.

Urzmaktok works for the Campus Magic Labs as a specimen preparer. This additional access to the labs also allows him to run his personal experiments in peace. Unsurprisingly, he is also a member of the Fantastical Horticulture Club. There, he looks to develop new species of plants that might yield new ingredients for potions.

Urzmaktok makes it clear he wants everyone to use his full first name. Should anyone use a nickname, he won't acknowledge the address.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> - **Extracurriculars.** Fantastical Horticulture Club
> - **Job.** Campus Magic Labs specimen preparer
> - **Bond Boon.** No matter the subject, you can always find a partner to study with, whether it's Urzmaktok or a classmate doing him a favor.
> - **Bond Bane.** No one on campus who isn't another player character will study with you. If you ask, most shrug decline, saying you'll probably fail.
^15a

#### Zanther Bowen

_Chaotic Good Fire Genasi First Year (Prismari_)

One of the most popular students on campus, Zanther is a member of the Mage Tower Cheer Squad, and his exceptional athleticism has earned him the position as the squad's primary flyer. As such, Zanther is launched into the air in elaborate cheering routines, much to the crowd's delight.

Zanther has also joined the Intramural Gymnastics Club. Here he completes at rhythmic gymnastics in both ribbon as well as hoop. To further test himself and impress the judges, Zanther conducts his routines to a vast array of different musical styles and arrangements. When traveling around campus between classes, he shouts random affirmations of school spirit to everyone at large. Despite his peppy nature, Zanther is genuinely encouraging and in no way acts superior. If anything, he seems somewhat oblivious to his own popularity at Strixhaven.
