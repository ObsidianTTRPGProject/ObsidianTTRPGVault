# Welcome to Ravenloft
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, p. 4* 

A scream shatters the still gloom. Inhuman shapes slip between crumbling tombs. The shadows reach forth. Do instincts and imagination conspire against you? Or have otherworldly evils claimed you, drawing you into the mists of Ravenloft?

In hidden corners of the Shadowfell are nightmare domains that hunger for the brave and the innocent, the ambitious and the wicked. Some call this collection of eerie realms the Land of the Mists, but monster hunters know it as Ravenloft. Terror, magic, mystery, and suspense fill these fractured domains, an infinite gallery of unfolding evils, age-old plots, cursed bloodlines, legendary monsters, and immortal villains. Evildoers from countless worlds regard Ravenloft as their prison—infamous figures such as the lich-king Azalin Rex, the unscrupulous scientist Viktra Mordenheim, and the diabolical first vampire Strahd von Zarovich. These Darklords wield incredible power within their isolated domains, yet they're held captive in eternal torment as victims of malign forces known as the Dark Powers.

Ravenloft is a fundamentally magical realm, one that takes its name from its most infamous haunted location, the dreaded Castle Ravenloft in Barovia—home of the notorious Strahd von Zarovich. In this mysterious setting, the land, the passage of time, the tides, and every other reliable truth can shift unpredictably. Rather than being bound by proximity or politics, the lands of Ravenloft—also known as the Domains of Dread—are mist-bound islands drifting through the boundless gloom of the Shadowfell. Innumerable domains lie hidden within these supernatural mists, and of these secret realms, the most terrifying are those born of your nightmares and given grim life through your adventures.

Although Ravenloft is a setting of storied evils, the domains aren't without heroes. Brave souls such as the investigator Ez d'Avenir, the monster-hunting Weathermay-Foxgrove sisters, and the scholar Rudolph van Richten explore the domains' secrets. Though few in number, such adventurers represent defiant lights that shine like beacons through the darkness, and characters from all lands and worlds may be eager—or compelled—to challenge the sinister forces lurking in the shadows.

The Mists of Ravenloft are rising. What mysteries will you discover among the Domains of Dread? What nightmares will you shape? And once you enter the Mists, will you ever escape?

### Horror in Your Game

Ominous shadows rise beyond the campfire's light. Steps echo through the halls of a supposedly empty house. Something whispers from under the stairs.

Consider the following topics and how this book can aid you in determining the role of suspense in your game.

#### Genres of Horror

Horror comes in broad varieties. You and your players decide what types of horror stories are right for your group. Do your prefer gothic moodiness, mind-bending mysteries, or something else entirely? Use this book to discover your group's perfect horror experience and how to bring it to life through your adventures.

Laurie used the talisman as you and Uncle George taught us, and it guided us through the Mists to Skald, a quaint, music-loving place in a land called Kartakass. The folk here are hospitable. Fawning actually. They hang on our every word. I've escaped their attentions by sequestering myself in our room at a local taverna while Laurie overindulges in attention for both of us. We've found no trace of Vhorishkova since arriving, but I feel her watching. It's like she's everywhere.

### Seven Secrets of Ravenloft

Countless mysteries pervade the Domains of Dread, but these strange truths underpin the setting:

- **1. Ravenloft Is Not a World.** The lands and characters of Ravenloft don't share a planet. Rather, the Domains of Dread consist of innumerable demiplanes hidden amid the Plane of Shadow. Mysterious Mists surround each of these island-realms. The bravest souls might creep from one domain to another, but doing so involves considerable danger, and many who enter the Mists are never seen again.
- **2. The Dark Powers Control All.** Sinister entities known as the Dark Powers manipulate the Domains of Dread and all who dwell within. Immortal, unknowable, and omnipotent, the Dark Powers revel in sowing terror and subtly manipulating their captives over the course of generations.
- **3. Domains Imprison Darklords.** Ravenloft's demiplanes range in size from solitary structures to vast regions. These domains serve as the prisons of Darklords, villainous beings trapped and tormented by the Dark Powers. The specifics of each domain exist to ironically twist its Darklord's desires, capturing them and their lands' residents in cycles of dread and despair.
- **4. The Mists Encompass All.** Supernatural haze suffuses the Domains of Dread. These are the Mists of Ravenloft, ominous fogs that gird each domain, rising and falling as the Dark Powers desire. Tales attribute ominous powers to the Mists, from cloaking monsters to causing entire villages to vanish. The Mists are not bound to Ravenloft and slip across the planes, potentially dragging anyone into the Domains of Dread.
- **5. Nowhere Is Safe.** The Mists of Ravenloft are notorious for kidnapping innocent souls and trapping them within the Domains of Dread, but they also collect characters to participate in specific terrifying adventures. Ravenloft can claim a soul for one night of terror or for an inescapable nightmare, whichever suits the needs of your adventures.
- **6. Heroes Confront Horrors.** Ravenloft is not a land of heroes. Few seek out danger in the Mists or challenge Darklords. Fear and forces within characters themselves—potentially in the form of rare lineages or Dark Gifts—threaten personal dooms. Yet those who face these terrors shine as lights amid the Mists, beacons to attract other heroes but also greater threats.
- **7. Only Fear Is Certain.** The Domains of Dread provide malleable settings for any kind of horror adventure. As domains are unmoored from conventional reality, anything can happen within their borders. Normal people undergo terrifying transformations, whole villages disappear unnoticed, and the Mists bar every method of escaping a threat. Any surreal development you desire is also the will of the Dark Powers, assuring that the most terrifying possibilities come to pass. As a result, even the most familiar races, magic items, and monsters in the "Player's Handbook", "Dungeon Master's Guide", and "Monster Manual" have places in Ravenloft, but with twists that make them creepy or mysterious.

## The Land of the Mists

Although the Domains of Dread are dramatically different, certain realities underpin their terrors. The nature of domains, the influence of Darklords, the mysteries of the Mists, and the machinations of the Dark Powers present a wealth of ominous possibilities. All these elements share a shadowy uncertainty and the potential for terror to take on unpredictable forms.

The following sections are written for you, the DM, to consider and incorporate into your adventures as you see fit. If you wish to reveal the core mysteries of Ravenloft to your players and explore the Land of the Mists with shared knowledge, by all means do so. Alternatively, you can cultivate dread by leaving the fundamental truths of the world vague or defined by your group's theories. Deep shadows immerse the Domains of Dread. Whether you cast light on them or leave them an inky mystery, their potential for terror remains endless.

This section provides an overview of the dreadful forces at work in Ravenloft, elements the following chapters explore as tools for crafting horror adventures. For details on specific Domains of Dread and interactions between these realms, see "chapter 3".

### Nightmare Logic

By the standards of what other worlds' inhabitants consider true and sane, the Domains of Dread don't make sense. The setting's domains don't neatly flow into one another, histories don't record a collectively remembered past, fictions spawn terrible facts, and sheltered villagers remain stubbornly ignorant about the world beyond. Ravenloft is a setting designed to cultivate uncertainty, mystery, paranoia, and dread in defiance of logic or common sense.

The characters in your Ravenloft adventures might be the first to inquire after obvious inconsistencies or to notice plain impossibilities. But why has no one before them sought answers to such unignorable questions? The Dark Powers, the Mists, and the nature of domains and Darklords all claim part of the answer, but ultimately they reflect aspects of the same cause: nightmare logic.

Ravenloft is inherently a vast nightmare. Most of those who experience its terrors never suspect its surreal nature; only a few gradually realize that things don't add up. Whether they do or don't, the setting's supernatural features and malicious masterminds exist to foster terror. The details described in this section are true, but truth is malleable in Ravenloft. The exact limits of the Dark Powers' influence, the Mists' reach, and the Darklords' control over their domains are purposefully vague.

As with any nightmare, the Domains of Dread aren't shackled to the laws of reality. Domains exist not to simulate a believable world, but to terrify. This flexibility provides a powerful tool to upend assumptions of safety and tailor your characters' struggles. It also encourages layers of mysteries about the nature of the setting. Is each domain unique or just one in a series of recurring nightmares? How many forms of Castle Ravenloft exist, have existed, and will yet reveal themselves in the Mists? What is truth among the Domains of Dread, and how long will that remain certain? The answers are for you to decide.

> 
> Ravenloft is a setting designed to bring nightmares to life—for characters, not for players. While the Land of the Mists is rife with sinister plots and terrifying tales, they're meant to stay within the world of your game, not to prey upon the fears of players. "Chapter 4" details ways to make sure you're crafting adventures that are spooky in ways your players will enjoy. "Chapter 1" also provides guidance for players so they can work together to create horror experiences that are safe and fun for the entire group. Revisit these considerations and safety tools often, until they're just as much a part of your game as character sheets and dice.
> 
> **Content Warning.** With this in mind, be aware that this book contains suggestions for adventures meant to be horrifying. While these plots are no more explicit than those you might find in any other Dungeons & Dragons product, the horror genre in all its myriad forms is explored—from moody gothic horror and ghost stories to visceral body horror and mind-bending cosmic horror. "Chapter 2" explores how to choose the horror themes that are right for your game, but read on at your discretion.

### The Dark Powers

Unfathomable, hidden forces manipulate life, death, and reality within Ravenloft. These mysterious, deathless beings are the architects of the Domains of Dread, and have secreted these pockets of terror deep within the Plane of Shadow. The Dark Powers watch and influence events within their dominion. When their gaze drifts, they reach into other planes to collect heroes and villains to add to their terrifying menagerie. To what end, no one knows.

The Dark Powers don't move in the shadows of Ravenloft; they are the shadows. They're the Mists and the darkness. They're the reason water manifests as rivers and stars appear in skies divorced from universes. They are the wardens that hold the Darklords prisoner. Ever-present and inscrutable, the Dark Powers are akin to gods in Ravenloft, but they are unknown to mortals and desire no worship.

Despite the control the Dark Powers exert, these beings remain distant from the domains they manipulate. Although some of their names whisper through sinister lore—names like Osybus, Shami-Amourae, and Tenebrous—domain inhabitants know almost nothing of the Dark Powers. While some Darklords realize they're imprisoned by antagonistic entities, discourse regarding the Dark Powers remains the province of soothsayers, obsessed scholars, and otherworldly beings. Anyone who spreads tales of sinister forces manipulating reality is ignored or worse. For residents of Ravenloft, ignorance provides a well-defended shelter against unfathomable truths.

#### The Secret of the Dark Powers

The true nature of the Dark Powers is for you to decide. How you perceive these forces can influence your view of their actions and agendas, who they abduct into Ravenloft and why. Through your adventures, you might reveal these mysteries and use them to hint at ways to escape the Domains of Dread. Consider the following possibilities when developing your perspective on the Dark Powers:

- **Amoral Guardians.** The Dark Powers are a group of powerful beings who believe they're beyond morality. They identify dangerous individuals and imprison them within the Domains of Dread, where they ostensibly do less harm than they would if they were free. Those trapped along with the Darklords are acceptable sacrifices.
- **Evil Architects.** The Dark Powers are embodiments of evil, mysterious entities of the Plane of Shadow, or a conspiracy of wicked gods. They treat the denizens of the Domains of Dread as their playthings, sowing fears and fomenting despair. This pleases or sustains them, or perhaps they're searching for individuals worthy of joining their ranks.
- **Undying Remnants.** The Dark Powers are all that remain of a multitude of vanquished evil deities and demigods. Traces of their power linger in amber sarcophagi scattered throughout the Domains of Dread. These diminished vestiges manipulate their realm to create negative forces that sustain their essence and build toward renewed apotheosis.

### The Mists

Known throughout Ravenloft, the Mists are manifestations of the Dark Powers' will. They divide, surround, and isolate every domain, creating fog-shrouded borders that imprison Darklords within their territories. The Mists slip through the Domains of Dread, rising to claim unwitting travelers or releasing terrors upon unsuspecting villagers. Most infamously, the Mists slither into other worlds to claim innocents, villains, or whole lands, dragging them back to become the newest prisoners of Ravenloft.

Inhabitants of the Domains of Dread know of the Mists and ascribe sinister stories to them, but they accept the Mists as a natural part of their homeland. Many who travel between domains even refer to their world as the Land of the Mists. Any supernatural happening, inexplicable disappearance, or malicious force can be blamed on the Mists, and those who interact with the Mists or who come from beyond them are met with suspicion. The Mists confound travel between domains, whether one wishes to leave a place to reach another land or to escape the realm they're in.

Beyond these truths, the Mists are your tool to establish the boundaries of your horror stories. See the ""Nature of Ravenloft"" section in "chapter 3" for details on employing the Mists to focus your horror adventures, leading characters to engage with certain elements while cloaking others in mystery.

### Domains

Sinister demiplanes known as domains constitute the realms of Ravenloft. These domains vary widely, but they share a number of common features:

- **Domains Are Finite.** The domains vary in size from countries or geographic regions to a single city, structure, mobile conveyance, or specific location.
- **Domains Are Isolated.** Each domain is surrounded by the Mists, its boundaries fading away into haze. Domains share neither borders nor common geography, and you can't peer from one domain into another. The environments, cultures, and residents of one domain don't influence those of other domains.
- **Domains Hold Darklords.** Domains exist to contain and torment a villain. Though Darklords exert control over their domains, they are each tormented by a personal terror playing out in their realm.
- **Domains Are Cages.** Those who run afoul of a Darklord might find that the Mists prevent them from leaving the villain's domain. Like a haunted house that conveniently seals its doors or summons a deadly storm, so do domains create inescapable spaces where horror adventures unfold.
- **Domains Are Themed.** Each domain reflects its Darklord and facilitates horror tales related to that villain. Just as creepy manors suit ghostly inhabitants, so does each domain inspire and encourage a distinct type of terror.

Details on how to create your own domains appear in "chapter 2", while "chapter 3" describes some of the most notorious Domains of Dread.

> [!quote] Cultivating Hope
> 
> In Ravenloft, the Dark Powers control reality, the Mists foil escape attempts, and terrifying Darklords can appear at any moment. What hope do heroes have against such overwhelming evils?
> 
> The nature of Ravenloft provides powerful tools to craft tales of terror. Shifting reality, inescapable danger, and foes with shocking powers are useful for creating horror adventures (a topic further discussed in "chapter 4"). As a balancing factor, use these tools judiciously and occasionally, in the characters' favor. The Dark Powers delight in tormenting villains as much as they do innocents, the Mists equally confound both predators and prey, and Darklords frequently exhibit hubris or other exploitable flaws. Use Ravenloft's nature to sow dread but also to inspire hope. Relentless despair gradually beats characters down and takes the fun out of adventures. Punctuate your horror tales with moments of relief, comedy, and fortuitous coincidences. These moments of hope help characters push through the dark to the thrill of dawn.

### Darklords

Central to each domain is a Darklord, the seed from which a thorny thicket blooms. The villain might be a nation's leader, a prominent citizen, a notorious monster, a mysterious recluse, or a seemingly innocuous character. Regardless of the Darklord's current role, their wickedness led to the creation of their domain and their imprisonment in Ravenloft.

Though these individuals vary widely and exceptions occur, Darklords share a number of qualities:

- **Darklords Are Evil.** Each Darklord is the ultimate villain of a domain and the root of the suffering and terror that unfold there.
- **Darklords Are Prisoners.** Darklords cannot leave their domains. If a Darklord enters the Mists or uses another method to attempt an escape, the Dark Powers return them to their domain. Even death rarely allows a Darklord to escape their prison for long.
- **Darklords Are Tormented.** Every domain torments its Darklord in a poignant way tied ironically to their past crimes, failures, or unattainable ambitions.
- **Darklords Influence Domains.** Although Darklords hate their domains, they exert considerable control over them. This might be the influence of a governmental leader, the magic of a supernatural overlord, or a more fundamental connection. Most possess the ability to prevent others from leaving their domains (further explored in ""The Nature of Ravenloft"" in "chapter 3").
- **Darklords Vary in Threat.** Darklords range from monstrous tyrants to depraved individuals who otherwise appear as ordinary people. A Darklord's position and powers stem from their deeds, not their game statistics. While some Darklords are deadly or possess foul gifts from the Dark Powers, many pose little threat in battle. Their menace is the result of capabilities beyond physical prowess.
- **Darklords Are Active.** Darklords might brood over their failures, but nevertheless they relentlessly strive to achieve their ambitions. Their desperate struggles fuel their conflicts with characters. Liberally use Darklords in your adventures rather than saving them for distant climactic plots.
- **Darklords Don't Realize They're Darklords.** With a few exceptions, Darklords don't realize they occupy a special place in the world. Their agendas, obsessions, and egotism distract them from focusing on the strangeness of the world and petty concerns such as eerie fog.
- **Darklords Are Immortal.** Darklords are casually immortal, many having no concept of how long they've lived, how many times they've died, or why they returned to life. Should a Darklord fall, the temporary defeat lasts until they're restored by the Dark Powers. In their absence, those who sought to escape or supplant them seize their chance.

### Adventurers

The Domains of Dread don't typically breed heroes. For the inhabitants of most domains, simply surviving the night is an act of courage. Those willing to confront the terrors of the Mists are rare, but when they do, they have one of the following origins:

- **Mist Wanderers.** The Mists reached into these characters' worlds and dragged them into the Domains of Dread. Whether these adventurers are trapped in Ravenloft for a night or an eternity, their spirits mark them as outsiders but also as rare beacons in the endless darkness.
- **Roused Locals.** Some shock jarred these unusual individuals from the apathy pervasive to the Land of the Mists. Witnesses to evil, these characters will never know the solace of ignorance again. "Chapter 3" explores details on creating characters unique to various domains.

Adventurers find few peers in the Land of the Mists. While there are exceptions—many of whom are illustrated throughout this book and detailed in "chapter 3"—such individuals are few and their lives are often short. Guilds of adventurers and shops catering to their needs generally don't exist. As a result, the challenge of confronting evil rests squarely with a few rare souls. Read on to "chapter 1" for details on creating your own haunted heroes.

I haven't said it enough, but I love you all like my own. For what it's worth, I consider you all van Richtens now.
