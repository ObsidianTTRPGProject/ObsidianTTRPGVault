# Appendix: Spirit Board
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, p. 256* 

Employed by the spiritualists known as the "Keepers of the Feather" (see "chapter 3"), spirit boards are the focal points of séances and attempts to contact worlds beyond. Spirit board users rely on the collective will of those who assemble around the board and join hands upon its planchette to commune with mysterious forces.

This spirit board's matching planchette and details on how to employ it appear in "chapter 4". Photocopy both the spirit board and planchette then apply them to wood or cardboard to create a mysterious prop for use in your horror adventures.
