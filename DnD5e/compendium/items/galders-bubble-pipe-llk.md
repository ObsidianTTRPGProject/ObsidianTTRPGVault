# Galder's Bubble Pipe
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This finely carved pipe blows odorless bubbles instead of smoke when used. The pipe has 3 charges, and it regains all spent charges daily at dawn. While you hold the pipe, you can expend charges to gain access to the following properties:

- You can cast [fog cloud](/compendium/spells/fog-cloud.md) as an action (1 charge).
- You can cast [misty step](/compendium/spells/misty-step.md) as a bonus action (2 charges).
- You can summon a [steam mephit](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/steam-mephit.md) as an action (3 charges). The mephit is friendly to you, obeys your verbal commands, and acts on its own turn in the initiative order. It disappears in a harmless puff of steam after 1 minute or if it ends its turn more than 60 feet from the pipe.
