# Quaal's Feather Token, Whip
*Wondrous Item, minor, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect.

## Whip

You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are [incapacitated](/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) or die.
