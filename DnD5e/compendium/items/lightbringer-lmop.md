# Lightbringer
*Melee Weapon, uncommon*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B

- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This +1 mace was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a [torch](/compendium/items/torch.md) when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage to undead creatures.
