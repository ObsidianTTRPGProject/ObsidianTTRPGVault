# Instrument of the Bards, Fochlucan Bandore
*Instrument, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [fly](/compendium/spells/fly.md), [invisibility](/compendium/spells/invisibility.md), [levitate](/compendium/spells/levitate.md), and [protection from evil and good](/compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md).

In addition, the Fochlucan bandore can be used to cast [entangle](/compendium/spells/entangle.md), [faerie fire](/compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md), [shillelagh](/compendium/spells/shillelagh.md), and [speak with animals](/compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md).
