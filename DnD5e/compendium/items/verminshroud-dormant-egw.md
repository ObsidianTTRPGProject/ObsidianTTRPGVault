# Verminshroud (Dormant)
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This patchy cloak was pieced together from the pelts of rats found feasting on the dead in Blightshore and is dotted with the bloated corpses of magically preserved insects along its seams.

## Dormant

While wearing the Verminshroud in its dormant state, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on smell, you are immune to disease, and you have [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision), wearing the cloak increases the range of your [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) by 60 feet.
- As an action, you can use the Verminshroud to cast [polymorph](/compendium/spells/polymorph.md) on yourself, transforming into a [giant rat](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-rat.md) or [rat](/compendium/bestiary/beast/rat.md) while retaining your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as the properties of the cloak. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
