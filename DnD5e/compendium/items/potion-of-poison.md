# Potion of Poison
*Potion, minor, uncommon, poison*  

- **Properties**: [Poison](/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [potion of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md) or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An [identify](/compendium/spells/identify.md) spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). At the start of each of your turns while you are [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
