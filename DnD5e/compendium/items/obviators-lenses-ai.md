# Obviator's Lenses
*Wondrous Item, varies*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Also at rank 2, you gain the use of an uncommon magic item taking the form of a pair of spectacles, a spyglass, a monocle, or any other device with one or two lenses. When you look through the obviator's lenses, you use a bonus action to make them function as [eyes of minute seeing](/compendium/items/eyes-of-minute-seeing.md) or [eyes of the eagle](/compendium/items/eyes-of-the-eagle.md). Once you make this choice, it cannot be changed until the next dawn.

## Enhanced Lenses

At rank 4, your obviator's lenses gain additional power and become a rare magic item. The lenses now function as both [eyes of the eagle](/compendium/items/eyes-of-the-eagle.md) and [eyes of minute seeing](/compendium/items/eyes-of-minute-seeing.md).

Additionally, you can focus the power of the lenses to gain accuracy in combat, gaining advantage on a weapon attack roll (no action required). If that attack hits, roll one additional weapon damage die. This property of the lenses can't be used again until the next dawn.
