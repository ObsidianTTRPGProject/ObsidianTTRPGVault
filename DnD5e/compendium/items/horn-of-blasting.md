# Horn of Blasting
*Wondrous Item, major, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is [deafened](/rules/conditions.md#deafened) for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [deafened](/rules/conditions.md#deafened). Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20% chance chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.
