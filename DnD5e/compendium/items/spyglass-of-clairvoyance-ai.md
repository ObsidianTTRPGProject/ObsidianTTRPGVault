# Spyglass of Clairvoyance
*Wondrous Item, common*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

At rank 2, your Head Office-supplied spyglass becomes a common magic item. As an action, you can look through the spyglass of clairvoyance at a location within 1 mile of you that is obstructing your view, such as a mountain, castle, or forest. You must then succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom check using [cartographer's tools](/compendium/items/cartographers-tools.md) to map the natural terrain found within three miles of that chosen point. You do not gain any knowledge of creatures, structures, or anything other than natural terrain. This property of the spyglass cannot be used again until the next dawn.
