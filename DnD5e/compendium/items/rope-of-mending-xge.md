# Rope of Mending
*Wondrous Item, minor, common*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

You can cut this 50-foot coil of hempen rope into any number of smaller pieces, and then use an action to speak a command word and cause the pieces to knit back together. The pieces must be in contact with each other and not otherwise in use. A rope of mending is forever shortened if a section of it is lost or destroyed.
