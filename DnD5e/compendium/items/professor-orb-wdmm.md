# Professor Orb
*Wondrous Item, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

Each professor orb takes the form of a smooth, solid, 5-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere.

A Professor Orb is sentient and has the personality of a scholar. Its alignment is determined by rolling on the alignment table in the ""Sentient Magic Items"" section in chapter 7 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide". Regardless of its disposition, the orb has an Intelligence of 18, and Wisdom and Charisma scores determined by rolling 3d6 for each ability. The orb speaks, reads, and understands four languages, and can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of its own and can't initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.

A Professor Orb has extensive knowledge of four narrow academic subjects. When making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).

In addition to the knowledge it possesses, a professor orb can cast the [mage hand](/compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence.
