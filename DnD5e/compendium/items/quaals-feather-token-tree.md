# Quaal's Feather Token, Tree
*Wondrous Item, minor, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect.

## Tree

You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.
