This black leather apron is perpetually covered by blood, even after being washed off. You gain the following benefits while wearing the apron:

- Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee attack with a weapon, you can reroll the weapon's damage dice. If you do so, you must use the second total.
- Your weapon attacks that deal slashing damage score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
