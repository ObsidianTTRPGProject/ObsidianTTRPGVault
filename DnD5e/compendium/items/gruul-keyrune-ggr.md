# Gruul Keyrune
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a member of the Gruul guild)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a [rhinoceros](/compendium/bestiary/beast/rhinoceros.md) (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.

When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform.

The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.

At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.
