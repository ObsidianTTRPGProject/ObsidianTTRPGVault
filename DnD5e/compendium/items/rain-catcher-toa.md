# Rain Catcher
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 1 gp
- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

A rain catcher is a simple contraption consisting of a 5-foot-square leather tarp and a wooden frame with legs. When the tarp is stretched across the wooden frame, it forms a basin that can catch 2 gallons of drinking water per inch of rainfall and hold up to 8 gallons. The tarp and wooden frame fold up for easy transport.
