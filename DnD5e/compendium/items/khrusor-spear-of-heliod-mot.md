Heliod wields Khrusor, a spear blessed with the power of the sun. In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it's typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness.

## Spear of the Sun

This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

## Blessing of the Sun

If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

- **Piety 3+.** You gain 15 temporary hit points each dawn.
- **Piety 10+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property.
- **Piety 25+.** The spear has 1 additional randomly determined Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties property.
- **Piety 50+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties property.

If you aren't a worshiper of Heliod, the spear has 2 randomly determined Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties properties.

See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.

## Luminous

The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.

## Sun's Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Spells

The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [guiding bolt](/compendium/spells/guiding-bolt.md) (1 charge), [daylight](/compendium/spells/daylight.md) (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), [sunbeam](/compendium/spells/sunbeam.md) (6 charges). The spear regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Destroying the Spear

If taken to Erebos's palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos's service.
