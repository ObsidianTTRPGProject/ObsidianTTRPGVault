# The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad
*Wondrous Item, artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.

Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.

The Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.

## Silver Wire

The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an [astral projection](/compendium/spells/astral-projection.md) spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible), astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.

As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an [astral projection](/compendium/spells/astral-projection.md)'s silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.

Any effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.

## Summon Monster

When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:

- 1/day: [conjure animals](/compendium/spells/conjure-animals.md), [summon lesser demons](/compendium/spells/summon-lesser-demons-xge.md)
- 1/7 days: [conjure minor elementals](/compendium/spells/conjure-minor-elementals.md), [conjure woodland beings](/compendium/spells/conjure-woodland-beings.md), [summon greater demon](/compendium/spells/summon-greater-demon-xge.md)
- 1/month: [conjure elemental](/compendium/spells/conjure-elemental.md), [conjure fey](/compendium/spells/conjure-fey.md)

## Wish

The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10|10 percent% chance chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.

## Random Properties

There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.

Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long rest.

(Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!)

## Destroying the Machine

The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.

At your determination, you can transfer some or all of this damage to any creatures that took a short rest with you and remained within 30 feet of you for the duration. |
| 90 | Each time you finish a short rest, you find 1d10 small gems worth 10 gp each in your possession. | Whenever you spend coins or gems, any character you give them to becomes convinced that the wealth was stolen from them. |
| 91 | When you hit a creature for the first time during an encounter, its Armor Class is reduced by 1. | Whenever you roll a 1 on a weapon attack roll, the weapon shatters like glass. The weapon magically reforms in 1d4 rounds. |
| 92 | Each time you enter a settlement, you are treated as though you are known there and a friend, even if you are neither. | Each time you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you grow one inch taller. Your clothing and armor does not grow with you. |
| 93 | While standing in a doorway, you can cast the [teleport](/compendium/spells/teleport.md) spell. Your destination must be another doorway you know. You can use this property once. | Each time you finish a short rest, you forget one of your allies (of the DM's choice) and no longer trust that character. You lose this distrust at the end of your next short rest. |
| 94 | As an action, you cause a swirling storm of rocks and dust to surround you in a 10-foot radius for 1 minute. Each creature hostile to you that enters the area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and be [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 round. You can use this property three times. | [Fire elementals](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md), [water elementals](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md), and other creatures of fire and water (as determined by the DM) regard you as their enemy, and focus their attacks against you to the exclusion of all else. |
| 95 | As an action, you learn the names of every humanoid creature within 30 feet of you. | Whenever you roll a 1 on a Strength or Dexterity check that incorporates touching an object, you stick to that object for 1 minute. It takes a successful DC 20 Strength check to free yourself. |
| 96 | You can cast the [modify memory](/compendium/spells/modify-memory.md) spell once. | Whenever you make an Intelligence check or saving throw, you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or lose all your memories of the past hour. |
| 97 | You can ignore the verbal component of any spell you cast. | You must shout the verbal component of any spell you cast. |
| 98 | As an action, you conjure a mindless, shapeless force that is your exact duplicate. You control this force as if it were the product of an [unseen servant](/compendium/spells/unseen-servant.md) spell, except that it is visible. | Each time you see your own reflection, you must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you treat your allies as enemies and vice versa for 1 minute, attacking the wrong targets, betraying your companions in social situations, and so forth. You can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns, ending the effect on a success. |
| 99 | As an action, you can replace one of your hands with any nonmagical weapon, tool, or piece of adventuring equipment of reasonable size (as determined by the DM). | Your hands feel unnaturally large, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) checks and Dexterity checks using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) or artisan's tools. The first weapon attack roll you make in any encounter is made with disadvantage. |
| 00 | All creatures of a particular type other than humanoid (as chosen by the DM) are incapable of acting hostile toward you as long as you do not attack, threaten, or provoke them. | Whenever you meet a creature of a particular type other than humanoid (as chosen by the DM), there is a 1 percent cumulative chance that the [tarrasque](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tarrasque.md) is magically summoned within 1 mile of you. The tarrasque has no knowledge of your existence. It runs amok for 1d6 × 10 minutes, then magically returns to its previous location. |
