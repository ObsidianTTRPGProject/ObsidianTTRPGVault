# Biza's Breath
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Properties**: [Poison](/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no other creature within its reach, the [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature does nothing on its turn. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
