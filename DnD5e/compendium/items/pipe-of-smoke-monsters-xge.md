# Pipe of Smoke Monsters
*Wondrous Item, minor, common*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While smoking this pipe, you can use an action to exhale a puff of smoke that takes the form of a single creature, such as a dragon, a flumph, or a froghemoth. The form must be small enough to fit in a 1-foot cube and loses its shape after a few seconds, becoming an ordinary puff of smoke.
