The focus gains an additional property determined by the family of the dragon in whose hoard it became Stirring:

- **Chromatic.** Whenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus equal to the number rolled to one of the spell's damage rolls.
- **Gem.** Whenever you use a spell slot to cast a spell, you can immediately teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you.
- **Metallic.** When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to give that creature advantage on the saving throw.
