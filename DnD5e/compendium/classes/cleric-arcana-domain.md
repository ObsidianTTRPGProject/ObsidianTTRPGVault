# Arcana Domain
*Cleric: Divine Domain*  
*Source: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 125*  


Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.

The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include [Azuth](/compendium/deities/faerunian-azuth.md) and [Mystra](/compendium/deities/faerunian-mystra.md), as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes [Hecate](/compendium/deities/greek-hecate.md), [Math Mathonwy](/compendium/deities/celtic-math-mathonwy.md), and [Isis](/compendium/deities/egyptian-isis.md); the triple moon gods of [Solinari](/compendium/deities/dragonlance-solinari.md), [Lunitari](/compendium/deities/dragonlance-lunitari.md), and [Nuitari](/compendium/deities/dragonlance-nuitari.md) of Krynn; and [Boccob](/compendium/deities/greyhawk-boccob.md), Vecna, and [Wee Jas](/compendium/deities/greyhawk-wee-jas.md) of Greyhawk.

At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

## Arcane Initiate

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the [Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. For you, these cantrips count as cleric cantrips.

## Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, then the creature can use the Dodge action.

After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the [banishment](/compendium/spells/banishment.md) spell, no concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of origin, and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown below.

**Arcane Banishment**

| Cleric level | Banishes Creatures of CR... |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| 5th | 1/2 or lower |
| 8th | 1 or lower |
| 11th | 2 or lower |
| 14th | 3 or lower |
| 17th | 4 or lower |
^arcane-banishment

## Spell Breaker

Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

## Potent Spellcasting (Level 8)

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

## Blessed Strikes (Level 8)

_8th-level cleric optional class features, which replaces the Potent Spellcasting feature_

You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

## Arcane Mastery

At 17th level, you choose four spells from the Wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.
