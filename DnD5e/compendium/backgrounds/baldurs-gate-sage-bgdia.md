# Baldur's Gate Sage
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 204*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana), [History](/rules/skills.md#History)
- **Languages.** Two of your choice
- **Equipment.** A [bottle of black ink](/compendium/items/ink-1-ounce-bottle.md), a quill, a small knife, a letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have not yet been able to answer, a set of [common clothes](/compendium/items/common-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/compendium/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp

Baldur's Gate has a modest academic community centered around the libraries of the High Hall and the various temples dedicated to gods of learning and innovation. Lecturers, researchers, and historians all participate with passing scholars from Candlekeep in a lively exchange of ideas, debating and collaborating in book-filled halls across the Upper and Lower City. The city is also rife with opportunities for arcane study, although its masters are dispersed across individual wizards' abodes and lack concentrated communities.

## Feature: Researcher

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

## Baldur's Gate Feature: Rumor Monger

> [!note]
> The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.

Via your personal rumor mill and articles published in Baldur's Mouth, you can surmise a great deal about Baldurians' secrets—who's practicing necromancy, who's involved in spying or smuggling, who would purchase or craft dangerous magical wares without batting an eyelash. Whenever a noteworthy crime or mysterious happening occurs in the city, you immediately have a list of 1d4 suspects who, if they aren't involved, have a strong chance of knowing who is.

## Suggested Characteristics

Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other ideals.
