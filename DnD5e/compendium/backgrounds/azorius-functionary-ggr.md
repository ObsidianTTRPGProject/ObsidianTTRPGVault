# Azorius Functionary
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 33*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight), [Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Languages.** Two of your choice
- **Equipment.** An Azorius insignia, a scroll containing the text of a law important to you, a [bottle of blue ink](/compendium/items/ink-1-ounce-bottle.md), a [pen](/compendium/items/ink-pen.md), a set of [fine clothes](/compendium/items/fine-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/compendium/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp (Azorius-minted 1-zino coins)

The brutes are at the gate, chaos is looming, and the only thing standing in the way of disaster is the foundation of law and order—as embodied in the Azorius Senate. You're a proud member of the Azorius guild, which both enacts and enforces the laws that make Ravnican society function smoothly and safely.

## Feature: Legal Authority

You have the authority to enforce the laws of Ravnica, and that status inspires a certain amount of respect and even fear in the populace. People mind their manners in your presence and avoid drawing your attention; they assume you have the right to be wherever you are. Showing your Azorius insignia gets you an audience with anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more problems than it solves when you're dealing with incorrigible lawbreakers). If you abuse this privilege, though, you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and even be stripped of your position.

## Azorius Guild Spells

_Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature_

For you, the spells on the Azorius Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

**Azorius Guild Spells**

| Spell Level | Spells |
|-------------|--------|
| Cantrip | [friends](/compendium/spells/friends.md), [message](/compendium/spells/message.md) |
| 1st | [command](/compendium/spells/command.md), [ensnaring strike](/compendium/spells/ensnaring-strike.md) |
| 2nd | [arcane lock](/compendium/spells/arcane-lock.md), [calm emotions](/compendium/spells/calm-emotions.md), [hold person](/compendium/spells/hold-person.md) |
| 3rd | [clairvoyance](/compendium/spells/clairvoyance.md), [counterspell](/compendium/spells/counterspell.md) |
| 4th | [compulsion](/compendium/spells/compulsion.md), [divination](/compendium/spells/divination.md) |
| 5th | [dominate person](/compendium/spells/dominate-person.md) |
^azorius-guild-spells

Your magic often takes the form of blue or golden runes floating and glowing in the air in circular patterns or of shimmering azure barriers of magical energy. If you cast [ensnaring strike](/compendium/spells/ensnaring-strike.md), for example, the vines created by the spell might appear as rune-inscribed glowing bands that wrap around the target and hold it in place.

## Contacts

The Azorius Senate is a sprawling bureaucracy, and people in a variety of positions throughout the guild can pull strings to make things happen. Because of the guild's role in making and enforcing laws for the entire city, your place in the Azorius can easily bring you into contact with members of other guilds, for good or ill.

Roll twice on the Azorius Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Azorius Contacts table.

**Azorius Contacts**

| dice: d8 | Contact |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | As a teenager, I was a page for a prominent judge. |
| 2 | One of my childhood friends is now a precognitive mage in service of the guild. |
| 3 | I joined the Azorius hoping to impress an arrester whom I admire. |
| 4 | My former mentor is now a warden at Udzec, the new Azorius prison. |
| 5 | I was second best at everything in my legal training, and now I work with the person who was always just a little bit better. |
| 6 | A good friend was promoted into work they can't tell me about. |
| 7 | I know a homunculus in the halls of New Prahv who can get things done behind the scenes. |
| 8 | I was once summoned to the presence of Supreme Judge Isperia, the guildmaster of the Azorius, who complimented me on my work. |

## How Do I Fit In?

As a member of the Azorius Senate, you are probably engaged in the work of law enforcement (even if your background involved the legislative or judicial aspects of the senate's activities). Legislative aides and judges' clerks find little reason to venture beyond the Azorius guildhalls, but soldiers and lawmages patrol the streets daily.

An Azorius soldier or lawmage is a force for order, charged with fighting crime on the streets—and in the halls of power. You might spend your time foiling thefts, putting a stop to Orzhov extortion, rooting out Dimir spies, or hunting down Golgari assassins. Perhaps you take your orders from a precognitive mage (or you are one yourself) who receives unpredictable and cryptic visions of future crimes that you and your allies must try to prevent.
