# Baldur's Gate Urchin
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 204*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand), [Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)
- **Tool Proficiencies.** [Disguise kit](/compendium/items/disguise-kit.md), [Thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md)
- **Equipment.** A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of [common clothes](/compendium/items/common-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/compendium/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp

Bands of orphans and runaways band together in the Outer City, running after passersby in ragged throngs to plead for scraps. In the Lower City, urchins are often recruited into the lowest echelons of the Guild or pressed into dirty and dangerous work by unscrupulous masters.

## Feature: City Secrets

You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.

## Baldur's Gate Feature: Gateguide Connection

> [!note]
> The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.

Even though you might not be a member of the Gateguides crew, you've associated with enough of them that you know their torch-based code. From the lighting, placement, and type of torch arranged on or near a structure, you can gather a great deal of information about those who live or do business there, particularly if they deal fairly with strangers, have Guild or government connections, or have either helped or denied the Gateguides in the past.

## Suggested Characteristics

Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life—and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.
