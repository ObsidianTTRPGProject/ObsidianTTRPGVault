You are one of the hundreds of small-time fishermen and women who haul the bounty of Mulmaster's freshwater harbor to the city's markets each morning. You have spent countless days rowing in the waters in and around Mulmaster and know them and the other fisherfolk, dockworkers, and port inhabitants better than anyone. Though you have left that life behind, you still visit once in a while.

## Overview

You are one of the hundreds of small-time fishermen and women who haul the bounty of Mulmaster's freshwater harbor to the city's markets each morning. You have spent countless days rowing in the waters in and around Mulmaster and know them and the other fisherfolk, dockworkers, and port inhabitants better than anyone. Though you have left that life behind, you still visit once in a while.

## Feature: Harborfolk

You grew up on the docks and waters of Mulmaster Harbor. The harborfolk remember you and still treat you as one of them. They welcome you and your companions. While they might charge you for it, they'll always offer what food and shelter they have; they'll even hide you if the City Watch is after you (but not if the Hawks are). Note: This feature is a variant of the Folk Hero feature.

|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I am curious. I want to know why things are the way they are and why people do the things that they do. |

| 3 | I think the High Blade is doing a terrific job, don't you? |
| 4 | I'm very excited that the House Built on Gold is being restored. I am a zealous worshipper of Waukeen. |

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Calm. For all things, there is a tide. I set sail when it is right, and mend my nets when it is not. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Windblown. I go where the winds blow. No man or woman tells me where or when to sail. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | Aspiring. I will gain the favor of a Zor or Zora patron, maybe even one of the Blades! (Any) |
| 4 | Salty. I want people to look to me as an expert on plying Mulmaster Harbor. (Any) |
| 5 | Selfless. We are all children of the sea. I help everyone in peril afloat and ashore. (Good) |
| 6 | Let them Drown. I refuse to risk my hide to help others. They wouldn't help me if roles were reversed. (Evil) |
