# Augen Trust (Spy)
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 203*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of gaming set, [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md)
- **Equipment.** A [crowbar](/compendium/items/crowbar.md), a set of dark [common clothes](/compendium/items/common-clothes.md) including a hood, and a belt [pouch](/compendium/items/pouch.md) containing 15 gp

Little is known about the Augen Trust, even within the court of the Dwendalian Empire. Only one person knows all the members of this elite network of imperial spies: its leader, Oliver Schreiber, a noble gnome with the ear of King Dwendal.

If you were favored with membership in the Augen Trust, your entire life was laid bare before the secret spymaster at one point, and you were found to be a loyal servant of the empire with a particular set of skills. Betraying the Trust is high treason against the crown, and defectors are hunted down and quickly slain.

Most defectors from the Augen Trust flee to the Biting North, beyond the reach of the empire. The Clovis Concord would extradite traitors in a heartbeat to maintain diplomatic relations with the empire, and fleeing to Xhorhas is tantamount to suicide in the present political climate.

If you are a member of the Trust going on adventures, you are either a traitor who has somehow managed to keep your true identity secret from the greatest spies in the empire—or you are still on active duty. In the latter case, you can work with your DM to figure out why you are traveling with outside adventurers.

## Feature: Spy Contact

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other spies. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.

## Specialty

There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves' guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.

## Suggested Characteristics

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I always have a plan for when things go wrong. |
| 2 | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me. |
| 3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden. |
| 4 | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy. |
| 5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide. |
| 6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds. |
| 7 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it. |
| 8 | I blow up at the slightest insult. |

| 3 | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good) |
| 4 | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil) |
| 5 | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) |
| 6 | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good) |

| 6 | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that. |
