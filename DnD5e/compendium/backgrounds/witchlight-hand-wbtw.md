# Witchlight Hand
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 11*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance), [Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)
- **Tool Proficiencies.** [Disguise kit](/compendium/items/disguise-kit.md) or one type of musical Instrument
- **Languages.** One of your choice
- **Equipment.** A [disguise kit](/compendium/items/disguise-kit.md) or a musical instrument of your choice, a deck of cards, a carnival uniform or [costume](/compendium/items/costume-clothes.md), one trinket (determined by rolling on the [Feywild Trinkets](/compendium/items/feywild-trinket-wbtw.md)), and a [pouch](/compendium/items/pouch.md) containing 8 gp

You crept into the Witchlight Carnival as a child or youth and never looked back, earning a place among those who work behind the scenes to keep the carnival in business. As a hand, you work hard and party hard. The carnival has borne you to many fantastic worlds, circling back around to your home world once every eight years, but you know almost nothing about these worlds because you spend all your time in the carnival. You know the other hands well, but the carnival's owners—Mister Witch and Mister Light—remain mysterious to you even after all these years.

Maybe you joined the carnival to escape a dismal life at home, or maybe you were enchanted by the idea of visiting new places or the dream of becoming one of the carnival's star attractions. Now that you're older, carnival life has lost some of its appeal. The daily routine has grown tedious, the cyclical nature of the carnival's journey monotonous. The carnival no longer fills your heart with a sense of wonder. Perhaps greater adventures await you beyond the carnival's gates.

## Feature: Carnival Fixture

The Witchlight Carnival provides you with free, modest lodging and food. In addition, you may wander about the carnival and partake of its many wonders at no cost to you, provided you don't disrupt its shows or cause any other trouble.

## Carnival Companion

Over the years, you have earned the friendship of another carnival fixture. Roll a d8 and consult the Carnival Companion table to determine whom or what you've befriended, or you can choose an option that you like. Work with your DM to flesh out this friendship. This companion hangs around you while you're in the carnival, but it won't voluntarily leave the carnival.

The DM can use the [Witchlight hand](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/witchlight-hand-medium-wbtw.md) stat block in chapter 1 to represent hands, performers, and animal trainers who serve as carnival companions. Statistics for the other companions appear in the "Monster Manual".

**Carnival Companion**

|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Old, cantankerous Witchlight hand |
| 2 | Young, impressionable Witchlight hand |
| 3 | Performer (such as an acrobat, a clown, or a musician) |
| 4 | Retired performer |

| 6 | Old [blink dog](/compendium/bestiary/fey/blink-dog.md) |
| 7 | Cheery [sprite](/compendium/bestiary/fey/sprite.md) |
| 8 | Harmless, magical wisp of light (no stat block required) that has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet |

## Character Traits

As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters' personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the "Player's Handbook", or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn't make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table.

These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background.

**Personality Traits**
