# Running the Adventure
![[000-rta-01.png|right|300]]

This book is written for the Dungeon Master. It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature that appears in the adventure. It also teaches you how to run a D&D game.

The other book that accompanies this one (called "*the rulebook*") contains the information the players need to create and advance their characters (the adventurers and heroes of the story), as well as the rules you need to adjudicate situations that arise during the adventure.

## Overview
A D&D adventure is a collection of locations, quests, and challenges that inspires you to tell a story. The outcome of that story is determined by the actions and decisions of the adventurers—and, of course, the luck of the dice. You can run *Dragon of Icespire Peak* for as few as one player or as many as five players. Each player starts with a 1st-level character.

The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the North—a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by lawless, untamed wilderness. You don't need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure, as everything you need to know about the setting is contained in this book.

If this is your first time running a D&D adventure, read the "Role of the Dungeon Master" section.

### Role of the Dungeon Master
The Dungeon Master (also called "the DM") has a special role in the D&D game.

The DM is a **referee**. When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.

The DM is a **storyteller**. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters that the players must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters' actions.

The DM is a **roleplayer**. The DM plays the monsters and villains in the adventure, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays the parts of all the other characters who the adventurers meet, including helpful ones.

The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you and the players have fun. The rules aren't in charge. You're the DM—you're in charge of the game.

#### Choosing a Dungeon Master
Who should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a group together and start up a game often ends up being the DM by default, but that doesn't have to be the case.

#### DM Tips
As the DM, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the game. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they arise.

**When in doubt, make it up**. It's better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.

**Embrace the shared story**. D&D is about telling a story as a group, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the words and deeds of their characters. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.

**It's not a competition**. The DM isn't competing against the player characters. Your job is to referee the rules, run monsters, and keep the story moving.

**Be consistent and fair**. If you decide that a rule works a certain way, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play. Treat the rules and your players in a fair, impartial manner.

**Modify the adventure to suit your tastes**. The adventure has no prescribed outcome. You can alter any encounter to make it more interesting and fun for your particular group of players.

**Keep a notepad and some graph paper handy**. Use the notepad to keep track of details such as the characters' marching order. Graph paper will be helpful if you need to draw a quick map for your players.

#### Improvising Ability Checks
The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation, and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes characters try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. You decide whether their attempts are successful.

Ability checks only come into play if there's a genuine chance of succeeding or failing at the task. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask for an ability check. Just tell the player what happens. Conversely, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.

If and when you decide that an ability check is required, ask yourself these questions:

***What Kind of Ability Check.*** Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use.

***How Hard Is It.*** Decide whether the task's difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use the appropriate DC.

**DC 10 (Easy**). An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.

**DC 15 (Moderate**). A moderate task requires a higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.

**DC 20 (Hard**). Hard tasks include things beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability. Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck—or a lot of specialized training—to pull off a hard task.

### Other Components
The box containing this adventure includes components designed to help you as the Dungeon Master. In addition to the rulebook, these components are as follows:

#### DM Screen
The inside of the folding screen has information that can help you while running the adventure. You can also use the screen to hide your notes and die rolls, thus keeping the players in suspense.

#### Poster Map
When you're ready to begin the adventure, unfold the poster map so that the map of Phandalin faces up. Here is where the adventure begins. When it comes time for players to embark on quests, use the Sword Coast map on the reverse side to help chart their overland journey.

#### Cards
The box contains the following cards:

**Combat Step by Step Cards**. These identical cards outline the order of combat, as described in the rulebook.

**Condition Cards**. These cards describe various conditions that can affect creatures in the game. A player whose character is suffering from a condition can keep the card as a reminder, giving it back to you when the condition ends for that character.

**Initiative Cards**. After the characters and each group of monsters involved in a combat roll initiative, distribute these cards among the combat participants, from the highest to lowest initiative count. For example, whoever rolls the highest initiative gets the "1" card and acts first, whoever rolls the second highest initiative gets the "2" card, and so on. Keep the numbered cards for the creatures you're running.

**Magic Charm Card**. This card describes a special charm (see "Charm of the Storm." You become charged with the power of the storm, to the extent that tiny sparks crackle in your eyes. You can cast the *lightning bolt* spell (3rd-level version) as an action. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.). Give the card to the player whose character receives the charm. Collect the card when the charm ends for that character.

**Magic Item Cards**. When the characters acquire a magic item and identify it, give the players the card for that item. Let the player whose character has the item keep the card for reference until the item is expended or no longer in that character's possession.

**Quest Cards**. When a new quest becomes available to the characters, give that quest's card to the players. Collect the card if the characters complete the quest or decide they don't want to complete it.

**Sidekick Cards**. If you're running the game for a single player, give the player these cards and let them choose a sidekick. The sidekick's corresponding stat block can be found in the rulebook. If the sidekick dies, collect the card; the player can't choose that sidekick again.

> ##### Adventure Maps
>Maps that appear in this book are for the DM's eyes only. A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren't meant to see—hence the need for secrecy.
>
>When the characters arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a piece of graph paper, copying what's on your map while omitting details as appropriate. It's not important that your hand-drawn map perfectly match what's in the printed adventure. Focus on getting the shape and dimensions correct, and leave the rest to the players' imaginations.

## The Forgotten Realms
The world of the Forgotten Realms is one of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk. In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Bards sing of kings, queens, heroes, and tyrants who died long ago.

On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Fell magic and deadly monsters are the perils one faces when traveling in the Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.

### Map of the Sword Coast
The map below shows a region of the Forgotten Realms called the Sword Coast. This is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms. Amid a lawless wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, bitter winds, and roaming monsters, the coast holds such great bastions of civilization as the city of Neverwinter, in the shadow of the fuming volcano known as Mount Hotenow.

This map is for the DM's eyes only, as it indicates the locations of places described later in this adventure. A larger, player-friendly version of the map appears on one side of the poster map included with this adventure. The poster map of the Sword Coast can be shared freely with the players as their characters explore the region.

Geographical locations marked on both the DM's map and the players' map are described below in alphabetical order. This information is not secret, and can be shared with players if they request details about a particular location.

![[002-map-sword-coast-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### Conyberry
The Triboar Trail runs right through this abandoned town, which was sacked by barbarians years ago and now lies in ruins. A dirt road extending south of the town leads to a supposedly abandoned shrine dedicated to Savras (god of divination and fate). For more information on this location, see "*Shrine of Savras*."

#### Crags
These rocky, windswept hills are dotted with old mines that have become infested with monsters.

#### High Road
This highway hugs the coast, connecting Neverwinter to the coastal cities of Luskan to the north and Waterdeep to the south. For years, the stretch of road south of Neverwinter fell into disuse because of frequent monster attacks. Of late, efforts have been made to keep the road safe, with light patrols of guards on horseback moving between Neverwinter and Leilon.

#### Kryptgarden Forest
This ancient forest tucked behind the Sword Mountains contains the ruins of bygone dwarven civilizations.

#### Leilon
This small town along the High Road is in the midst of rebuilding itself after being abandoned for years. Its inhabitants hail from Neverwinter and are in the paid service of the city's Lord Protector, who has tasked them with turning Leilon into a fortified settlement that can ward off threats from the Mere of Dead Men.

#### Mere of Dead Men
Travelers on the High Road, which skirts the mere to the east, must resist being lured into this cold and desolate swamp by bobbing **will-o'-wisps**. Countless adventurers have perished in the mere, drawn by tales of ruined castles half-sunk in the mire.

#### Neverwinter
This city was badly damaged when Mount Hotenow erupted some fifty years ago. Now, the City of Skilled Hands works to rebuild under the watchful eye of its Lord Protector, Dagult Neverember, who rules in the absence of an heir to Neverwinter's crown. At present, no legitimate heirs to the old Alagondar royal line are known to exist, and many believe that the line is ended. Lord Neverember, taking no chances, quietly pays off or disposes of anyone claiming a connection to the rulers of old.

#### Neverwinter Wood
The forest east of Neverwinter seems to have a magical quality about it, or at least an air of mystical secrecy. Reclusive spellcasters are rumored to dwell deep within.

#### Phandalin
This nondescript mining settlement, nestled in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, serves as the starting location for the adventure. For more information, see "Welcome to Phandalin."

#### Starmetal Hills
This range of rocky knolls is so named because the area has been the impact site of a number of meteor showers over millennia. The hills are haunted by ruthless barbarian tribes, giving others little reason to visit the area.

#### Sword Mountains
These steep, craggy, snow-capped mountains are home to scattered tribes of orcs as well as other monsters. Icespire Peak is the tallest among them. Their foothills are strewn with the ruins of bygone kingdoms, and more than a few half-forgotten dungeons and tombs.

#### Triboar Trail
This path south of Neverwinter Wood is the safest route between Neverwinter and the town of Triboar, located in the Dessarin Valley to the east (off the map). The trail is not patrolled, and monster attacks are commonplace.

## First Session: Character Creation
Dungeons & Dragons is a game that requires several hours to play, but you can stop the game at any time and continue it later. The first session should focus on character creation—one of the most fun aspects of the game. If the players create and equip their characters with time to spare, you can begin the adventure once they're ready to go. Otherwise, congratulate them on building their characters and begin the adventure with the next session.

During character creation, your role as the DM is to let your players build the characters they want, and to help them come up with explanations for how their characters came together to form an adventuring party. If you have only one player, work with that player to come up with their character's backstory, then let the player decide if they want the character to have a sidekick (see "Running for One Player" below).

### Character Options
Each player has options when it comes to choosing a character race, class, and background. These options are summarized in the Character Options table. If there are multiple players in the group, encourage them to choose different classes so that the party has a range of abilities. It's less important that the party include multiple races or backgrounds, as sometimes it's fun to play an all-dwarf party or a troupe of adventuring entertainers.

##### Character Options
| Races | Classes | Backgrounds |
| Dwarf | Bard | Acolyte |
| Elf | Cleric | Criminal |
| Halfling | Fighter | Entertainer |
| Human | Rogue | Sage |
|  | Wizard | Soldier |

While your players follow the steps of character creation as outlined in the rulebook, pay attention to the choices they make. The backgrounds they choose define who their characters were before becoming adventurers, and also include roleplaying hooks in the form of ideals, bonds, and flaws—things that you, as the DM, want to know. For example, if a player chooses the Criminal background, one of the options for the character's bond is, "I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor." If that's the character's bond, work with the player to decide who that generous benefactor is.

### Running for Multiple Players
If you have two or more players, the easiest way to start the adventure is to assume that the characters know each other and have some sort of history together, however brief that history might be. The characters might have met in Neverwinter and traveled to Phandalin together, or they might have arrived in Phandalin separately and gotten to know each other while staying at the local inn.

#### Questions to Ask
Here are some questions you can ask the players as they create characters:

- Are any of the characters related to each other?
- What keeps the characters together as a party?
- What does each character like most about every other member of the adventuring party?

### Running for One Player
If you're running this adventure for a single player, you can give that player a sidekick as a secondary character. Let the player choose one of the pregenerated sidekicks from the selection of Sidekick Cards. Rules and stat blocks for sidekicks appear in the rulebook. You might need to help the player run the sidekick for the first few sessions. If a sidekick is lost or no longer needed, the character can return to Phandalin and acquire a new one.

#### Using Sidekicks
Make sure the player understands the roles and limitations of sidekicks in this adventure:

- Sidekicks are stalwart companions who can perform tasks both in and out of combat, including things such as setting up camp and carrying gear.
- Ideally, a sidekick's abilities should complement those of the main character. For example, a spellcaster makes a good sidekick for a fighter or rogue.

### Reading Ahead
As the players familiarize themselves with the character options and adventuring gear described in the rulebook, take advantage of the opportunity to read ahead.

"The Adventure Begins" section tells you everything you need to know about what's happening in and around Phandalin. It also describes quests that characters can pursue, leading them to other locations. The adventure is built around these quests. Hopefully, the characters will find them tempting enough to undertake.

> ##### Glossary
>The adventure uses terms that might be unfamiliar to you. A few of these terms are described here. For descriptions of rules-specific terms, see *the rulebook*.
>
>***Characters.*** This term refers to the adventurers run by the players. They are the protagonists in any D&D adventure. A group of characters or adventurers is called a party.

>***Nonplayer Characters (NPCs).*** This term refers to characters run by the DM. How an NPC behaves is dictated by the adventure and by the DM.

>***Boxed Text.*** At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that's meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to the players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe locations or present bits of scripted dialogue.

>***Stat Block.*** Any monster or NPC that is likely to be involved in combat requires game statistics so that the DM can run it effectively. These statistics are presented in a format called a stat block. You'll find the stat blocks needed for this adventure in the "*Creatures*" section.

>***Tenday.*** In the Forgotten Realms, a week is ten days long and called a tenday. Each month consists of three tendays—thirty days total.

![[003-rta-02.png|right|300]]

## The Adventure Begins
The adventure begins in the mining town of Phandalin. There, the characters receive quests and can choose which ones to pursue.

The "Adventure Background" section describes the events leading up to the adventure and the main threats the characters will face. The "Welcome to Phandalin" and "Exploring Phandalin" sections describe the town where the adventure begins. Knowing Phandalin well will ensure a smooth start.

### Adventure Background
Driven from lands farther north by more powerful dragons, a **young white dragon** named Cryovain has descended upon the Sword Mountains, claiming the snow-capped range as its domain. Typical of its kind, Cryovain is dim-witted and cruel. The dragon patrols the skies around Icespire Peak, surveying its territory while hunting for food and easy treasure. With each passing day, the dragon's domain grows as it ranges farther across the land, preying on anything it can catch with its claws or freeze to death with its icy breath. Sightings of the dragon are becoming more common, as are its attacks.

A crumbling fortress on the northeast spur of Icespire Peak serves as the dragon's lair. Cryovain seized the icy fortress from a tribe of savage **orcs**, killing the orc war chief and forcing the tribe's survivors to flee into the foothills and forests. Enraged by the death of their war chief, the orcs have called upon ancient allies—evil, shapechanging, half-orc spellcasters who bless and advise them. These half-orcs worship Talos, an evil god of storms, and many dwell in the dark depths of Neverwinter Wood. In stormy weather, they gather on remote hilltops to summon **Gorthok the Thunder Boar**, a primal entity that serves Talos. Like the god it serves, Gorthok delights in destruction.

The orcs aren't the only creatures thrown into upheaval by Cryovain's sudden arrival. A **manticore** driven from its mountaintop nest by the roaming white dragon has migrated to the foothills and begun terrorizing folk living on the outskirts of the mining town of Phandalin. Other monsters in the region have been similarly displaced.

### Welcome to Phandalin
The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with neighboring dwarves and gnomes. Then an orc horde swept through the area and laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.

In the last three or four years, settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. The new settlement is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. The arrival of a white dragon threatens to destroy all that they've worked to rebuild.

When you are ready for the adventure to get underway, show the poster map of Phandalin to the players and read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Nestled in the rocky foothills of the snow-capped Sword Mountains is the mining town of Phandalin, which consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings. Crumbling stone ruins surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past.
>>
>>Phandalin's residents are quiet, hard-working folk who came from distant cities to eke out a life amid the harsh wilderness. They are farmers, stonecutters, blacksmiths, traders, prospectors, and children. The town has no walls and no garrison, but most of the adults keep weapons within easy reach in case the need for arms should arise.
>>
>>Visitors are welcome here, particularly if they have coin to spend or news to share. The Stonehill Inn at the center of town offers modest lodging and meals. A couple of doors down from the inn, posted outside the townmaster's hall, is a job board for adventurers.
>>

When the adventurers are ready to inspect the job board, proceed to the "Townmaster's Hall" section.

### Exploring Phandalin
The characters might wish to explore key establishments within Phandalin. These locations are marked on the map of Phandalin and the corresponding poster map.

![[005-map-phandalin-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### Stonehill Inn
This modest, two-story roadhouse has six rooms for rent on the upper floor. A bed for the night costs 5 sp, while a meal costs 1 sp. The proprietor is a short, friendly male human named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. If the characters talk to Toblen, he shares a brief tale told to him by one of his regular patrons. Roll a d6 and consult the Phandalin Tales table to determine which tale Toblen knows, or pick a tale the characters haven't heard yet.

#### Barthen's Provisions
The shelves of this general store stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. Barthen's doesn't stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. (For prices, see *the rulebook*.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster. Those looking to buy *potions of healing* are urged to visit Adabra Gwynn at *Umbrage Hill* (see the "Potions of Healing" sidebar).

The proprietor, Elmar Barthen, is a lean and balding human man of fifty years. He employs a couple of young clerks (Ander and Thistle) who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Barthen isn't around. Characters who engage Barthen, Ander, or Thistle in friendly conversation are told a tale. Roll a d6 and consult the Phandalin Tales table, or pick a tale the characters haven't heard yet.

#### Lionshield Coster

>>Hanging above the front door of this modest trading post is a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted on it.
>>

This building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar over a hundred miles to the east. The company ships finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region.

The master of the Phandalin post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named Linene Graywind. Linene keeps a supply of *armor* and *weapons*, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. (For prices, see *the rulebook*.) Linene won't sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town. If the characters talk to her, she recalls a tale told to her by one of her neighbors. Roll a d6 and consult the Phandalin Tales table, or pick a tale the characters haven't heard yet.

#### Phandalin Miner's Exchange
Miners come here to have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. The exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. Enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.

The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is a calculating human woman named Halia Thornton. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a shadowy organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and she can become a valuable patron to adventurers who don't cross her. If the characters get on her good side, Halia tells them a tale. Roll a d6 and consult the Phandalin Tales table, or pick a tale the characters haven't heard yet.

#### Shrine of Luck
Phandalin's only temple is a shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora (goddess of luck and good fortune) and is normally in the care of a zealous elf acolyte named Sister Garaele. However, she is out of town for the duration of this adventure.

Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin, and is currently in Neverwinter doing exactly that. In her absence, the shrine is left untended.

##### Phandalin Tales
| d6 | Tale |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | "Once again, the orcs have come down from the mountains to prey on the lowlands! If Neverwinter doesn't send help soon, the orcs will overrun Phandalin and destroy everything we've worked so hard to rebuild." |
| 2 | "As the Triboar Trail runs east, it passes through the ruins of Conyberry, a town sacked by barbarians years ago. There's a ruined temple south of Conyberry where it's said the locals hid their gold." (If the characters visit the temple, see "*Shrine of Savras*" on page 38.) |
| 3 | "Strange magic pervades Neverwinter Wood, confounding navigators and obscuring the ancient ruins of bygone kingdoms lost in its depths." |
| 4 | "Falcon's Hunting Lodge is the only safe haven in Neverwinter Wood. It lies deep in the forest along a river's edge, and wealthy nobles venture there to hunt while under Falcon's protection. Falcon is a retired veteran of many wars, and it's said he'll offer free room and board to anyone who brings him a bottle of wine." (If the characters pay Falcon a visit, see "*Falcon's Hunting Lodge*" on page 24.) |
| 5 | "West of Phandalin, on the coast, is an old stone lighthouse. Ships are drawn to this gleaming tower like moths to a flame, and are doomed to crash upon its rocks. Their wrecks must be filled with treasure!" (If the characters visit the lighthouse, see "*Tower of Storms*" on page 40.) |
| 6 | "Some folk claim to have seen a dragon flying through the high clouds. At that distance, it's hard to gauge the creature's size, but some say it's as big as an elephant and has gleaming white scales." |

#### Townmaster's Hall

>>The townmaster's hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. The job board next to the front door features a sparse number of notices, all written in Common and in the same hand.
>>

If the characters inspect the notices on the job board, proceed to the "Phandalin Quests" section.

> ##### Potions of Healing
>No place in Phandalin sells *potions of healing*. However, characters who wish to purchase one or more such potions can do so at the Umbrage Hill windmill, located a few miles south of Phandalin. The windmill is home to a midwife and acolyte of Chauntea (goddess of agriculture) named Adabra Gwynn. For more information on this location, see "*Umbrage Hill*".
>

### Phandalin Quests
The job board outside the townmaster's hall is where adventurers can learn about quests. Each quest is printed on a card, which you can give to the players when that quest becomes available (see "Starting Quests" and "Follow-Up Quests" below). Let the players choose which quest to complete first, second, third, and so on. If the players don't like a particular quest, they are under no obligation to complete it. However, completing quests helps the characters become more powerful (see "Leveling Up").

#### Harbin Wester, Quest Giver
All the notices on the job board are written by Harbin Wester, Phandalin's duly appointed townmaster. Harbin is a pompous, middle-aged banker who lives in a house east of the townmaster's hall. Reports of a white dragon in the area have turned him into a veritable shut-in, and he rarely goes outside except to get food and post new notices calling for adventurers.

Characters who knock on Harbin's door hear his voice on the other side say, "If you're a dragon, know that I'm far too thin and bony to make a good meal!" No matter what the adventurers do to allay his fears, Harbin refuses to open the door, preferring to talk through it. Other residents who trouble Harbin with complaints receive similar treatment.

If the characters ask him about a quest, Harbin sets them on the right track, offering payment upon their return. When the time comes to pay up, he slips the payment under the door one gold coin at a time.

> ##### Adventure Locations and Encounters
>This adventure encourages characters to explore locations marked on the DM's map of the Sword Coast. When the characters embark on a journey to a location, flip to the section of this book that describes that location in detail. For example, if the players choose to undertake the Umbrage Hill Quest, go to the "*Umbrage Hill*" section. Each location includes an overview that briefly describes what characters can expect to find there. This overview is followed by information you'll need to run the encounters at that location.
>
>***Running Encounters.*** This adventure describes what the characters see when they first arrive at a location, and what they'll discover as they explore it. The adventure also tells you how the location's inhabitants react to the characters' arrival.

>No encounter has a predetermined outcome. For example, characters who explore *Umbrage Hill* are likely to encounter a **manticore**. Although fighting the monster is always an option, characters might decide to negotiate with the manticore instead. Be flexible, particularly when dealing with intelligent monsters. If every encounter becomes a fight to the death, your players might get bored and miss out on some fun roleplaying opportunities. Whenever possible, reward players for being clever. For example, characters who disturb the ankhegs at the *Loggers' Camp* might be able to escape from the burrowing monsters by jumping in the nearby river. Similarly, characters who are willing to negotiate with the wererats in the *Mountain's Toe Gold Mine* might be able to forge a truce between the wererats and the miners, ending their conflict so that the mine can be reopened.

#### Starting Quests
When the characters first visit the job board, there are three quests posted. Give the players the cards for these quests so that they can choose which to pursue.

![[006-rta-03.png|right|300]]

**Dwarven Excavation Quest**. "Dwarf prospectors found ancient dwarven ruins in the mountains southwest of here, and have been working an archaeological dig seeking treasure and relics. They need to be warned that a white dragon has moved into the area. Take the warning to them, then return to Townmaster Harbin Wester to collect a reward of 50 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, see "*Dwarven Excavation*."

**Gnomengarde Quest**. "A clan of reclusive rock gnomes resides in a small network of caves in the mountains to the southeast. The gnomes of Gnomengarde are known for their magical inventions, and they might have something with which to defeat the dragon. Get whatever you can from them. If you bring back something useful and don't want to keep it for yourselves, Townmaster Harbin Wester will pay you 50 gp for it." If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with "*Gnomengarde*."

**Umbrage Hill Quest**. "The local midwife—an acolyte of Chauntea named Adabra Gwynn—lives by herself in a stone windmill on the side of a hill a few miles south of Phandalin. With dragon sightings becoming more common, it's not safe for her to be alone. Urge Adabra to return to Phandalin. Once she's safe, visit Townmaster Harbin Wester to claim a reward of 25 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with "*Umbrage Hill*."

#### Follow-Up Quests
After the characters complete two starting quests, the following three quests are added to the job board:

**Butterskull Ranch Quest**. "Orcs have attacked Butterskull Ranch, five miles east of Conyberry along the Triboar Trail! Travel there with haste, assess the damage, and help any way you can. Ranch owner Alfonse "Big Al" Kalazorn is a retired sheriff who can reward you for your efforts. If he's dead, return to Townmaster Harbin Wester with proof of Kalazorn's demise to receive a reward of 100 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with "*Butterskull Ranch*."

**Loggers' Camp Quest**. "Deep in Neverwinter Wood, along the river that flows west toward Neverwinter, is a logging camp. Every two months, Phandalin delivers fresh supplies to the camp, which is run by the half-brother of Phandalin's townmaster, Harbin Wester. Barthen, the local provisioner, has prepared a new delivery. He needs someone to bear the supplies safely to the camp. Return to Harbin Wester with a notice of delivery signed by his half-brother, Tibor Wester, to claim your reward of 100 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with "*Loggers' Camp*."

**Mountain's Toe Quest**. "The Mountain's Toe Gold Mine lies fifteen miles northeast of Phandalin. The new overseer, **Don-Jon Raskin**, just made the trip from Neverwinter to Phandalin and needs to be escorted to the mine. There's no telling what dangers lie between here and there. Once you deliver Raskin safe and sound, return to Townmaster Harbin Wester to collect a reward of 100 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with "*Mountain's Toe Gold Mine*."

After the characters complete two follow-up quests, another three follow-up quests are added to the job board:

**Axeholm Quest**. "Within a mountain fifteen miles south of Phandalin stands the ancient dwarven fortress of Axeholm, which has been sealed for years. If a dragon attack is imminent, the people of Phandalin might need to evacuate and take refuge in Axeholm. To that end, someone needs to open the fortress and make it safe for habitation. Once you accomplish these tasks, return to Townmaster Wester to collect a reward of 250 gp." If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with "*Axeholm*."

**Dragon Barrow Quest**. "The dragon that besets us is not the first to threaten this region. Between here and Neverwinter lies the barrow mound of a warrior whose magical dragon-slaying sword helped fell a green dragon terrorizing the High Road a century ago. Rumor has it the *dragon slayer* sword is buried there too. Retrieve it, and let the sword be its own reward!" If the characters undertake this quest, proceed with "*Dragon Barrow*."

**Woodland Manse Quest**. "The orcs have fallen under the sway of evil spellcasters in Neverwinter Wood, and have been sighted in growing numbers near Falcon's Hunting Lodge. The spellcasters dwell in a ruined manse. Falcon needs someone to make a preemptive strike against it. Destroy the evil in the manse, then expect him to reward you." If the characters undertake this quest, run "*Falcon's Hunting Lodge*" followed by "*Woodland Manse*."

### Leveling Up
Characters advance in level by completing quests, using the guidelines for leveling up in the rulebook. Regardless of the number of characters in the party, the rate of advancement is as follows:

- Characters gain a level each time they complete a starting quest, until they reach 3rd level. Once they are 3rd level or higher, completing a starting quest has no effect on their level.
- Characters gain a level each time they complete two follow-up quests.
- Characters gain a level if they slay Cryovain the white dragon.

### Where's the White Dragon?
Cryovain the **young white dragon** is a roaming threat that can be encountered almost anywhere. Each time the characters arrive at a location tagged on the map of the Sword Coast or prepare to leave that location, roll a d20 and consult the Dragon's Location table to determine Cryovain's current whereabouts. Make your first roll on the table when the adventurers leave Phandalin for the first time.

When the dragon visits a location that is not its lair, it surveys the location from the sky, beyond the reach of ranged weapon attacks. If it spots nothing it can eat, it flies off after circling the location for a minute or two. If it spots something tasty, such as a mule, a horse, or a character, the dragon swoops down and attacks it. Once the dragon kills something, it grabs the carcass and flies off with it. Whatever it takes is then eaten within the hour.

If Cryovain loses more than 10 hit points in battle, the dragon disengages from combat and retreats to its lair at Icespire Hold, remaining there until it finishes a long rest and regains all its hit points. Only at Icespire Hold does the dragon fight to the death.

# Axeholm
"Axeholm" is balanced for characters of 5th level, though characters of 3rd or 4th level can survive its perils if they are cautious and rest between encounters.

## Location Overview
Axeholm is a dwarven fortress carved into the base of a mountain fifteen miles south of Phandalin. The site was abandoned and sealed up long years ago after being haunted by a banshee—the restless spirit of a moon elf ambassador named Vyldara who tried and failed to foment civil unrest among the dwarves. The dwarves imprisoned the elf and sent messages to her people, asking that they come to collect her. Before envoys could be sent, Vyldara killed two guards trying to escape, only to be cut down by dwarven axes before she could succeed.

When the elf's evil spirit started filling Axeholm's halls with deathly wails, the dwarves abandoned their stronghold, but not before several dwarves slain by the banshee arose as ghouls to feed on their kin. Ghouls and other creatures now prowl Axeholm, while the banshee continues to haunt the fortress's upper halls. The banshee senses the arrival of adventurers with its Detect Life trait. In its twisted spectral mind, they are invaders who must be destroyed for their trespass.

### Quest Goals
To complete the Axeholm Quest, adventurers must kill or drive out all the monsters in the fortress.

> ##### Axeholm Features
>In the dwarves' absence, Axeholm has become a dark, sullen tomb, full of dust and bad memories. It's quiet most of the time, except when the sorrowful wails of the banshee fill the place. The following features are common throughout.
>
>***Arrow Slits.*** When using an arrow slit for protection, a creature gains three-quarters cover (see *the rulebook*) against outside threats. A Medium character can't squeeze through an arrow slit, but a Small character can with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

>***Ballistas.*** For its defense, Axeholm relied heavily on ballistas—massive crossbows that fire heavy bolts. A crew of three dwarves operated each ballista. Before it can be fired, a ballista must be loaded and aimed. It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. *Hit*: 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

>***Ceilings.*** Ceilings throughout are fifteen feet high and flat, unless the text says otherwise.

>***Chimneys.*** Fireplaces throughout Axeholm have chimneys cut from seamless stone. Some of those chimneys can be used to gain access to the fortress.

>***Doors.*** Regular doors are made of thick, sturdy oak reinforced with iron bands and fitted with iron hinges and handles.

>***Light.*** The walls are lined with torch sconces, but the torches burned down long ago. Adventurers require darkvision or their own light sources to see inside.

>***Stench.*** A foul stench lingers in Axeholm, becoming stronger as one gets closer to the resident ghouls.

## Travel to Axeholm
The day-long journey to Axeholm from Phandalin takes the characters across grassy lowlands that skirt the rocky foothills of the Sword Mountains. The trek passes without incident, though cool winds and rain blowing in from the Sword Coast make the trip far from pleasant.

## Arrival
When the adventurers arrive at Axeholm, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Thrust out from the base of a dark gray mountain is the entrance to the dwarven fortress—a dark, fifteen-foot-wide passageway flanked by forty-foot-high bulwarks of smooth, seamless stone. An iron portcullis covered with rust blocks the entrance. Arrow slits carved into the bulwarks are dark, revealing no hint of occupation.
>>

Entering the fortress is the characters' first challenge. The portcullis in area A1 is too heavy to lift, and its bars are too narrowly spaced for even Small characters to squeeze through. However, a Small character can squeeze through an arrow slit into area A2 or area A3, then attempt to raise the portcullis using the winches there. The winches are rusty and require a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to turn. Each successful check allows the portcullis to be raised 5 feet.

Characters who search for another entrance can attempt DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) checks. A successful check spots numerous stone chimneys protruding from the mountainside, but an earthquake after Axeholm was abandoned closed off most of those to anything but Tiny creatures. Only the chimneys leading down to area A21 and area A23 can be accessed by the adventurers. Scaling the mountain requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, as there are plenty of handholds and footholds.

Crawling down a chimney to area A21 or area A23 requires another successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If this check fails, the character falls 20 feet to the bottom of the chimney, landing in the sooty hearth and taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Characters who use climbing gear to scale the mountain and lower themselves down a chimney have advantage on their checks. See *the rulebook* for more information on *advantage*.

### Keyed Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of Axeholm.

![[008-map-axeholm-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### A1. Outer Gauntlet
Axeholm's primary entrance and exit is this defensible passage, which is blocked by a sturdy portcullis (see "Arrival" above). Arrow slits are spaced along the walls and murder holes line the ceiling, enabling fortress defenders to shoot ballistas at invaders or pour boiling oil on top of them. With the dwarves gone, the only remaining defenses are the portcullis and the double doors to the south, which are barred shut.

Characters hoping to get through the double doors must break them down, which takes a single character 1 hour. Multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. The noise created by smashing down the doors is loud enough to alert all the dwarf **ghouls** in the fortress, which gather in area A4 and attack once the doors fall. The fortress contains three dwarf ghouls plus three additional ghouls for each character in the party, not including sidekicks. If these ghouls are killed here, the characters encounter no more of them in the fortress.

#### A2. Western Bulwark
This area contains seven ballistas pointed at arrow slits, a winch that raises and lowers the portcullis, and a stone staircase leading up to area A22. Each ballista is equipped with five bolts.

#### A3. Eastern Bulwark
This area has the same features as area A2.

#### A4. Mustering Hall
This great hall has a 40-foot-high ceiling supported by four thick stone pillars. A thick layer of dust covers the flagstone floor. In the middle of each wall past the entrance is a double door. Arrow slits are set high up in the north and south walls, and a small stone balcony protrudes from the wall above the east exit, 20 feet above the floor. (See areas A22, area A24, and area A25 for details of these features.)

#### A5. West Hall
The floor is strewn with bits of armor and the gnawed bones of dwarves who were killed and eaten by ghouls. Lurking in the hall is one **ghoul** for each member of the party, not including sidekicks. The ghouls pursue prey that flees.

#### A6. Armory
The dwarves took all the weapons and armor from this area when they left. All that remains are empty stone weapon racks, wooden mannequins upon which armor once hung, and iron hooks in the walls that once bore shields.

#### A7. Main Barracks
Dozens of meager cots lie scattered about the floor. A pair of fireplaces stand cold and dark, their rubble-choked chimneys rising 120 feet through the mountain.

#### A8. Privies
Tattered wool curtains conceal three neglected privies, each with a wooden bench set against the back wall.

#### A9. Stirge in the Smithy
Standing before two blackened hearths are a pair of rusty anvils, which dwarves once used to fashion and repair their armor and weapons.

A fluttering noise can be heard coming from the southernmost fireplace, indicating the presence of a **stirge** near the bottom of the 200-foot-high chimney. If anyone shines a light up there, the stirge panics, flies out, and attacks the nearest character or sidekick. It ignores the characters otherwise.

#### A10. Tool Storage
Dwarven armorsmiths and weaponsmiths stored their tools here, which still hang from hooks along the walls. Though a bit rusty, the tools are in serviceable shape if the characters wish to use them.

#### A11. Inner Gauntlet
Four arrow slits line the walls of this corridor leading to Axeholm's throne room (area A14).

#### A12. West Guard Post
Two ballistas point toward arrow slits in the east wall. Each ballista is equipped with five bolts. The guard post is otherwise empty.

#### A13. East Guard Post
The gnawed bones, torn armor fragments, and rusty battleaxes of two dead dwarf guards lie in the middle of the room. The guards were trapped here by ghouls, killed, and eaten.

Two ballistas aimed at arrow slits in the west wall come equipped with five bolts apiece.

#### A14. Throne Room
Read the following boxed text out loud to describe this area:

>>The stench of death hangs heavy in the air of this dusty, pillared hall, which has a dark, soot-stained fireplace at the east end. A deep alcove in the south wall contains a dais, atop which rests a limestone throne flanked by granite statues of dwarf warriors. Between the throne and the fireplace is a hallway with stairs leading up.
>>

Hiding behind the throne is a **ghoul** with 40 hit points. This undead creature is all that remains of Axeholm's dwarf castellan, who stayed behind to seal up the fortress after most of the garrison fled. The ghoul is the source of the hall's foul stench, which gets stronger closer to the throne. The hidden ghoul can be detected with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check.

If any character inspects the throne, the ghoul lets out a shriek and attacks. Its shriek is heard by the **ghouls** in area A26, which crawl down the chimney and clamber out of the fireplace. This group contains two soot-covered ghouls plus one additional ghoul for each member of the party, not including sidekicks. After all other creatures in the hall have taken a first turn in combat, these ghouls join the battle, acting on the same initiative count as the former castellan.

***Treasure.*** The ghoulish castellan wears a gold signet ring that bears the Axeholm crest: a handaxe clutched in a dwarven gauntlet. The signet ring is worth 5 gp and unlocks the chest in area A29.

#### A15. Dining Room
In the middle of this room, a carved stone dining table (15 feet long by 5 feet wide) is flanked by a pair of equally long wooden benches. Above the table hang two iron chandeliers, their candles long since melted away. North of the seating area is a sooty fireplace and an alcove containing a rough-hewn pit that descends 60 feet.

Abundant handholds and footholds allow a character to climb up or down the pit with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. The bottom of the pit contains moldy animal bones and other refuse discarded by the dwarves after their meals.

#### A16. Kitchen
The dusty room has all the trappings one expects to find in a dwarven kitchen, including metal dishware, utensils, and drinking mugs. A stone sink is equipped with a faucet which, when turned, spouts hot water channeled from a naturally heated underground spring.

#### A17. East Hall in Ruins
The earthquake that hit Axeholm triggered a ceiling collapse that left this hall in ruins. The eastern half of the hall is strewn with debris and is *difficult terrain* (see *the rulebook*). The stench of death hangs heavy here, becoming stronger as the characters move toward area A19.

#### A18. Empty Room
This 15-foot-square room was cleaned out by the dwarves before they evacuated Axeholm. Only dust remains.

#### A19. Ghoul Den
Characters can reach this area by following the naturally formed tunnel from area A17 or by descending the stone staircase from area A24. The door to the north has been smashed open, and its remains are strewn on the floor.

The stench of death and decay grows stronger as the characters approach this room, and they can hear the hisses and snarls of the **ghouls** that lair here. The room contains one ghoul plus one additional ghoul for each member of the party, not including sidekicks.

After dealing with the ghouls, the characters can inspect the room more closely. Describe it to the players as follows:

>>This chamber was once a shrine, as evidenced by wall carvings that depict dwarves carrying censers and observing religious rites. However, the eastern section of the room has collapsed, filling the area with rubble. Gnawed bones scattered among the debris are the remains of a number of dwarves.
>>

***Treasure.*** Characters who search through the rubble in the eastern portion of the room find two treasures:

- A platinum amulet on a thin but sturdy gold chain. This amulet is a holy symbol of Moradin (the dwarven god of creation) and bears his symbol: a hammer and anvil. Any dwarf character recognizes the symbol immediately, while a non-dwarf recognizes it with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check.
- An unlocked steel coffer weighing 5 pounds. This small box is packed with silt, nestled in which is a *potion of superior healing*. Give the players the *Potion of Superior Healing* card when they find this magic item or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### A20. Narrow Tunnel
Ghouls dug this winding, rubble-strewn tunnel connecting the upper and lower levels of Axeholm. The tunnel is 2 feet wide, 5 feet high, and 60 feet long.

#### A21. East Upper Barracks
The ghouls trashed this room, leaving behind wrecked cots, chairs, tables, and other furnishings. A blackened fireplace is set into the east wall, its chimney rising 20 feet to the outside. Characters can use this chimney to enter or exit the fortress (see "Arrival").

#### A22. Upper Bastion
This large chamber extends over the outer gauntlet of the main entrance (area A1) and contains many former defensive measures. Arrow slits to the north allow outside light to enter, filling the northern half of the room with sunlight or moonlight depending on the time of day or night.

Thick webs are strung between the walls and pillars. Lurking among them are several **giant spiders**—three spiders plus one additional spider for each character in the party, not including sidekicks. The spiders are spread throughout the southern half of the room and move to attack all interlopers.

Other defenses include two fireplaces, which were used to heat cauldrons full of oil that the dwarves poured through narrow slits in the floor. Three empty cauldrons are lined up along one of these slits. Arrow slits along the south wall open up onto area A4, and stone staircases descend to areas A2 and area A3.

#### A23. West Upper Barracks
A fireplace is built into the west wall of this room. Hanging from a hook above its mantelpiece is a nonmagical steel shield bearing the symbol of Axeholm: a dwarven gauntlet clutching a handaxe. Characters can use the fireplace's soot-stained chimney to enter or exit the fortress (see "Arrival").

The room's other furnishings—cots, tables, chairs, and empty footlockers—are intact but covered in dust.

#### A24. Haunted Hall
The **banshee** haunts the east–west stretch of this L-shaped hall. The creature floats in the middle of the hall, outside the door to area A27. Describe it to the players as follows:

>>The luminous, wispy form of a female elf floats in the dusty hallway before you, its face wreathed in a tangle of gossamer hair, its body clad in spectral rags that flutter around it. The apparition's face becomes a mask of rage as it screams, "Get out of my house!"
>>

If the characters flee the banshee's presence of their own accord, it lets them go. If they advance toward the undead, attack it, or attempt to parley, it turns violent.

In the first round of combat, the banshee uses Horrifying Visage. On the second round, it uses Wail. After wailing, it withdraws to area A27, passing through the closed door as though it weren't there. In area A27, the undead makes its final stand.

#### A25. Upper East Hall and Balcony
The earthquake caused part of this empty hall to collapse. A double door in the west wall leads to a small stone balcony overlooking area A4.

#### A26. Ghoul Bath
Several **ghouls** gather here—a total of two ghouls plus one additional ghoul for each member of the party, not including sidekicks. The ghouls enter and leave the room through a 2-foot-diameter hole in the east wall, which breaks into the chimney of area A14.

In the middle of this room stands a carved stone tub filled with gnawed dwarven bones. The tub is equipped with a faucet which, when turned, spouts hot water channeled from a naturally heated underground spring. A stone plug seals the drain in the tub's bottom.

#### A27. Banshee's Bedchamber
This bedroom was set aside for honored guests, but its furnishings have decayed with age and are covered with dust and cobwebs. Vyldara once stayed here, but the elf's possessions were taken during her captivity, leaving nothing of value.

#### A28. Castellan's Bedchamber
A stone-framed bed with a moldy mattress stands in the middle of this room, covered in dust and cobwebs. Set into the south wall is a soot-stained fireplace. **Stirges** nest in the rubble-choked chimney—a total of one per party member (including sidekicks). The stirges attack anyone who pokes around in the fireplace.

***Secret Door.*** The back wall of the fireplace is a secret door. A character who searches the interior of the fireplace and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices dwarven hand prints in the soot on the back wall. Pushing on the secret door causes it to swing open on hidden stone hinges, revealing area A29 beyond.

#### A29. Secret Vault
Against the south wall of this otherwise empty room rests a 80-pound iron chest with clawed feet. Its built-in lock bears a tiny circular indentation instead of a traditional keyhole. Close inspection of the indentation reveals a tiny symbol of a handaxe clutched in a gauntlet. This symbol matches the one on the castellan's signet ring (found in area A14), albeit reversed. If the castellan's signet ring is placed in the indentation, the chest unlocks and remains unlocked until its lid is closed tight. The chest can also be unlocked with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using *thieves' tools*, or by a *knock* spell or similar magic.

***Treasure.*** The chest contains a *dread helm* and a pair of *gauntlets of ogre power*. Give the players the *Dread Helm* and *Gauntlets of Ogre Power* cards when they find and identify these two magic items or they can reference them in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### A30. Privies
Rusty chain mail curtains conceal a pair of privies, each with a wooden bench set against the back wall. The chutes for these privies descend deep into the mountain, passing just east of area A10.

# Butterskull Ranch
"Butterskull Ranch" is balanced for characters of 3rd level, but characters of 2nd level can survive this quest if they avoid combat and focus on rescuing Alfonse Kalazorn, the ranch owner. Characters of 4th level or higher should be able to save Big Al and his ranch without hardship.

## Location Overview
Alfonse Kalazorn used to be the sheriff of Triboar, a town to the east, where he was known as Big Al Kalazorn. He retired a decade ago, but retirement didn't sit well with him. Looking for a new challenge, he claimed a plot of fertile land five miles east of Conyberry and turned it into a cattle and horse ranch. Later, he added a pig farm, chicken coops, vegetable gardens, corn fields, and an apple orchard. Most of his money comes from the sale of butter skulls—lumps of butter cleverly molded into the shapes of humanoid skulls. He sells his butter skulls primarily in towns to the east, although a few make their way to Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin. Big Al's butter is made from the milk of Petunia, his prized cow.

When the white dragon Cryovain drove the orcs out of Icespire Hold, they descended into the lowlands. A tenday ago, a small band of them attacked the ranch, freeing the pigs before setting fire to the barn and the smithy. A few other animals, including a dozen horses and Petunia the cow, escaped during the blaze. Big Al and five of his ranch hands were not so lucky. In their attempt to fend off the orcs, Big Al was captured and the ranch hands were killed. The only surviving hand escaped on horseback, fled to Phandalin, and delivered news of the attack.

### Quest Goals
To complete the Butterskull Ranch Quest ("Follow-Up Quests"), adventurers must rescue Alfonse Kalazorn and either convince him to return to Phandalin or rid his ranch of orcs. Alfonse also wants help finding his prized cow, promising a splendid reward in exchange.

## Travel to the Ranch
The fastest and safest way to Butterskull Ranch from Phandalin is to follow the Triboar Trail northeast. The trek is 60 miles long, and characters can walk about 24 miles in a day. Thus, they can expect to take two long rests in the course of the journey.

### Encounters on the Way
The characters have the following encounters as they travel to the ranch.

#### Horses in Conyberry
The abandoned town of Conyberry is eerily silent except for the whistling of the wind as it blows through the settlement's burned and crumbled-down structures. As the characters make their way through or around the ruins, they spot three unsaddled **riding horses** grazing near an old well. Anyone who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check sees that the horses are branded with the letters BAK (for Big Al Kalazorn). A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can approach a horse without startling it, and can even ride it.

#### Petunia the Cow
Between Conyberry and the ranch, the characters spot Petunia the **cow** in a field a few hundred feet off the Triboar Trail. Petunia wears a cowbell around her neck. Characters who approach her spot a brand on her hindquarters: the letters BAK. Petunia has a calm, unflappable demeanor. If treated well, she follows her new benefactors everywhere.

## Arrival
The following locations are keyed to the map of Butterskull Ranch. When the adventurers come within sight of the ranch, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Butterskull Ranch occupies a large plot of land on the north side of the Triboar Trail, nestled between two hills. Beyond a ramshackle wooden fence stand corn fields, an apple orchard, gardens, and pasture land. A path breaks off from the trail to lead to a two-story farmhouse next to a pond. West of the farmhouse are the charred remains of a barn and smithy that have been burned to the ground.
>>

Pigs harmlessly wander the fields, gardens, and orchard. Between the farmhouse and the gutted barn lie the scattered corpses of two orcs and five humans (ranch hands) swarming with flies. The bodies carry nothing of value.

![[010-map-br-pc.jpg|right|300]]
### Exploring the Farmhouse
The farmhouse is a two-story log building with a pitched, shingled roof and a stone chimney. Its wooden doors are set with iron handles and hinges. Its windows are fitted with wooden shutters that can be bolted shut from inside. All the shutters are open when the characters arrive.

Raucous **orcs** dwell in the farmhouse, consuming Big Al's ale and food stores. There are three times as many orcs as there are characters in the party, not including sidekicks. Place the orcs in areas B1 through B9 as you see fit. The orcs are not expecting trouble, but they fight to the death.

#### B1. Kitchen
The front door of the house leads into this area, which holds a large butter churn, worktables, shelves of foodstuffs and ale, and hanging pots and pans. Atop a small table is a skull-shaped wooden butter mold.

#### B2. Empty Foyer
A creaky wooden staircase ascends from here to area B5.

#### B3. Dining Room
This room contains two wooden trestle tables flanked by benches. Cattle skulls on the walls add to the decor.

#### B4. Downstairs Closet
This closet contains shelves holding dinnerware.

#### B5. Common Room
Padded chairs and game tables are arranged about this room. Scattered on the floor are *Three-Dragon Ante* playing cards and wooden *Dragonchess* pieces.

#### B6. Big Al's Bedroom
A large bed and a bulky cedar wardrobe dominate this room, which also has framed paintings of landscapes hanging on the walls.

***Treasure.*** Any character who searches the wardrobe and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a secret compartment at the bottom, stuffed inside which is a suit of *mithral chain mail*. (If the characters acquire and identify this magic item, give them the *Mithral Chain Mail* card or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).)

#### B7. Ranch Hands' Bedrooms
Each of these rooms contains two beds and two footlockers. Each footlocker contains neatly folded clothing and worthless personal effects.

#### B8. Big Al's Office
Big Al's desk is buried under stacks of ledgers and papers chronicling ten years' worth of business transactions.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the messy office find a small sack buried under the paperwork. It contains earnings and wages: a total of 65 gp, 145 sp, and 220 cp.

#### B9. Upstairs Closet
This closet contains a mop, a broom, and a bucket.

#### B10. Cold Storage Cellar
Wooden doors set against the north side of the farmhouse cover stone stairs leading down to the cellar. When the characters explore the cellar, read the following text:

>>The cellar has a dirt floor, walls of mortared stone, and an eight-foot-high plank ceiling braced by wooden pillars. Tied to a chair is a large figure with a burlap sack pulled over his head. Shelves along the walls are lined with skulls made of butter and protected by a thin coating of wax.
>>

The bound figure is Alfonse Kalazorn, a human **veteran**. It takes 1 minute for a character to free Big Al from his rope bonds. Having been beaten by the orcs, he has 9 hit points remaining and appreciates any healing the characters can provide. He is also without weapons and armor (AC 11).

Once liberated, Big Al can be convinced to abandon his ranch by any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check. But he would rather stay, borrow a weapon, and kill any orcs that remain.

Big Al can't turn a profit without his prized cow. He offers his suit of *mithral chain mail* (hidden in area B6) as a reward for her safe return. If the characters didn't bring Petunia with them, they can scour the countryside for her. At the end of each hour spent searching, roll a d6. On a roll of 6, the party finds Petunia. If one or more characters search on horseback, they find Petunia on a roll of 5 or 6.

# Circle of Thunder
"Circle of Thunder" is balanced for characters of 6th level, though characters of 4th or 5th level can weather its challenges if they are cautious.

No quest leads the party to this location. However, characters who brave *Dragon Barrow* might come here with Xanth the **centaur**, while those who raid the *Woodland Manse* might be led here by Grannoc's map. In the aftermath of the counterattack on Falcon's Hunting Lodge (see "Counterattack!" on page 47), characters can follow Gorthok's trail back to the Circle of Thunder, where that creature was summoned.

## Location Overview
The reclusive anchorites of the Circle of Thunder gather on this hill to make sacrifices to Talos the storm god. In stormy weather, the anchorites also perform rituals to summon **Gorthok the Thunder Boar**, a destructive force they can unleash against their enemies. A circle of standing stones atop the hill helps to focus the anchorites' magic to make the summoning of Gorthok possible.

Three anchorites—Flenz, Narux, and Yargath—defend the hill. When not performing rituals in the circle of standing stones, they patrol the surrounding woods, forage for food, and lurk in caves dug out of the hillside. When the characters arrive, the anchorites are gathered on the hilltop. If Gorthok has not been defeated yet, the anchorites are in the midst of summoning the great boar. Otherwise, they are conjuring a storm.

> ##### Cave Descriptions
>Three caves are set beneath the hilltop, each serving as the lair of an **anchorite of Talos**. The caves are dug out of the earth, with each cave mouth braced by two rectangular stone slabs topped with a heavy lintel stone. All the caves have 7-foot-high ceilings and crude wooden gates for doors. Each cave features a different layout but has similar contents.
>
>***A: Entryway.*** Situated in the middle of this intersection, facing the cave mouth, the skull of a boar rests atop a pile of humanoid and animal bones. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check can ascertain that the bones are a warning to stay away.

>***B: Boar Pen.*** The gate to this room is lashed shut with rope. It holds a **boar** that is the anchorite's companion and garbage disposal. The boar can't harm anyone while trapped in this room. If the gate is opened by anyone other than an **anchorite of Talos**, the boar tries to flee the cave, attacking anyone in its path.

>***C: Cell.*** The gate to this cell is lashed shut with rope. The cell is used to hold animals doomed to be sacrificed in rituals to Talos. There's a 25 percent chance that a harmless deer is trapped inside. Otherwise, the cell is empty.

>***D: Anchorite's Retreat.*** This unfurnished room serves as the anchorite's quarters. Niches in the walls hold clay dishware, wooden utensils, gathered berries, bundled herbs, and creepy totems. In areas C2 and area C3, the anchorites have hidden treasure buried under the earthen floor in a random 5-foot square. See those areas for details of the treasure.

>***E: Secret Exit.*** This tunnel slopes up to a secret trapdoor that is plainly visible from the underside.

## Travel to the Circle
Characters traveling to the Circle of Thunder have the following two encounters en route.

### Tree Trap
This encounter can occur anywhere in Neverwinter Wood. Set the scene by reading the following boxed text:

>>You come upon a sixty-foot-wide forest clearing, in the middle of which is a black, needle-like spire—a forty-foot-tall pine tree ravaged by fire long ago, its limbs burned off. Tied to the dead tree near its base are several ghastly dolls made of twigs bound with black hair.
>>

Ten twig dolls are bound to the charred tree, all within easy reach. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic emanating from the tree and the ground in a 60-foot radius around it.

Close examination of a twig doll reveals something wrapped inside it. By breaking a doll apart, characters can see that it contains a still-beating pig's heart. Any damage to a heart kills it and causes the dead tree's roots to magically animate and erupt from the ground.

When the constricting roots erupt, each creature standing in the clearing must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage and be restrained. The creature takes this damage again at the start of each of its turns until it escapes. A creature can use an action to free itself or another creature within its reach with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, or by dealing 5 or more slashing damage against a root with a single melee weapon attack. The roots have AC 13 and immunity to all damage except slashing.

### Yargath's Patrol
As they move through the forest, the characters are beset by Yargath, an **anchorite of Talos**, and a band of **orcs**—two orcs per character in the party, including sidekicks. Set the scene as follows:

>>As you make your way across uneven ground rising to a ridge, several hulking orcs ascend a similar ridge across from you, separated from you by a sixty-foot-wide, ten-foot-deep gully. The orcs unleash terrible battle cries as they are joined by a humanoid with elongated claws.
>>

***On the first round of combat, Yargath casts bless on up to three orcs. Meanwhile, the orcs charge across the ravine and close to melee range.*** 

***Treasure.*** Yargath carries a *potion of greater healing*. If the characters acquire this potion, give the players the *Potion of Greater Healing* card or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

## Arrival
Characters coming from the *Woodland Manse* approach the Circle of Thunder from the south. Describe the location to the players as follows:

>>Ominous storm clouds gather in the sky as you approach a ninety-foot-tall hill with trees spreading across its slopes. Atop the hill is a large ring of standing stones. Two ghastly figures dance within this henge, surrounded by a number of smaller capering creatures.
>>

The standing stones and the dancing figures are described in area C1. Characters who circle the hill before climbing it spot three caves (areas C2, area C3, and area C4) near the hilltop.

### Circle of Thunder Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of the Circle of Thunder.

![[012-map-cot-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### C1. Henge
Atop the hill is a ring of eight upright stone structures, each one consisting of two 10-foot-high vertical stone slabs spaced 5 feet apart and topped with a 3-foot-thick flat lintel stone. These uprights can be toppled by creatures with a combined Strength score of 80 or higher.

In the middle of the circle, two humanoid figures dance around a deer carcass, each wearing the rotting head of a boar as a mask. These foes are Flenz and Narux, two **anchorites of Talos**. They are joined by frolicking **twig blights**—two blights for each character in the party, including sidekicks. Flenz and Narux are either performing a ritual to summon **Gorthok the Thunder Boar**, or they are making a sacrifice to appease Talos and call forth a storm. If the characters have not yet defeated Gorthok, the boar arrives once both anchorites are dead, appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the circle with a thunderclap. Gorthok fights to the death.

***Secret Trapdoors.*** Any character who searches the hilltop and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds one of three flimsy wooden trapdoors hidden under the grass and dirt. Below these trapdoors are tunnels leading to areas C2, C3, and C4.

#### C2. Northwest Cave
Carved into the lintel stone above the cave mouth is a picture of a boar chasing after a stick-figure humanoid.

***Treasure.*** Flenz hides a *potion of invulnerability* in his quarters, buried in a random square beneath the floor. If the characters obtain the potion, give the players the *Potion of Invulnerability* card or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### C3. Northeast Cave
The lintel stone above the mouth of this cave is bare.

***Treasure.*** Narux hides a *+1 shield* in his quarters, buried beneath the floor. If the characters obtain and identify it, give the players the *+1 Shield* card or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### C4. Southeast Cave
Carved into the lintel stone above the mouth of this cave is a pictograph depicting three stick-figure humanoids being struck by lightning. Yargath keeps no treasure here.

# Dragon Barrow
"Dragon Barrow" is balanced for characters of 5th level, though characters of 4th level can survive this quest if they are cautious and rest between encounters. Characters of 6th level or higher should have no trouble plundering the barrow and surviving its challenges.

## Location Overview
Lady Tanamere Alagondar was a royal scion of Neverwinter more than a century ago. Along with two parties of adventurers, she fought and killed Azdraka, a green dragon that had long terrorized the High Road. Lady Alagondar died in the battle and was laid to rest beneath a barrow near where the dragon fell. The remains of her fallen compatriots and the corpse of Azdraka were sealed in the barrow with her, in accordance with Lady Alagondar's dying wishes.

### Quest Goals
To complete the Dragon Barrow Quest, the adventurers must retrieve Lady Alagondar's *dragon slayer longsword* which, according to legend, was buried with her.

## Travel to the Barrow
The barrow is roughly 40 miles northwest of Phandalin, amid the rolling hills and grasslands between the High Road and Neverwinter Wood. Since the characters can travel roughly 24 miles in a day, they should expect to take one long rest in the wilderness before arriving at the barrow on the second day of their trek. A cold wind blowing in from the coast assails them for most of the trip, bringing occasional rain.

### Centaur of Attention
After being driven from his home in Neverwinter Wood by marauding orcs, Xanth the **centaur** has taken refuge in the hills around the barrow. When he spots the characters, Xanth approaches peacefully and shares the following warnings:

- "Strange witchlights hover over Dragon Barrow at night. The hill is haunted by the restless spirits of the dead."
- "Neverwinter Wood has become overrun with orcs in league with half-orc spellcasters. Deep in the forest, atop a cave-riddled hill, is a circle of standing stones where the evil half-orcs perform their dark rites."

Xanth avoids Dragon Barrow and would like to see the evil half-orc spellcasters of Neverwinter Wood driven off or killed. He offers to guide characters to the *Circle of Thunder* if they wish to take on the half-orcs there, and is willing to wait until the characters are done exploring the barrow. The Circle of Thunder is roughly 40 miles away, deep within the forest.

> ##### Catacombs Features
>A series of chambers and tunnels at ground level form the catacombs beneath the barrow mound. They reek of damp earth and stale, deathly air.
>
>***Ceilings.*** Ceilings throughout are 8 feet high and flat.

>***Earthen Construction.*** All tunnels and rooms have walls, floors, and roofs made of packed earth.

>***Light.*** There is no light within the barrow. Adventurers require darkvision or their own light sources to see inside.

>***Sarcophagi.*** The sarcophagi found throughout the catacombs are carved from solid blocks of granite and sealed with heavy granite lids. The seals are airtight. Lifting a lid requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Each lid is a Medium object with AC 17, 12 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

## Arrival
When the adventurers come within sight of the barrow, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>A thirty-foot-high hill rises ahead of you, its top too flat to be a natural occurrence. Jutting from the grassy hilltop is a row of ten-foot-tall, bone-white rocks that arc toward the stormy sky like outstretched talons.
>>

Characters who climb to the top of the barrow and survey it notice its distinctive dragon-like shape with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check. The pale rocks resemble spikes protruding from the dragon's back.

At night, the **will-o'-wisps** in *area D2* emerge from the hill using their Incorporeal Movement and float above the barrow, hoping to attract prey with their lights. If they detect characters nearby, the will-o'-wisps turn invisible and withdraw into the barrow.

### Barrow Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of Dragon Barrow.

![[014-map-db-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### D1. Secret Entrance
One of the white rocks atop the hill acts as a stone plug embedded in the earth. Characters searching the hilltop can spot a opening beneath the base of the rock with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. By lashing ropes around the top of the rock, the characters can topple it with a successful DC 19 Strength (Athletics) check. A *knock* spell also causes it to topple over. The opening beneath the rock reveals a 2-foot-wide spiral staircase with flagstone steps, descending 30 feet to area D2.

#### D2. Will-o'-Wisps
The tunnels around the spiral staircase are haunted by three **will-o'-wisps**. The wisps are invisible until they hear intruders coming down the stairs, whereupon they illuminate and move to the far side of the three concealed pit traps (area D3), hoping to lure intruders to their doom. Each wisp has its own pit and attacks any character who falls into it. A wisp reduced to 7 hit points or fewer turns invisible on its next turn and flees to hide until the characters leave the barrow.

#### D3. Concealed Pit Traps
Each of these pits is 5 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and dug out of the earth. Rows of rusty swords are embedded into the floor of each pit, whose tops are covered by rotted wooden planks hidden under a thin layer of earth. A creature using a pole or similar tool to prod ahead detects the pit with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

Any creature that steps onto a pit falls into it, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage and impaling itself on 1d4 swords, each of which deals 1d6 piercing damage.

#### D4. Skeletal Surprise
The bones and rotting saddle of Lady Alagondar's horse lie in the southern niche of this cavern. When a creature approaches within 5 feet of the bones, they knit together and rise as a skeletal horse. This steed has the statistics of a **riding horse**, except that it's undead. It bonds with any character who wants to ride it.

#### D5. Narrow Tunnel
This tunnel is only 2 feet wide. At the halfway point, a 5-foot-long pressure plate is hidden under a 2-inch-thick layer of earth. A character prodding ahead with a pole or similar tool can detect the plate with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. The first character to step on the plate causes the walls of the tunnel to collapse inward, burying all creatures in the tunnel. A buried creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks, and begins to suffocate when it runs out of breath (see "*Suffocation*" in *the rulebook*). Only a creature that is not trapped in the tunnel can clear away the collapse, using an action to open up the 5-foot-deep section of tunnel closest to it. A creature in that space is no longer buried.

#### D6. False Tomb
Two sealed stone sarcophagi rest in alcoves dug into the south wall here. Each sarcophagus releases a cloud of corrosive dust when opened, filling the 10-foot-by-10-foot area north of the sarcophagus. Any creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cloud then disappears. The sarcophagi contain nothing of interest.

#### D7. Adventurers' Sepulcher
Four sarcophagi in alcoves contain the moldy bones of adventurers (a bard, a cleric, a fighter, and a wizard) who perished fighting Azdraka.

***Treasure.*** The northwest sarcophagus contains the dead bard, who was buried with a *lute of illusions*. Sealed with the dead wizard in the southeast sarcophagus is a *necklace of fireballs*. If the characters acquire and identify these magic items, give them the *Lute of Illusions* and *Necklace of Fireballs* cards or they can reference them in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### D8. Dragon Slayer
Two sarcophagi in alcoves contain the moldy bones and rusty armor of Tanamere Alagondar and her faithful squire, but hold nothing of value. The area north of the sarcophagi has the bones of Azdraka, a Huge dragon, embedded in its walls. The dragon's skull rests on the floor and has a longsword set atop it.

***Treasure.*** The sword is Lady Alagondar's *dragon slayer*. Give the *Dragon Slayer* card to whoever takes it or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing). If the sword is taken, an **invisible stalker** appears and attacks anyone in this area until the sword is put back, or until that guardian is destroyed.

# Dwarven Excavation
"Dwarven Excavation" is balanced for characters of 1st level, though even characters of 2nd level will find certain elements of the quest challenging. Characters of 3rd level or higher should have an easy time clearing out the ruins and defeating the orcs that arrive later.

## Location Overview
Dazlyn Grayshard and Norbus Ironrune are shield dwarf prospectors and business partners. While looking for gold in the mountains southwest of Phandalin, they decided to explore a nearby canyon and found evidence of an ancient dwarven settlement buried by an avalanche. They've spent the past several months clearing the rubble and scouring the ruins for treasure, but have found nothing of value so far.

Behind the settlement, carved into the back wall of the canyon, is an old temple of Abbathor, the evil dwarven god of greed. During solar eclipses, Abbathor is appeased with sacrifices of blood and gemstones. On one occasion, the god found the sacrifices of this temple's priests lacking, so he caused an earthquake and avalanche that collapsed parts of the temple and buried the settlement. The priests in the temple who were not killed outright were transformed into ochre jellies—debased reflections of Abbathor's hunger and greed.

### Quest Goals
To complete the Dwarven Excavation Quest, the adventurers need only to warn Dazlyn and Norbus of the white dragon. The grateful dwarves then tempt the adventurers with a quest of their own, offering their pair of *sending stones* as a reward if the characters rid the temple of the monsters within. If they stay long enough to help Dazlyn and Norbus, the characters encounter orcs before they leave (see "When Orcs Attack").

## Arrival
The dwarven excavation lies due east of Leilon, 15 miles southwest of Phandalin, at the eastern end of a canyon (area E1). When the characters reach area E1 on the map, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The canyon's rocky walls rise to a height of eighty feet. At the end of the canyon, a twenty-foot-high wall of black stone has a broken gate carved into it, with one stone door hanging precariously by a hinge and the other door missing. Beyond this open gate, in the shadow of a great mountain to the east, lies a ruined settlement. All is quiet.
>>

If the characters announce their arrival, Dazlyn and Norbus come forth to greet them. Otherwise, the characters encounter the dwarves in area E3.

### Excavation Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of the dwarven excavation.

![[016-map-de-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### E1. Canyon
The canyon floor is strewn with rubble and bereft of vegetation except for a few tough, scraggly weeds.

#### E2. Ruined Settlement
All knowledge of this settlement, including its name, vanished along with its original inhabitants, who were killed by an avalanche. The rubble that once buried the settlement has been hauled away, leaving the outlines of stone buildings visible as collapsed walls. A stone well on the far side of the ruins is filled with rubble.

The settlement has been thoroughly ransacked. Characters who search the ruins find a few crushed dwarf bones and signs of recent campfires, but nothing of value.

#### E3. Courtyard and Temple Facade
Describe this location as follows:

>>A partially collapsed, ten-foot-high wall separates this courtyard from the settlement west of it. Three heaps of rubble are piled high in this area. Hewn from the canyon's back wall, a thirty-foot-high temple facade features steps rising to a stone platform. Cut into this facade is a ten-foot-high open doorway flanked by crumbling, life-sized granite statues of cloaked dwarves. Evil grins can be seen on their weatherworn faces.
>>

If they haven't been encountered yet, Dazlyn and Norbus are eating rations behind the easternmost rubble pile while keeping an eye on the temple entrance (area E4). Each is a shield dwarf **commoner** who speaks Common and Dwarvish, and who has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Dazlyn is forthright and honest to a fault. Norbus is gruff and excessively cautious. They banter like an old married couple.

Each dwarf has ten days of *rations*, a *waterskin*, mining tools, and one of two matching *sending stones*. The dwarves offer these magic items to anyone willing to kill the **ochre jellies** in area E5, search the temple for other obvious threats, and make it safe. If the characters obtain these stones, give the players both *Sending Stone* cards or they can reference them in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing). Eager to resume their excavation, the dwarves offer to split what they find with characters who help them.

> ##### Temple Features
>The temple (areas E4 through E11) is smoothly hewn from solid rock. The following features are common throughout.
>
>***Ceilings.*** Ceilings throughout are 10 feet high and flat.

>***Doors.*** All doors are made of carved stone with stone pins for hinges. Secret doors blend in with the surrounding stonework. Finding a secret door requires a search of the wall and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Dazlyn and Norbus have found one secret door thus far, in area E4. The others have yet to be discovered.

>***Dust and Debris.*** The temple is choked with dusty rubble. Rubble-filled squares are *difficult terrain* (see *the rulebook*).

>***Light.*** There are no light sources in the temple, since the dwarf priests of Abbathor relied on darkvision to see.

#### E4. Dusty Foyer
Spikes hammered into the floor hold open two sets of double doors. A once-secret door to the north stands open, with a room beyond it holding nothing but rubble.

#### E5. Temple
This area contains five secret doors, including one that opens up into one of the stone pillars holding up the ceiling. A bloodstained limestone altar stands at the far end of the room. Dazlyn and Norbus got this far into the temple before an **ochre jelly** scared them off. It clings to the ceiling above the altar. If the party includes two or more characters (not counting sidekicks), a second ochre jelly clings to the south wall.

***Treasure.*** The secret door in the pillar conceals a cavity packed with dwarf skulls that tumble out when the door is opened. At the bottom of the cavity is an unlocked stone coffer containing 15 gemstones worth 10 gp each.

#### E6. Partially Collapsed Room
An earthquake collapsed part of this room, which holds nothing of value.

#### E7. Secret Tunnel
Trapped behind the secret doors, an **ochre jelly** lurks in the rubble at the south end of this hall.

#### E8. Priests' Bedchamber
Three stone bed frames stand against the east wall.

#### E9. Vestry
An empty stone font juts out of the southwest wall. A stone wardrobe against the east wall holds the rotted remains of two suits of red leather armor (vestments worn by priests of Abbathor, now ruined and worthless).

#### E10. Partially Collapsed Room
Half-buried in the rubble here is the skeleton of a dwarf priest wearing rotted red leather armor. The dwarf was killed when part of the room collapsed.

***Treasure.*** Around the skeleton's neck hangs a holy symbol of Abbathor: a tiny jeweled dagger on a silver chain. The symbol is inscribed with Dwarvish runes that translate to "Greed is good," and is worth 50 gp.

#### E11. Hall of Greed
To reach this room, the characters must clear away the rubble that seals it off, which takes a single character 40 hours. Multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately.

An alcove in the south wall holds the rubble of a shattered statue. An alcove to the north holds a statue of a dwarf with horns, which stares greedily at a glowing green gem in its hands. If the gem is taken, it turns to dust and the statue explodes. Any creature within 10 feet of the exploding statue must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## When Orcs Attack
**Orcs** arrive at area E1 as the characters conclude their business with the dwarves. The number of orcs is equal to the number of characters in the party, including sidekicks. Driven from their territory by Cryovain, the orcs are looking for a new lair and fight to the death.
---
# Falcon's Hunting Lodge
Falcon's Hunting Lodge is a sanctuary in the heart of Neverwinter Wood. This location is not connected to any quest, but the characters might come here while undertaking other quests or exploring the forest.

## Location Overview
**Falcon the Hunter** maintains this hunting lodge to cater to nobles from Neverwinter. He offers his services as a guide to those nobles, most of whom wouldn't last long in the forest without his protection and survival skills. Falcon abhors city life, preferring a rustic existence and simple pleasures. His lodge has all the creature comforts he requires, though he never turns down a good bottle of wine (or even a bad one) from a visitor.

Falcon has two retainers: an elderly, world-weary cook named Corwin, and a mute twelve-year-old stablehand named Pell. Both are noncombatants.

In addition to the main house, the hunting lodge grounds include a guest house for visitors, a conjoined stable house and smithy, an outhouse, and pens to hold Falcon's livestock. Accustomed to long and lonely winters, Falcon keeps a season's worth of provisions in his pantry at all times, supplementing those stores with fresh game. He has also begun hunting orcs and mounting their heads in his trophy hall. Corwin has advised Falcon not to do this for fear of retaliation, but Falcon has a long history of killing orcs and can't abide them as neighbors.

Visitors are free to stay in the guest house and dine with Falcon at no charge. For discriminating guests, Falcon offers a comfortable private room in the main lodge (area F12) for 10 gp a night.

## Arrival
The following description assumes that the characters approach the lodge from the west side of the river:

>>A thin fog surrounds a fortified compound standing in a clearing on the east side of a narrow river. A ten-foot-high log palisade surrounds the compound, whose main building is a two-story stone-and-wood affair with a high-pitched roof, gables, window shutters, and a stone chimney. Attached to the main building is a blocky tower of gray stone, its high roof lined with battlements. Other structures include a two-story stable house and a gatehouse whose flat roof is enclosed by iron railings. A stone bridge spans the river, ending before an oaken door set into the gatehouse's outer wall. Mounted next to the door is a bell with a short rope hanging from its clapper.
>>

If the characters announce their arrival by ringing the bell or yelling over the walls, Corwin makes his way over to assess them from the gatehouse, slides back the heavy wooden bar securing the outside door, and lets them in. If the characters have horses or pack animals, Corwin has Pell look after them while he shows the characters to the guest house (area F3) to store their gear. He then leads them to the dining and trophy hall (area F11) before fetching Falcon, who is usually in his quarters at area F13.

### Roleplaying Falcon
**Falcon the Hunter** wears a fur-lined cloak over his studded leather armor. He stands 6 feet, 6 inches tall, and has black hair and broad shoulders. His eyes are as blue, cold, and sharp as ice, and he sports a neatly trimmed beard. Falcon moves with the casual confidence of one who fears nothing, and he greets every concern with nonplussed indifference. He loves good wine and treats other people as he would like to be treated—fairly and with patience.

Falcon's real name is Gustaf Stellern, but he has long since abandoned it. His hunting skills have earned him the name he now bears. Given the chance, he shares the following useful information with the characters:

- "I've seen more orcs in the woods of late. Ugly brutes."
- "The orcs appear to be in league with the evil half-orcs that dwell southeast of here. These half-orcs are often seen in the company of little stick creatures known to creep about these woods. All in all, a nasty lot."
- "The half-orcs dwell in a ruined stone manse overgrown with vines, roughly ten miles from here. Tales say that the manse was built by a scholar who studied the elven ruins scattered throughout these woods."

#### Woodland Manse Quest
If the characters are eligible to undertake the Woodland Manse Quest, Falcon offers a pair of *boots of elvenkind* as a reward for completing it. Give the players the *Boots of Elvenkind* card once the boots are acquired or they can reference them in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

Falcon politely declines any offer to join the characters on a quest, stating that he must remain at the lodge in case nobles from Neverwinter come looking for his services.

> ##### Lodge Features
>The map of Falcon's Hunting Lodge shows the upper levels and main levels of the buildings, as well as the main level's two courtyards—one to the north and one to the south. Other features are summarized below.
>
>***Animal Pens.*** The pens extend east from the south yard and are divided by wooden fences. They hold two dozen chickens and a rooster, six pigs, and four goats. The animals are well treated and not dangerous.

>***Ceilings.*** Interior ceilings are 9 feet high and flat.

>***Doors.*** Doors are made of sturdy oak fitted with iron handles and hinges. Exterior doors are barred from the inside. A creature can use an action to force open a barred door with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Each door is a Medium object with AC 15, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

>***Light.*** At sundown, Corwin lights oil lanterns that hang from hooks on the walls in all interior locations.

>***Palisade.*** The log palisade is 10 feet high and designed to keep wild forest animals at bay, not hold off armies. A character can scale a palisade wall with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

### Lodge Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of Falcon's Hunting lodge.

![[018-map-fhl-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### F1. Stone Bridge
The 5-foot-wide stone bridge that spans the river is sturdy and newly built.

#### F2. Gatehouse

# Gnomengarde
"Gnomengarde" is balanced for characters of 1st level, though characters of 2nd level might find certain traps and hazards challenging. Characters of 3rd level or higher should be able to deal with the unexpected trouble here and get what they need from the rock gnomes without having to expend many resources, though the roleplaying in this quest should be fun regardless.

## Location Overview
The caves of Gnomengarde are carved into the base of a mountain southeast of Phandalin, around a narrow waterfall. The rock gnome wizards who occupy these caves form strategic alliances with their human and dwarf neighbors as needs warrant. Reclusive and secretive, the gnomes craft minor magic items and useful, nonmagical inventions to pass the time. In these endeavors, their failures outnumber their successes. They seldom stray far from home, subsisting largely on the mushrooms that grow on misty islands outside their caves.

Gnomengarde has two married kings who rule in tandem—Gnerkli and Korboz. Korboz recently lost his mind and is keeping Gnerkli as his prisoner. Their subjects don't understand the nature of Korboz's affliction, and are at a loss as to what to do. They wish no harm to befall either king, but they acknowledge that Korboz has become a danger to himself and others.

In addition to the danger posed by the mad king, two gnomes have mysteriously vanished within the last tenday. No one except King Korboz knows that a shapechanging monster (a mimic) has crept into Gnomengarde and is feeding on the gnomes, changing its appearance as it makes its way through the complex. Korboz was attacked and almost killed by the creature, with that event inspiring his madness. He has sequestered himself and his beloved Gnerkli in their quarters because he doesn't want the monstrous shapechanger to devour them. Korboz hopes the creature will tire of eating gnomes and leave. Providing Korboz with evidence of the mimic's demise restores his sanity.

> ##### Gnomengarde Features
>Gnomengarde's caves are hewn from solid rock and share the following features.
>
>***Ceilings.*** Ceilings throughout are 7 feet high and flat.

>***Doors.*** Normal doors are made of wood fitted with rusty iron handles and hinges. A locked door can be opened with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using *thieves' tools*. A locked door can be forced open as an action with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding stonework. Finding a secret door requires a search of the wall and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

>***Light.*** All caves are illuminated by hanging oil lanterns attached to rope-and-pulley mechanisms that make it easy for the gnomes to lower the lanterns and refill them with oil.

>***Waterfall.*** The caves of Gnomengarde echo with the roar of the nearby waterfall. The sound is so loud that gnomes and visitors must shout to be heard unless there's a closed door between them and the waterfall.

### Quest Goals
To complete the Gnomengarde Quest, the characters must obtain at least one magic item from the gnomes. Of the items they can secure, only the *hat of wizardry* interests Townmaster Harbin Wester, who offers to buy it for 50 gp even though he knows no one who can attune to it. However, the gnomes won't hand over any magic items until the characters speak to Fibblestib and Dabbledob in area G11.

#### Gnome-Made Magic Items
If the characters rescue Gnerkli and end Korboz's madness, the grateful gnomes give them a *clockwork amulet* and *pole of collapsing* (from area G13). The characters also receive a gift from each king: a *wand of pyrotechnics* from Gnerkli and a *hat of wizardry* from Korboz. Give the players the *Clockwork Amulet*, *Hat of Wizardry*, *Pole of Collapsing*, and *Wand of Pyrotechnics* cards as their characters obtain and identify each item or they can reference them in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

## Arrival
A stream leads the characters to a pool fed by a waterfall that tumbles down the mountainside. Describe Gnomengarde's location to the players as follows:

>>You follow a stream uphill to the base of the mountain, where waterfall erosion has carved out a natural concavity. The roaring waterfall creates a cloud of mist as it plunges into a shallow pool of water, within which rise two small islands covered with two-foot-tall red, green, and purple mushrooms. Several cave openings overlook the pool from rocky ledges twenty to thirty feet above. The mountain blocks any sunlight from reaching this place.
>>

Gnomengarde has five cave entrances perched atop ledges with sheer, rocky slopes. Climbing to a cave requires a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. A narrow footpath ascends the northeast slope, making it an easy climb to that cave entrance without a check.

### Gnomengarde Roster
Twenty **rock gnome recluses** dwell in Gnomengarde, including King Gnerkli and King Korboz. The gnomes' names and locations are described in the "Gnomengarde Locations" section.

#### Mystery Monster
There used to be twenty-two gnomes living in the caves, but a **mimic** devoured two gnomes—named Orryn and Warryn—in the past tenday. The creature is currently disguised as a barrel in area G8, but it will devour more gnomes once its hunger returns unless it is dealt with. It can move around and adopt other disguises as needed, though its forms are limited to Medium objects such as chairs, large chests, lecterns, and weird gnomish inventions of the mimic's size and mass. The mimic can also disguise itself as a door, a false section of wall, or a rocky bulge on the floor.

After speaking to Korboz and learning about the presence of a shapechanging monster, the characters' primary goal should be to find and slay the creature. When it attacked Korboz, it looked like a 10-foot-square rug in the throne room (area G14), but it has since moved elsewhere and changed its appearance.

If pressed, the rock gnomes help the characters find the mimic by poking objects with nonmagical wands to see if they fight back. The gnomes aren't adventurers, however, and they flee at the first sign of danger (real or imagined).

The mimic completely devours and dissolves its victims, leaving no trace behind and relocating after each kill. It won't leave Gnomengarde of its own accord, as it's taken a liking to the taste of gnome flesh.

If you want a more interesting antagonist, make the mimic one of the rare varieties that can carry on simple conversations in Common. Characters who corner the talking mimic can negotiate with it, and can compel it to leave Gnomengarde with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check.

### Wild Magic
Wild magic is a kind of magic that can't be controlled, and Gnomengarde has long been a source of it. When a creature anywhere on the Gnomengarde map expends a spell slot to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, an additional effect might occur. Roll a d20 and consult the following table to determine the effect, if any. This wild magic effect lasts for 1 hour, or until ended with a *remove curse* spell or similar magic.

| d20 | Wild Magic Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1–6 | None |
| 7–10 | The caster's skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. |
| 11–14 | Tiny, insubstantial motes of light circle the caster, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. |
| 15–17 | The caster sprouts wings like those of a butterfly. The wings give the caster a flying speed of 30 feet. |
| 18–19 | The caster teleports up to 60 feet to a random unoccupied space of the DM's choice. |
| 20 | A whimsical effect of the DM's invention. |

### Gnomengarde Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of Gnomengarde.

![[020-map-gnomegarde-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### G1. Misty Pool and Mushroom Islands
The gnomes subsist on 2-foot-tall mushrooms that grow atop two small islands in the middle of this 3-foot-deep pool. The islands are perpetually shrouded in mist from the waterfall. Magic bestowed upon the islands by Gnomengarde's first settlers causes the mushrooms to grow to abnormally large size. This same magic is the source of Gnomengarde's wild magic (see above).

The mushrooms come in three colors. Red mushrooms provide oil that the gnomes use to fuel their lanterns and other mechanical devices. Green mushrooms are ground into flour and used to make a tasty green bread. Purple mushrooms are crushed and fermented to make mushroom wine, which tastes as good as it sounds.

#### G2. Waterfall and Rope Bridge
The waterfall plunges 60 feet, its mist lightly obscuring a 35-foot-long rope bridge firmly anchored to 20-foot-high ledges. The bridge is *difficult terrain* (see *the rulebook*), and sags so that its midpoint is only 15 feet above the water. A creature that falls or jumps from the bridge takes no damage if it lands in the water, which is 5 feet deep in the area below the bridge. The bridge has AC 11, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The barrel crab contraptions in area G6 are too clumsy to cross the bridge without getting tangled in its ropes.

#### G3. Dining Room
This room contains several dining tables and chairs sized for Small folk. A stout wooden cabinet against the east wall holds tin dishware and utensils.

#### G4. Kitchen
This kitchen is furnished with gnomes in mind, so everything is either close to the floor or readily reachable by tugging on an overly complicated rope-and-pulley mechanism. Five **rock gnome recluses** busy themselves here:

- Joybell (female) uses a poker to stoke the fire of a hot iron stove standing against the east wall.
- Dimble (male) uses a complicated press-like contraption to squeeze oil out of a big red mushroom and filter the liquid into four oil flasks.
- Panana (female) stands atop a low table and uses a mechanical rolling pin contraption to kneed green bread dough. The severed caps of several big green mushrooms are set around her.
- Uppendown (male) forms the dough into loaves of green bread, his tongue sticking out as he carefully shapes each loaf like a master sculptor.
- Tervaround (female) teeters on a stool as she stuffs a big purple mushroom into a barrel, so that it can ferment and be turned into mushroom wine.

Characters who question the gnomes are urged to speak to Fibblestib or Dabbledob in the workshop (area G11), as they know more about what's going on than any other gnomes in the complex. These gnomes won't leave the kitchen, but they can point characters in the right direction. The gnomes avoid talking about the missing gnomes or Mad King Korboz.

#### G5. Pantry
This room is piled high with small wooden crates. Each contains loaves of green mushroom bread and other foodstuffs collected and kept by the gnomes.

#### G6. Barrel Crabs
Parked in alcoves in this otherwise empty room are two gnomish contraptions. Each resembles a crab with a barrel for a shell, six articulated metal legs, and a pair of forward-facing pincer claws. A hatch on the top of each barrel opens to reveal an interior compartment equipped with a small, leather-padded seat surrounded by levers, pedals, and gears. The barrels are not airtight.

The gnomes built these crablike contraptions to grip and move other objects, rather like crude forklifts. However, the contraptions are so clumsy that they are useless for delicate work. They are just small enough to navigate Gnomengarde's 5-foot-wide passageways.

Each barrel crab is a Large object with AC 15, 30 hit points, a Strength score of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is designed to hold a single Small humanoid, though a Medium humanoid can fit inside with some discomfort. While in the barrel with the hatch closed, a creature has total cover against attacks from outside the contraption. It can use its action to make the contraption scuttle across the ground at a walking speed of 15 feet or make one attack with its pincer claws.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (2d4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 10).

#### G7. Autoloading Crossbow Platform
Bolted to the floor of this room is a rotating platform equipped with four heavy crossbows that reload automatically. Each crossbow comes with twenty bolts. Mounted above the crossbows at a height of 6 feet is a chair equipped with pedals that causes the entire contraption to spin counterclockwise, and with levers that reload and fire the crossbows. This clanking, clattering contraption is a Large object with AC 13, 45 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Every time it loses 10 hit points, one of its crossbows breaks.

A creature sitting in the chair can use an action to rotate the device up to 360 degrees counterclockwise and fire up to two of its crossbows in any direction. Each crossbow makes the following attack.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, range 50/200 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (1d10) piercing damage.

Sitting in the chair when the characters first enter this area is the device's inventor, a **rock gnome recluse** named Facktoré. When she sees strangers, Facktoré decides to test out the contraption on them. She stands down only when she or her contraption cease to function, or when she can no longer see any targets. Being deranged and utterly consumed by her work, she can barely string together a cohesive sentence, let alone advise visitors on where to go or whom to talk to.

#### G8. Mimic and Mushroom Wine
This room contains twelve forty-gallon barrels set into wide alcoves. Each barrel is secured by a wooden brace. The barrels in the south alcove have been tapped with wooden spigots. Two of those barrels are half full, and two are nearly empty.

Seven of the eight barrels in the north and east alcoves are untapped and full of mushroom wine. The eighth barrel is the **mimic**. You can decide where the mimic is, or roll a d8 to randomly determine which barrel is the fake one. See "Mystery Monster" for more information on the mimic and its behavior when discovered.

#### G9. Gnome Guard Post
Mist from the waterfall dampens this empty cave, which has a 10-foot-high ledge overlooking it to the south. The ledge can be reached by following the curved tunnel to the east, or by scaling the slick rock wall with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.

Two **rock gnome recluses** stand on the ledge—a female named Ulla and a male named Pog. When anyone enters the cave, Ulla calls out, "Who goes there?" in Gnomish, then Pog repeats the question in Common. Their orders are to "attack shapechangers on sight." Since anyone might be a shapechanger, they attack anyone who can't prove they are who they claim to be. Characters who don't want to be attacked must succeed on one of the following checks:

- A DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check to trick the gnomes into thinking the characters have an audience with the kings of Gnomengarde.
- A DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check to scare the gnomes into thinking that any harm visited upon the characters will result in Gnomengarde's destruction.
- A DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the gnomes that the characters can't be shapechangers, as shapechangers would surely take less conspicuous forms.

#### G10. Spinning Blades
This area is lightly obscured by mist from the waterfall. The larger eastern part of the room contains two rapidly spinning devices that look like turnstiles fitted with stacks of long, sharp blades spaced 1 foot apart. The northern turnstile spins counterclockwise, while the southern one spins clockwise. Any creature that enters or starts its turn in the eastern part of the room while the blades are spinning must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Set into the south wall of the smaller western part of the room is a brass lever in the down position. Pulling the lever up causes the turnstiles to stop spinning, allowing safe passage through the chamber. The rock gnomes bypass this trap by using the *mage hand* cantrip to move the lever from the east doorway.

#### G11. Inventors' Workshop
As the characters approach this area, they overhear an argument in Gnomish between two **rock gnome recluses**—a male named Fibblestib and a female named Dabbledob. As Gnomengarde's foremost inventors, they are trying to dream up an invention that will cure King Korboz's madness. Fibblestib's proposal is a "sanity ray." Dabbledob thinks that's dumb, and wants to build something called a "straitjacket" instead. If the characters interrupt them, the gnomes realize that the new arrivals might have another solution, so they fill in what's been happening and ask for any advice on how they might help cure Korboz and rescue King Gnerkli.

Fibblestib and Dabbledob consider the mystery of the vanishing gnomes of secondary importance to their mission of aiding their kings. They focus on Korboz and Gnerkli to the exclusion of all else, promising magical rewards in exchange for aid (see "Gnome-Made Magic Items").

The workshop is cluttered with half-completed gnomish inventions that serve no purpose, as well as worktables strewn with tinker's tools. A 10-foot-high ledge overlooks the room, set with a wooden pedestal on which sits a leather-bound book.

***Treasure.*** The book on the pedestal is a spellbook that the rock gnomes of Gnomengarde share. Its cover describes its title as *Magick of Gnomengarde* (in Common and Gnomish), and it contains the wizard spells *burning hands*, *detect magic*, *identify*, *mage armor*, *magic missile*, *shield*, and *sleep*.

#### G12. Gnome Domiciles
The floor of this cave is strewn with the remnants of old campfires. Four side caves serve as sleeping areas, with five small wooden cots crammed into each one. Eight **rock gnome recluses** sleep soundly here when the characters first arrive, with two gnomes in each side cave—Caramip, Jabby, Nyx, and Quippy (females), and Anverth, Delebean, Pallabar, and Zook (males). Characters can move through the area without waking the sleeping gnomes, who defend themselves if attacked but pose no danger otherwise. They avoid talking about the recent troubles, but advise visitors to speak with Fibblestib and Dabbledob (see area G11), Gnomengarde's two most gifted rock gnome inventors.

#### G13. Treasury
The door to this room is locked, and Fibblestib and Dabbledob (see area G11) carry the keys. The room contains a jumble of nonfunctional gnomish gizmos, as well as loose gears, twisted bits of metal, and other scraps that the gnomes use to cobble together new inventions.

***Treasure.*** Amid the clutter, the characters can find a *clockwork amulet* and a *pole of collapsing*, most easily by scanning the room with a *detect magic* spell. It otherwise takes 1 hour to find each item. Give the players the *Clockwork Amulet* and *Pole of Collapsing* cards if their characters acquire and identify these magic items or they can reference them in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### G14. Throne Room
Situated atop a stone dais are two squat thrones made of scrap metal and sized for gnomes. A secret door in the north wall conceals a short tunnel leading to area G15. Only the gnome kings know of this secret passage.

#### G15. Gnome Kings' Bedroom
King Korboz has locked himself and King Gnerkli in their bedroom, forgetting that there's a secret door that others could find and use to gain entry. Only Korboz and Gnerkli have keys to the locked main door. If the characters knock on the door or otherwise announce their arrival, Korboz speaks to them from inside the room and warns of a "shapechanger" in their midst. Korboz doesn't regain his senses until the characters assure him that the monster has been found and killed. Whether the mimic is truly killed or not, convincing Korboz that it's dead requires a successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

Korboz and Gnerkli are **rock gnome recluses**, each wearing a jagged metal crown and a patchwork cloak. Gnerkli is glued to a chair and restrained. Korboz carries a flask of solvent that dissolves the glue on contact. Their room contains all the trappings of a nicely appointed gnome bedroom.

***Treasure.*** A small unlocked chest under the gnomes' bed contains a *hat of wizardry* and a fully charged *wand of pyrotechnics*. Give the players the *Hat of Wizardry* and *Wand of Pyrotechnics* cards if their characters acquire and identify these magic items or they can reference them in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

# Icespire Hold
Icespire Hold is where adventurers can expect to find Cryovain if they haven't defeated the **young white dragon** elsewhere. This location is designed for characters of 6th level, though lower-level characters can defeat the dragon if they're cunning and cautious.

## Location Overview
Icespire Hold is a stone fortress perched on the icy northeast spur of Icespire Peak. A warlord named Delsendra Amzarr built the stronghold, and dwelled there for many years while she and her soldiers kept the orcs of the Sword Mountains in check. When supply lines were cut off by heavy snow and blizzards during a brutal winter, Delsendra and her followers starved to death. Orcs later took over the fortress, which was damaged by an earthquake ten years ago and never repaired.

When Cryovain decided to make Icespire Hold its lair, it stormed the fortress through the crumbled southwest section and ate several orcs before settling on the roof. With a terrible roar, the gorged dragon drove the remaining orcs out of Icespire Hold.

Recently, evil mercenaries calling themselves the Stone-Cold Reavers infiltrated the gatehouse and escaped Cryovain's notice. They assume (incorrectly) that the dragon has amassed a hoard and hidden it in the fortress. The next time the dragon flies off, they plan to steal it. They treat adventurers as they would any other competitors—either trying to scare them off or killing them.

> ##### Icespire Hold Features
>Icespire Hold is situated at an altitude of 2,500 feet and surrounded by sheer, icy cliffs. Other features of the location are summarized below.
>
>***Arrow Slits.*** When using an arrow slit for protection, a creature gains three-quarters cover (see *the rulebook*) against outside threats. A Medium character can't squeeze through an arrow slit, but a Small character can with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

>***Ceilings.*** Rooms and passageways in the gatehouse and fortress have 15-foot-high, arched ceilings. Ceilings in the undercroft are 8 feet high and flat.

>***Doors.*** Normal doors are made of wood fitted with rusty iron handles and hinges. Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. Finding a secret door requires a search of the wall and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

>***Light.*** Interior areas with no natural light to illuminate them are completely dark.

>***Temperature.*** The temperature is slightly above freezing during the day and plunges at night. Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates. On a failed saving throw, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and its speed is halved. The creature freezes to death if it suffers these effects for six consecutive hours. These effects end on the creature after it spends at least an hour in a place of warmth.

## Finding Icespire Hold
Icespire Hold is so tucked away in the mountains that few people know of its existence, let alone anything about its history or current state. Characters might learn of it after experiencing a vision at the *Shrine of Savras*, or they might search for it on their own. In the latter case, let the players use the poster map of the Sword Coast to plot a search. Icespire Hold is marked on the DM's map (below). Characters spot Icespire Hold if they come within 1 hex of it.

If the characters are ready to confront the dragon but need help finding its lair, use one of the following hooks to get them to Icespire Hold:

**Captured Orc**. A dozen **orcs** attack Phandalin. If the characters are not present during the attack, the townsfolk repel the orcs but suffer losses. One wounded orc is captured alive. This orc speaks Common and knows where the dragon's lair is. The characters can also capture an orc themselves and get the information they need from it.

**Tymora's Luck**. A sidekick or friendly NPC suggests that the characters pray for Tymora's blessing at the Shrine of Luck. If one or more characters do so, Tymora's blessing comes after a long rest when a mysterious, cloaked man arrives in town on a **riding horse** to gather supplies for his companions. The man's name is Dobin Noreth, a neutral evil member of the Stone-Cold Reavers (see the sidebar). Both he and the horse know the way to the dragon's lair, having come from there. Dobin's steed is a retired, well-behaved race horse named Four-Leaf Clover.

## Travel to Icespire Hold
Icespire Hold is more than 30 miles from Phandalin. En route to the dragon's lair, the characters have the following encounter.

### Frozen Ogre
Set the scene by reading the following boxed text aloud:

>>As you make your way across the cold, windblown foothills of the Sword Mountains, you happen upon a large, prone creature frozen in ice.
>>

The frozen creature is an **ogre** that the white dragon killed with its cold breath. The ogre's corpse was too big to carry off, so the dragon left it. A character who examines the scene closely and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check can ascertain that the ogre was killed within the past 24 hours. The cold of the foothills has kept the ice from thawing.

Frozen in the ice with the ogre is a hefty sack, but it can't be reached or searched until the characters chip or melt away the ice that covers it. The sack contains a rusty dwarven helm, two halves of a splintered wooden shield, a tumbleweed, a crumpled-up cowboy hat, and a sackcloth doll in desperate need of restitching.

***Treasure.*** If the characters are low on healing magic, they find three *potions of healing* in the ogre's sack along with the worthless items above. (Give the players three *Potions of Healing* cards or they can reference them in the [items.html#](Equipment Items Listing).)

## Arrival
As the characters approach Icespire Hold, read the following boxed text aloud to the players to set the scene:

>>Clouds partly obscure a stone fortress situated atop the icy spur of a jagged, snow-covered mountain that you recognize as Icespire Peak, a landmark so enormous as to be visible from Phandalin on a clear day. The mountain dwarfs the fortress, which consists of two separate structures joined together by a stone bridge. A narrow, winding path corkscrews up the mountainside to the smaller of the two structures, and appears to be the only safe way to reach it by land. It's an unwelcome path, but not as unwelcome as the cold, howling wind that buffets you.
>>

If Cryovain is alive, the **young white dragon** is sleeping on the rooftop of the main fortress (area H20), where it can enjoy the cold mountain air while surveying its domain from over the battlements. It sleeps in a 10-foot-square area in the middle of the roof, away from obstacles, and awakes if one of the following things occurs:

- The dragon is targeted by a spell or takes damage.
- Someone or something makes a noise loud enough to interrupt the dragon's slumber. Noises that qualify include the clap of a *thunderwave* spell, sounds of combat in areas not completely sealed off from the outside by doors, or a whisper in the dragon's ear.

If the dragon realizes intruders are near but can't determine their whereabouts, it lets out a roar and takes to the air. As it circles the fortress, it glances around for signs of intrusion. If it finds nothing to attack, it returns to the rooftop and waits for intruders to come to it. The dragon is small enough that it can squeeze through doorways and passageways, but it needs an incentive to enter the fortress because it dislikes confined spaces. Like most white dragons, Cryovain is slow-witted and easily baited.

The howling of the wind prevents Cryovain from hearing intruders who remain relatively quiet. The wind also silences the characters as they follow the icy path (area H1) that leads to and from the gatehouse (areas H2 through H6).

### Icespire Hold Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of Icespire Hold.

![[022-map-ih-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### H1. Narrow Trail
This narrow trail clings to the mountainside as it twists around and up to the gatehouse. Tracks from horses coming and going along the trail are clearly visible. Characters must traverse the trail in single file. If there's more than one character, determine their marching order and how far apart they're spaced in case it becomes relevant.

The trail is safe, though a 20-foot-long stretch of it is buried under rubble that is *difficult terrain* (see *the rulebook*).

***Reaching the Gatehouse.*** The trail ends at the outer door of the gatehouse. This door can be barred shut from within, but its heavy wooden crossbar isn't in place when the characters arrive. They must let themselves in, as no one answers the door if they knock.

The mercenary stationed in area H6 watches the trail and alerts her companions in area H4 if she sees strangers approaching the gatehouse. Careful not to wake the dragon, the mercenaries allow characters to enter the gatehouse unchallenged. See the "Stone-Cold Reavers" sidebar for more information about the mercenaries.

#### H2. Stables
Four saddled **riding horses** are kept in stalls. A fifth stall stands empty. The horses belong to the mercenaries in areas H4 and area H6.

#### H3. Storage
This room contains empty wooden barrels and crates that are so old and brittle they fall apart if disturbed.

> ##### Stone-Cold Reavers
>The Stone-Cold Reavers are neutral evil human **veterans** who speak Common. When they can't find work as sellswords, they resort to brigandry and thievery. After spotting the white dragon, they decided to follow it back to its lair. They're now waiting for it to go hunting so they can plunder Icespire Hold during its absence. Until the dragon leaves, the reavers do everything they can to avoid attracting its attention. If the characters killed the dragon elsewhere, assume that the mercenaries searched the fortress, found nothing, and are now angrily waiting for a companion named Dobin Noreth to return with supplies (see "Tymora's Luck").
>
>The Reavers threaten the characters with bodily harm to scare them away, turning to violence if their threats fall on deaf ears. If the characters try to bribe them, the mercenaries realize that it would be easier to rob the characters than accept the bribe. If two or more Reavers are killed or incapacitated, the others stand down and try to negotiate a truce to ensure their own survival.
>
>Characters encounter the following four Stone-Cold Reavers in Icespire Hold:
>
>**Syleen Wintermoon**. The leader of the Stone-Cold Reavers is a lean, brash woman who hails from Neverwinter and keeps her red hair pulled back in a ponytail. Syleen enjoys taking risks, living as though each day will be her last. She lies compulsively and always assumes she's being lied to.
>
>**Runa Vokdottir**. A muscular woman with black hair and cold blue eyes, Runa hails from Icewind Dale far to the north. A lifetime of sunless days and frigid nights falsely taught her that cruelty is natural, not evil. Runa speaks few words but is armed with a biting sense of humor.
>
>**Brakkis Elspaar**. An unshapely man whose best years are behind him, Brakkis is an opportunist who likes following orders, as it frees his mind to think about retirement and dogs—two topics he can't stop talking about.
>
>**Jabarl the Orc-Biter**. Jabarl is a rugged, sullen brute with a criminal past that never manages to catch up to him. He's good at scaring people, caving in skulls, and tending to the horses, around which he seems more at ease.
>

#### H4. Gatehouse Barracks
Wooden cots lie in broken heaps against the walls, leaving a clear space in the middle of the room where the Stone-Cold Reavers have laid out bedrolls and other gear. If warned that strangers are near, all the mercenaries greet the new arrivals in the open area between this room and the stables. If the characters reach this area without being spotted, Syleen Wintermoon sits on a stool and sings quietly to herself while sharpening a knife. Sleeping under threadbare blankets nearby are Brakkis Elspaar and Jabarl the Orc-Biter. See the "Stone-Cold Reavers" sidebar for more information on these ne'er-do-wells.

The mercenaries' supplies include enough water and rations to sustain four people for one day.

#### H5. Smithy
An anvil rests on the floor near a fireplace that hasn't been lit in years. To one side of the hearth is a bellows so old that it falls apart if handled. Scattered about the floor are rusty tools and old horseshoes.

#### H6. Barbican
Arrow slits look down on the trail that winds around the gatehouse, and an unlit fireplace stands to the south.

Runa Vokdottir (see the "Stone-Cold Reavers" sidebar) uses the arrow slits to watch the trail. If she sees strangers, Runa leaves the room and alerts her companions in area H4.

#### H7. Stone Bridge, Iron Bell
This solid stone bridge spans the 35-foot gap between the gatehouse and the main fortress, 50 feet above the trail that passes underneath it. The bridge is edged by 3-foot-high stone railings.

Mounted to the fortress wall north of the door to area H8 is an iron bell with a short, rusty chain dangling from it. Ringing the bell wakes the dragon in area H20. The door to area H8 stands ajar, its crossbar broken. Damage to the door suggests it was forced open at some point.

#### H8. Fortress Entrance
This short, empty corridor has arrow slits in the north and south walls.

#### H9. Outer Defenses
These cold, empty halls are hidden behind secret doors and have arrow slits along their outer walls. The orcs never entered or inhabited these areas.

#### H10. Rubble
Years ago, an earthquake caused two corners of the fortress to collapse into great piles of rubble. This rubble is *difficult terrain* (see *the rulebook*).

#### H11. Abandoned Guard Post
Between piles of rubble stands an empty hall with arrow slits lining the outer wall. Cryovain smashed through the east door to get inside but found nothing of interest here.

#### H12. Audience Chamber
Three **stirges** flutter anxiously about this cold and dismal hall. The stirges are thirsty for blood and heedlessly attack any warm-blooded creature that attempts to cross the room.

Shields, weapons, and tapestries once festooned the walls here, but orcs tore down and destroyed the decor. A dozen humanoid skeletons in rusty armor lie scattered amid the debris. (All died of hunger.) Painted on the stone floor is a 10-foot-diameter, shield-shaped crest that features a black tower being struck by a golden bolt of lightning—the emblem of the warlord Delsendra Amzarr.

***Secret Door.*** This room has two secret doors. The east secret door pushes open to reveal area H9. The west secret door pulls open to reveal a 3-foot-wide staircase descending 10 feet to area H21. Cryovain is too big to enter this staircase.

#### H13. Dining Room
Orcs destroyed everything in this room, going as far as to pull down a pair of chandeliers that once hung by chains from the ceiling. Smashed furnishings include a long wooden dining table and a dozen wooden chairs. Lying in the sooty fireplace is the stuffed and mounted head of a large white wolf with glassy blue eyes. The head once hung from hooks above the mantelpiece.

#### H14. Kitchen
The orcs trashed this room, destroying its furnishings and scattering debris everywhere. A cold breeze blows out of the twin fireplaces built into the south wall.

#### H15. Pantry
This room has been ransacked, leaving nothing but smashed shelves, broken barrels, torn sacks, and other detritus lying about. Amid the detritus, the characters find the skeletal remains of a male humanoid clad in a rusty breastplate. On the verge of starvation, this guard was killed trying to steal rations.

#### H16. Armory
Weapon racks that once stood against the north and south walls lie smashed on the floor amid the remains of wooden mannequins. Rusty hooks on the walls once held armor, shields, and helms.

#### H17. Warlord's Quarters
As her soldiers were dying from starvation, Delsendra Amzarr was forced to quell a revolt by a handful of followers. After slaying them, the warlord took her own life by drinking poison from a goblet. Skeletons scattered about the room testify to these events:

- Three humanoid skeletons in rusty suits of chain mail lie on the floor near rusty longswords.
- A fourth humanoid skeleton in rusty plate armor lies slumped in a chair that faces the fireplace. A steel goblet lies on the floor between the legs of the chair. (The orc war chief stole the dead warlord's greataxe, which the characters can find in area H19.)

In the middle of the room stands a sturdy oak table around which Delsendra and her officers would plan battles. Tiny, carved wooden figures of soldiers are strewn about, as are the torn-up remains of old maps.

***Secret Door.*** The secret door in the east wall pulls open to reveal a 3-foot-wide staircase that descends 10 feet to area H21. Cryovain is too big to enter this staircase.

#### H18. Orc Barracks
Orcs have long laired here, as evidenced by the filth in the room. The furnishings that were once here have all been burned in the fireplace. Characters can chart the dragon's rampage through the fortress by following a series of smashed doors up the stairwell to the east, and to areas H19 and H20.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search through the filth find a leather sack containing 450 cp and 182 sp, and a cracked spyglass worth 100 gp.

#### H19. Orc War Chief's Lair
Kra, the orc war chief, dwelled here until Cryovain ate him. All that remains of Kra is a severed right hand still clutching the haft of an elegant-looking nonmagical greataxe, which the war chief found in area H17. The room is decorated with the spoils of war, including impressive-looking furniture that was mostly destroyed when Cryovain attacked. Also heaped about the room are furs, antlers, the rotting heads of Kra's enemies (dwarves, humans, and rival orcs mostly), as well as other trophies.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the room find an ornate wooden chair missing one of its arms. Crafted by sea elves as a gift to their land-dwelling cousins, it has six branches of red coral worked into its design. The branches can be detached and are worth 25 gp each.

#### H20. Roof
If the characters haven't defeated Cryovain yet, the final encounter with the **young white dragon** occurs here as it stubbornly defends its new home. The rooftop is enclosed by a 3-foot-high battlement, except in the corners where the wall has collapsed. Cylindrical stone chimneys jut 5 feet above the rooftop but are too narrow for even Small characters to squeeze through. These chimneys connect to the fireplaces in areas area H12, area H13, area H14, and area H17.

***Slippery Ice.*** Slippery ice covers the rooftop. The ice is *difficult terrain* (see *the rulebook*). When a creature other than Cryovain moves on the ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.

#### H21. Undercroft
This empty room is deathly cold. Chiseled into the lintel above each door is the word "CRYPTS" in Common.

#### H22. Crypts
These rough-hewn passageways contain unmarked stone caskets in alcoves. Sealed within each casket are the bones, rusty armor, and rusty weapons of warriors who fell in battle under Delsendra Amzarr's command.

#### H23. Empty Crypt and Secret Exit
Of the five unmarked stone caskets in this tomb, four are empty. The middle casket contains a dismantled toboggan that takes 10 minutes to assemble. The toboggan was designed for barreling down the mountainside—a last-ditch escape route that was never used.

***One-Way Secret Door.*** The secret door in the south wall is designed so that it can be opened only from inside the room by pulling on a hidden handle. A *knock* spell or similar magic can open it from the outside. The door opens onto a ledge overlooking an icy mountain slope.

# Loggers' Camp
"Loggers' Camp" is balanced for characters of 3rd level, though characters of 2nd level can survive the perils of this quest if they are cautious and clever. Characters of 4th level or higher should have an easy time dealing with the threats to the camp.

## Location Overview
Years after the eruption of Mount Hotenow, the city of Neverwinter continues to rebuild itself after the destruction wrought by that event. Loggers have set up camps along the river that flows out of Neverwinter Wood, using the river to transport logs to the city.

One particular camp, located on the south side of the river, is run by a craven opportunist named Tibor Wester, the half-brother of Phandalin's townmaster, Harbin Wester. Tibor employs skilled loggers to find the best trees, chop them down, and haul them back to the camp to be sent downriver. He gets his supplies from Phandalin so that he doesn't have to pay the outlandish "devastation tax" that Neverwinter applies on essential goods. The challenge lies in getting the supplies safely through Neverwinter Wood, which is why Harbin uses adventurers to make deliveries.

Tibor has a bigger problem than supply lines, however. His loggers have drawn the ire of **anchorites of Talos**, who resent intrusions into their territory in Neverwinter Wood. The anchorites have hidden a totem in his camp that has attracted **ankhegs**. The burrowing monsters caught the loggers by surprise, killing all twelve of them. Tibor survived by locking himself in his office, where he intends to remain until someone rescues him.

### Quest Goals
To complete the Loggers' Camp Quest, the adventurers must deliver supplies to the camp and have Tibor Wester sign for them. Tibor's signature assures Harbin Wester that the supplies reached their intended destination.

## Preparations
The characters need to pick up the supplies for the loggers' camp before setting out. Harbin Wester has made the necessary arrangements with Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin. When the characters arrive to pick up the supplies, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Barthen tells you that his clerks have filled two crates with supplies as he hands you a sheet of parchment, upon which is written an inventory of the crates' contents: foodstuffs such as dried meat, blocks of cheese, and loaves of bread, as well as casks of ale and flasks of oil. The two heavy crates are loaded onto a two-wheeled cart pulled by an ox. "The ox's name is Vincent," says Barthen. "I'll expect to see him and the cart returned, thanks."
>>

The ox (use the **cow** stat block) is a reliable beast. Each full crate holds enough provisions to sustain twelve people for a month, as long as the supplies are supplemented with fish and fresh water from the camp.

If the characters tell Barthen that they intend to visit *Falcon's Hunting Lodge* on the way, Barthen suggests they buy a bottle of fine wine (10 gp) and give it to Falcon as a gift.

## Travel to the Camp
The characters can travel 24 miles in a day, and the loggers' camp is roughly 50 miles north of Phandalin. The characters will need to take a long rest near the halfway point in their journey. They can choose to camp in the woods or veer eastward and spend their long rest at Falcon's Hunting Lodge.

The party member with the highest Wisdom (Survival) modifier is the most qualified to navigate Neverwinter Wood. Use the map of the Sword Coast to chart the characters' progress through the forest. Whenever the characters enter a new hex on the map, have the navigator make a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. If the check succeeds, the party stays on course. If the check fails, the party gets back on course after wasting 1d4 miles of movement going in the wrong direction.

### A Boar-ing Encounter
Shortly after entering the woods, the characters have an encounter that is not what it seems. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>About sixty feet ahead of you, a wild boar stands in a small clearing. The boar glares at you suspiciously.
>>

The boar is actually a female **anchorite of Talos** in boar form. The anchorite, Drethna, attacks only in self-defense. If the characters circle around the boar or otherwise avoid a confrontation, they can continue on their way. If the boar is spared, it darts off to warn the anchorites at the *Woodland Manse* that strangers have entered the forest.

## Arrival
If the characters follow the river from *Falcon's Hunting Lodge*, they arrive from the east. If they come straight from Phandalin, they approach from the south. When they arrive, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>The logging camp spreads along the south shore of the river, where a dozen tents are arranged on a sandy beach. Near a dock stands a cabin with logs stacked under an awning. Older cabins close by have been torn down to leave only stone chimneys and foundations. A grim silence hangs over the camp, and you see no one around.
>>

The **ankhegs** hide underground and rely on their tremorsense to detect prey. They burst out of the ground in the squares marked "ankheg eruption" on the map when certain conditions are met, as described in areas L3 and area L6. If you're running this scenario for one character, only one ankheg can be encountered at a time.

### Camp Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of the loggers' camp.

![[024-map-lc-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### L1. Cabins on the Rocks
These cabins have been mostly torn down, but their ruins stand atop a 10-foot-high escarpment of rock that the ankhegs can't burrow through.

#### L2. Old Cabin and Chimney
All that remains of this cabin is a ruined fireplace whose chimney has mostly collapsed, and a stone foundation that the ankhegs can't burrow through.

***Totem.*** A character who searches the chimney finds a totem buried in its debris: thirteen tiny, androgynous stick figures dipped in pig's blood, inscribed with tiny lightning bolt symbols, and tied together in a bundle with hair. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check can discern that the totem's purpose is to bring ill fortune to all who reside near it. Destroying the totem causes any ankhegs that haven't attacked yet to lose interest in the camp and burrow away.

#### L3. Office and Tool Storage
This cabin has a wooden floor and is divided into two rooms. The larger room is cluttered with logging equipment (saws, leather harnesses for climbing trees, and so on). An **ankheg** is hidden under the floor. The first time a character crosses the room, the ankheg bursts through the floorboards in the square marked "ankheg eruption" and attacks.

Tibor Wester, a human **commoner**, has barricaded himself in the smaller office to the north. He has pushed his desk against the door and huddles atop it. When faced with any decision, Tibor makes the most cowardly, self-serving choice.

#### L4. River Dock
Rowboats and river barges can be moored here, though there are none present when the characters arrive.

#### L5. North Camp
A dead campfire is surrounded by six tents, each containing a bedroll and a mess kit. Further inspection reveals that the tents and bedrolls have been partially dissolved by some kind of acid spray. Footprints and strange marks in the sand suggest several humanoids were attacked here and dragged away. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check can deduce that the humanoids were killed and dragged down into the sand by burrowing monsters. Ankhegs collapse their tunnels behind them, leaving no way to follow them.

#### L6. South Camp
This camp is similar to area L5, but three **ankhegs** are hidden underneath it. When a creature steps within 20 feet of a square marked "ankheg eruption" on the map, a hostile ankheg bursts out of the ground in that square and fights until slain.

# Mountain's Toe Gold Mine
"Mountain's Toe Gold Mine" is designed for characters of 4th level, but characters of 3rd level can survive if they avoid unnecessary combat or possess a magic weapon. Characters of 5th level or higher will face less peril but should enjoy the roleplaying opportunities.

## Location Overview
The Mountain's Toe Gold Mine, owned by a business consortium in Neverwinter, has been troubled by recent productivity problems. The owners have hired a no-nonsense overseer named **Don-Jon Raskin** to sort things out. But neither Raskin nor the owners know that the troubled mine has recently been taken over by a band of wererats calling itself the Whiskered Gang.

### Quest Goals
To complete the Mountain's Toe Quest, the adventurers must escort **Don-Jon Raskin** safely to the mine. Once he sees that **wererats** have infested it, Raskin urges the characters to eradicate the "varmints." If the characters refuse, Raskin is left to negotiate a truce with the wererats on his own—and is quickly turned into one.

### Roleplaying Don-Jon Raskin
Full of bluster and stories of his great exploits, **Don-Jon Raskin** walks and talks like a giant. He has worked as a gold prospector, miner, fur trader, privateer, and whaler. He even ran a trading post on the outskirts of Neverwinter for a few seasons. If the characters take up the quest to escort Raskin to the Mountain's Toe Gold Mine, they'll find him staying at the Stonehill Inn in Phandalin. Townmaster Harbin Wester has an agreement with Raskin's employers to ensure the overseer reaches the mine safely.

If his employers didn't insist on providing an escort, Raskin would just as soon make the trip alone. That being said, he expects that young adventurers will delight in his recounting the tales of his exploits, and he secretly looks forward to the company.

## Travel to the Mine
The fastest way to reach the mine from Phandalin is to head northeast, skirting the foothills of the Sword Mountains. The mine is only 15 miles from Phandalin, so if the characters leave at dawn, they'll be there before sunset.

> ##### Mine Features
>All tunnels and caverns in the mine are hewn from rock that has thin veins of gold ore running through it. Other common features are described below.
>
>***Ceilings.*** Ceilings throughout are 8 feet high and braced at regular intervals by wooden pilasters and beams.

>***Doors.*** All doors are made of wood with iron hinges and handles. The doors are fitted with locks, but none of them are locked. The keys needed to unlock and lock them are gone—stolen by a previous overseer who fled the mine.

>***Light.*** Oil lanterns hang from ceiling hooks in every room and tunnel.

### Dead Orcs
When the party gets within five miles of the mine, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>A low ridge rises to your right, beyond which you see the Sword Mountains scrape the gray sky. But closer in, something is strewn across the rocky ground ninety feet ahead.
>>
>>"Well, ain't that something," says Don-Jon, pointing at what appear to be six dead orcs.
>>

The orcs were killed by Cryovain the white dragon. They are clad in hide armor, and their greataxes and javelins litter the ground around them. Any character who examines the corpses and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check can determine that extreme cold killed the orcs about three days ago. If the players can't piece together what happened, Don-Jon says, "Looks like a white dragon saved us from some trouble."

## Arrival
The characters arrive at the west entrance to the mine, which you can describe as follows:

>>Hidden among bushes, a tunnel burrows into the foot of a soaring, snow-capped mountain. Above the mouth of the tunnel is a wooden plank with the words "Mountain's Toe" carved into it in Common.
>>

Don-Jon doesn't have a map of the mine and has never visited it before, so he knows nothing about its layout.

### Mine Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of the Mountain's Toe Gold Mine.

![[026-map-mtgm-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### M1. Guard Post
This cave is guarded by two female **wererats** in hybrid form. They offer to escort new arrivals to the mine's overseer, Zeleen Varnaster, in area M4.

#### M2. Wooden Posts
Wooden posts used for shoring up tunnels and caves lean against the walls here.

#### M3. Crates and Casks
Stacked against the walls of this storage area are a dozen empty crates and a similar number of empty casks.

#### M4. Wererat Den
Scattered about this cave are pickaxes, shovels, and other mining tools. The northeast section contains four **giant rats**. The southwest section contains **wererats** in human form: one male wererat for each party member (including **Don-Jon Raskin** but not sidekicks) plus a female wererat named Zeleen Varnaster—the leader of the Whiskered Gang. If Zeleen dies, another wererat takes over as leader as long as any of them survive.

The wererats invaded the mine after orcs pushed them out of their previous lair—an old shrine near Conyberry (see "*Shrine of Savras*"). The wererats say they'll go back to their old lair if the characters get rid of the orcs at the shrine, but this is a only a ploy. The wererats have no intention of abandoning the mine.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the cave find two sacks hidden under debris. One sack contains ten fist-sized chunks of gold ore worth 10 gp each. The other holds 82 sp, 450 cp, and a pair of *goggles of night*. If the characters obtain and identify the goggles, give the *Goggles of Night* card to the players or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### M5. Storeroom
A dozen crates of dry foodstuffs and nine casks of drinking water are stacked in the middle of this cave.

#### M6. Sleeping Quarters
This cave contains a dozen wooden cots.

#### M7. Gold Storage
This cave contains two wheelbarrows and an empty bin.

#### M8. Equipment Storage
Picks, shovels, and wheelbarrows are stored here.

#### M9. Dead End
Leaning against the back wall of this tunnel is a dead human miner with a pickaxe. Inspection of the corpse reveals that the miner was stabbed to death.

#### M10. Overseer's Office
The wererats ransacked this cave, whose furnishings include a desk, a chair, an empty wooden chest, and a cot.

#### M11. Carrion Crawler
A **carrion crawler** lairs in this tunnel, the north end of which is 20 feet up the mountain's rocky slope. Characters can scale the slope with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. The crawler can't open the door at the south end of the tunnel, so it clings to the ceiling in the middle of the tunnel and attacks anyone who approaches from either direction.

#### M12. Sleeping Quarters
This cave holds six wooden cots.

#### M13. Rat-Infested Cave
This cave contains five **giant rats** that attack anyone who opens the doors to area M14.

#### M14–M15. Miners' Retreat
These caves are home to five hungry dwarf miners. They are **commoners** who speak Common and Dwarvish, and who have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. The miners refuse to surrender the mine to a bunch of "filthy rats." The wererats assume these miners will flee or die of starvation eventually.

#### M16. Graveyard
This field contains a ring of earthen graves with pickaxes sticking out of the ground where headstones ought to be. Buried here are ten miners who died fighting the wererats for control of the mine.
---
# Shrine of Savras
"Shrine of Savras" is balanced for characters of 1st to 6th level. This location is not connected to any quest, though one of the entries in the Phandalin Tales table might lure adventurers here. Characters might also visit the shrine after hearing of it from the wererats in the *Mountain's Toe Gold Mine*.

## Location Overview
Five miles south of Conyberry is a shrine dedicated to Savras, god of divination and fate. Many years ago, the shrine's priest-seers foresaw a barbarian attack on Conyberry, giving the townsfolk time to escape. Not all the townsfolk chose to flee, but those who did went to the shrine and brought much of the town's gold with them.

The barbarians eventually tracked the townsfolk to the shrine, besieged it, and slaughtered everyone inside. In the days leading up to this final battle, the priest-seers helped the townsfolk hide their gold in plain sight. They melted down the coins and recast them into a bell, which they painted and hung in the shrine's belfry (replacing the old iron bell). The gold bell hangs there to this day.

Over the years, many other creatures have occupied the shrine. Most recently, a gang of wererats laired here until they were driven out by orcs displaced by Cryovain the white dragon. Recently, ogres wandered by the shrine, saw the orcs, and decided to join them.

## Arrival
An old dirt trail stretches from the outskirts of Conyberry to the shrine, which characters first see from a distance. Read the following boxed text aloud:

>>A ruin stands in the middle of a vast field north of the rocky foothills of the Sword Mountains. An old stone temple with a belfry jutting from its peaked roof is enclosed by stone walls, many sections of which have collapsed. The trail ends at a crumbling gatehouse, the doors to which were sundered long ago. Three of the four towers that once stood at the corners of the outer walls have collapsed. Only the northeast tower remains, and a guard stands atop it.
>>

The guard spotted atop the northeast tower (area S6) is an **orc**. During the day, the characters can't approach the shrine without being seen by this sentry, as there are no places to hide in the level field surrounding the shrine. If the characters wait until nightfall, clouds obscure the moon and enable them to approach unseen, as long as they stay outside the 60-foot range of the orc's darkvision. If the orc spots the characters, it cries out, rousing the shrine's other occupants. Once roused, all those occupants attack.

The Enemy Roster table adjusts the number of **orcs** and **ogres** in the shrine based on the level of the characters and the number of characters in the party, not counting sidekicks.

##### Enemy Roster
| CharacterLevel | Number of Orcs and Ogres |
| 1st | 2 orcs per character plus 1 ogre in the courtyard (area S2), 1 orc atop the northeast tower (area S6) |
| 2nd–3rd | 3 orcs per character plus 2 ogres in the courtyard (area S2), 1 orc atop the northeast tower (area S6) |
| 4th–5th | 4 orcs per character plus 3 ogres in the courtyard (area S2), 1 orc atop the northeast tower (area S6) |
| 6th | 4 orcs per character plus 4 ogres in the courtyard (area S2), 1 orc atop the northeast tower (area S6) |

When rolling initiative for these foes, roll once for all the orcs and once for all the ogres.

### Shrine Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of the Shrine of Savras. Squares filled with rubble are *difficult terrain* (see *the rulebook*).

![[028-map-sos-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### S1. Gatehouse
The gatehouse is 20 feet high, and its outer doors have been smashed to flinders. A rusty iron portcullis blocks the south exit, but is bypassed by a rubble-filled hole in the southwest corner of the gatehouse. The winch to raise the portcullis has been destroyed, but the portcullis can be lifted manually with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check if desired.

#### S2. Courtyard
The orcs and ogres camp in this grassy courtyard, which is littered with bones, broken weapons, and shattered armor from past battles. The courtyard has four quadrants. The ogres claim the southeast quadrant, while the orcs claim the remaining quadrants. See the Enemy Roster table for the number of **orcs** and **ogres** present.

The courtyard's northwest and northeast quadrants contain rotted wooden troughs and posts that were once used to feed, water, and tether horses.

#### S3. Northwest Tower
This tower is open to the sky and strewn with rubble.

#### S4. Southwest Tower
This roofless tower has a rubble-filled break in its southeast wall.

#### S5. Southeast Tower
Little remains of this tower. Lying amid the debris is a rusty iron bell that weighs 500 pounds.

#### S6. Northeast Tower
This tower is the only one of the shrine's four towers that has not fallen. An iron ladder inside the tower climbs to a stone trapdoor in the ceiling, through which characters can reach the tower's battlemented rooftop. An **orc** watches the surrounding countryside from atop the tower.

#### S7. Main Hall and Belfry
Rows of crumbling pillars support the 40-foot-high vaulted ceiling of this hall. Humanoid bones litter the dusty floor, and a 10-foot-square hole in the ceiling leads to the belfry. No rope hangs from the bell, which appears to be made of untarnished copper. The belfry can be reached from outside by climbing the outer walls and rooftop, which requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Characters can reach the belfry from inside using magic such as a *spider climb* or *fly* spell.

***Treasure.*** Close examination of the bell reveals that it's thin sides are solid gold covered with peeling copper paint. The bell, which is 3 feet wide and weighs 50 pounds, hangs from an iron fixture bolted to a wooden crossbeam. A character with carpenter's tools or smith's tools can use them to detach the bell from the beam in 1 minute. Any creature under the bell when it falls must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity check to get out of the way, or take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. The gold bell is worth 2,500 gp.

#### S8. Visitors' Sanctuary
Guests of the shrine were housed here. Later, the wererats used this area as a lair. The room contains six beds with moldy mattresses, the shattered remains of a wooden table and six chairs, and a soot-stained fireplace containing a rusty cauldron hanging from a spit. A narrow break in the north wall provides an alternative exit.

#### S9. Priest-Seers' Sanctuary
The priest-seers of Savras slept and cooked their meals here. All the furnishings in this area have been destroyed, and part of the south wall has collapsed.

#### S10. Altar of Fate

>>Six stone pillars brace the vaulted ceiling of this temple, the floor of which is buried under a thick layer of dust. Also covered in dust are four humanoid skeletons in tattered priestly vestments, lying near a stone altar situated in an alcove under four narrow windows. Carved into the front of the altar is a humanoid eye.
>>

A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the altar. If Cryovain has been slain, nothing happens when a character touches the altar. Otherwise, any character touching the altar experiences a vision lasting 1 minute, during which time the character is incapacitated. In the vision, the character floats through the roof of the shrine, soars toward *Icespire Hold*, and sees the **white dragon** asleep on the fortress's rooftop. (The divination power of the altar is effectively telling the characters where they must go to defeat the dragon.) A character receives this vision only once. Nothing happens to a character who touches the altar a second time.

***Treasure.*** Any character who searches the altar and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check realizes that the altar's base doesn't quite touch the floor. The altar has stone rollers built into it and can be pushed 3 feet to the south, revealing an unlocked wooden coffer tucked inside a 1-foot-square cavity in the floor. This coffer contains 57 gp and a *mystery key*. If the characters acquire and identify the *mystery key*, give the players the *Mystery Key* card or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

# Tower of Storms
"Tower of Storms" is not connected to any quest, though one of the entries in the Phandalin Tales table might lure the adventurers here. This location is balanced for characters of 3rd level, but lower-level characters can survive if they're cautious and rest often.

Before running this location, review the *underwater combat rules* in *the rulebook*.

## Location Overview
The Tower of Storms is more than just a lighthouse—it's a temple dedicated to Talos, the evil god of storms. Moesko, the half-orc **anchorite** who guards the lighthouse, uses its pulsing beacon to draw ships to their doom, for the light acts as an irresistible lure to passing seafarers who sail too close to shore. The source of the beacon's eerie green light is Moesko's own heart, which was torn from his chest in a ritual. If the heart is destroyed, the beacon's light goes out.

The lighthouse is built atop a barren, 80-foot-high outcropping of rock. At low tide, a narrow causeway extends from the shore to this outcropping, allowing easy access to the lighthouse. This causeway is 5 feet above sea level at low tide. At high tide, the causeway and the sandy beach are submerged under 5 feet of water.

## Travel to the Lighthouse
The Tower of Storms stands along the coast roughly 35 miles west of Phandalin. If the characters leave Phandalin at dawn, they can reach the High Road by nightfall and spend a long rest camping nearby. As the characters travel west of the High Road the next day, they see a storm brewing out to sea. By the time they reach the 100-foot-high cliffs overlooking the lighthouse and the Sea of Swords, the thunderstorm has reached the coast.

## Arrival
The characters arrive at low tide, when the causeway leading to the lighthouse is above sea level. Describe the location to the players as follows:

>>Below the high cliff that hugs the coastline, an outcropping of rock is nearly surrounded by water, with only a narrow causeway connecting it to the beach below. Atop this outcropping is a stone building surmounted by a lighthouse tower. An eerie green light pulses from this beacon, shining westward out to sea. With each green pulse of light, you hear the thump of a slow-beating heart.
>>

Characters searching for a safe way down the cliffs discover a staircase carved into a narrow fissure. They can follow these steps all the way down to the shore just east of area T1. Crawling along the beach as they arrive there is a **giant crab**.

The giant crab waves its claws at the characters, who can interpret this behavior as a friendly gesture with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. A sea elf named Miraal used magic to imbue this creature with an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common. If the characters approach it peacefully, the crab says, "Well met!" and tries to strike up a conversation, during which it imparts the following information:

- "Evil harpies nest atop the rocky outcropping."
- "There are sharks in these waters, but the one to fear is a mean old brute named Daggermaw. She'll bite your head off and take pleasure in it."
- "Five shipwrecks are spread around the rock beneath the lighthouse. I'll fetch treasure from one of these wrecks if you help me."

#### Helping the Giant Crab
If the characters agree to help the giant crab, it asks them to lay to rest its dead sea elf master, Miraal, whose spirit haunts a nearby cave (area T1). If the characters do so, the crab thanks them and makes good on its promise, retrieving the *+1 weapon* from the wreck of the *Star-Crossed Lover* (see the Shipwrecks table).

### Tower of Storms Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of the Tower of Storms.

![[030-map-tos-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### T1. Haunted Cave
Rough-hewn steps climb a 7-foot-high tunnel that passes all the way through a 30-foot-tall natural pillar of rock. A damp, 8-foot-high cave encrusted with lichen is connected to this tunnel. The cave remains above sea level at high tide and is haunted by a **banshee**. The banshee, Miraal, manifests as a ghostly elf with gills, webbed hands, and webbed feet. It wears spectral garments that sway as though the undead is floating underwater. The banshee can't travel farther than 100 feet from this cave, and thus can't reach the lighthouse.

Miraal was a sea elf killed by Moesko, who took her spellcasting focus—an opalescent conch—as a trophy. The banshee demands that the characters retrieve the conch and bring it to the cave, which will set her spirit to rest. It tries to kill the characters if they refuse, pursuing them as far as it can if they flee.

#### T2. Plateau
Rough-hewn stairs climb the eastern face of the rocky outcropping. The **harpies** in area T5 accost the characters as they climb these steps. See area T5 for details.

At the top of the stairs, a rocky plateau spreads out some 80 feet above the water. Wooden doors leading to area T3 have rusty iron hinges and handles, as well as decorative lightning bolts carved into them. All other doors in the Tower of Storms are of similar construction and ornamentation. None of the doors are locked.

#### T3. Foyer
This 15-foot-high room is empty. Through a dirty window in the south wall, the characters can see two ships' masts jutting crookedly from the water.

#### T4. Shrine of Talos
Describe this location to the players as follows:

>>The walls of this fifteen-foot-high room are adorned with frescoes that depict ships being tossed on stormy seas, with a dark and terrible god looming above them and smiling. Set into the west wall is a dirty, salt-encrusted window. A stone altar with lightning bolts carved into it stands against the south wall. A metal rod descends from the ceiling above the altar, splitting in two before it embeds itself into the stone.
>>

The smiling figure depicted in the frescoes is the chaotic evil storm god Talos, who can be recognized with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check. Clerics of the Tempest domain succeed on the check automatically.

Through the window, the characters can see the broken masts of several sunken shipwrecks jutting up from the water.

***Altar.*** The lightning rod on the roof (area T8) channels electricity into the altar, which converts that raw elemental power into magical energy. The first character to touch the altar gains the Charm of the Storm, described below. Give that character's player the Charm of the Storm card.

***Charm of the Storm.*** You become charged with the power of the storm, to the extent that tiny sparks crackle in your eyes. You can cast the *lightning bolt* spell (3rd-level version) as an action. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.

Once the altar bestows this benefit, it can't do so again until it recharges. The altar recharges when the lightning rod on the roof (see area T8) is struck by three bolts of lightning from a storm and channels that energy down into the altar. Lightning from other sources doesn't count.

#### T5. Harpies' Aerie
A ledge enclosed by a 3-foot-high stone retaining wall serves as a nest for **harpies**. The harpies line their nest with rotting vegetation and the bones of previous meals, which they hunt up and down the coast. The number of harpies present equals the number of characters in the party, including sidekicks (maximum three harpies). A harpy reduced to 10 hit points or fewer tries to fly away on its next turn, hoping to live to fight another day.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search through the harpies' nest find a *potion of water breathing*. If the characters acquire this potion, give them the *Potion of Water Breathing* card or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### T6. Lighthouse Interior
A spiral staircase with an ornate stone railing climbs up the inside wall of this round stone tower. Each staircase landing is 20 feet higher than the one below it.

#### T7. Moesko the Anchorite
This 15-foot-high room has two north-facing windows. A barnacle-encrusted chair stands against the south wall. Sitting in the chair is Moesko, an **anchorite of Talos** clad in armor made from giant octopus hide. Resting in his lap is an opalescent conch he took from Miraal the sea elf (see area T1).

Beneath his armor, Moesko has a hole in his chest where his heart used to be. If his heart (located in area T9) has been destroyed, Moesko is dead and slumped in the chair. Otherwise, he's alive and demands that intruders leave the Tower of Storms at once or face his wrath. He attacks those who defy him, confident in his ability to defend the lighthouse.

If Moesko is killed but his heart has not yet been destroyed, his body reforms in 24 hours, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the heart.

***Treasure.*** Returning the opalescent conch to area T1 dismisses the banshee as its spirit is set free. The characters are then free to sell the conch. Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster offers 125 gp for it, or it can be sold for 250 gp in a city such as Neverwinter.

#### T8. Rooftop and Lightning Rod
From this vantage point, the characters can see the shattered masts of the five shipwrecks west of the lighthouse (areas T10 to T14). Enclosing the rooftop is a 1-foot-high stone wall with a 2-foot-high iron railing atop it. A similar railing circles the walkway of the lighthouse beacon (area T9), which is 20 feet above this area.

***Lightning Rod.*** A 10-foot-tall, wrought-iron lightning rod reaches toward the sky. During a thunderstorm, lightning strikes the rod at random intervals as determined by the DM, and is channeled through the roof to the altar in area T4. A creature that happens to be in contact with the lightning rod when it's struck by a bolt of lightning must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### T9. Moesko's Heart
The pinnacle of the lighthouse beacon is partly open to the elements and surrounded by a narrow walkway topped by an iron railing. Three open archways allow the beacon's pulsating green light to spill westward over the sea. This light is so bright that any character who dares look directly at it is blinded for 1 minute.

The light originates from Moesko's still-beating heart, which floats in the air 5 feet off the floor. The heart has been magically enlarged to ten times its normal size, and is considered a Small object with AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to psychic damage. The heart can't be moved. If reduced to 0 hit points, the heart's light goes out as the organ implodes and is destroyed, leaving no trace behind. Attacks made against the heart have disadvantage unless the attacker is immune to the blinded condition or the heart's light is blotted out (by throwing a blanket over it, for example).

> ##### Exploring the Wrecks
>West of the Tower of Storms are five sunken shipwrecks (areas T10 through T14), with only their masts visible. Characters intent on searching the ships for treasure will need darkvision or magical light sources to see, as the wrecks are submerged in murky, 20-foot-deep water.
>
>Characters atop the 80-foot-high lighthouse outcropping might try to climb down its slope to reach the water. The slope has abundant handholds but is wet, so that ascending or descending it requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. A character who fails the check slips and falls, landing in the water below and taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen.
>
>Three 15-foot-long **hunter sharks** glide among the wrecks. Daggermaw is the meanest and hungriest of the three, and it attacks characters without provocation after they finish searching two of the wrecks. If Daggermaw wounds a character, that character's blood in the water attracts the other two sharks, which join the fray on Daggermaw's next turn.
>

#### T10–T14. Shipwrecks
The crews aboard these five vessels perished when the beacon's evil light compelled them to crash into the rocky outcropping. Fish have picked clean their skeletal remains, which lie scattered throughout the doomed vessels. Three sharks patrol the wreckage (see the "Exploring the Wrecks" sidebar).

The Shipwrecks table below gives the name of each ship and the treasure that can be found within it. A character can spend an action searching the inside of a shipwreck. As part of that action, the character makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, finding the ship's treasure on a success. Once a ship's treasure is found, nothing else of value can be retrieved from that wreck.

If the item found is a locked chest, a character can use an action to search the wreck for the key to the chest, finding it with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Conversely, a character can pick the chest's sturdy lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

When a magic item is found and identified, give the players the corresponding magic item card or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing). In the case of the *+1 weapon* in area T10, choose from among the weapons available (*+1 battleaxe*, *+1 longbow*, *+1 mace*, or *+1 shortsword*). Only one *+1 weapon* can be found, so choose a weapon with which at least one party member has proficiency.

##### Shipwrecks
| Area | Ship Name | Treasure |
|:---:|---|---|
| T10 | *Star-Crossed Lover* | *+1 weapon* of your choice, found in the grip of a skeleton that used to be the ship's captain |
| T11 | *Sea Urchin* | Starfish clinging to a locked chest filled with straw, within which is packed a delicate, 9-inch-tall, blue quartz statuette of a mermaid (75 gp) |
| T12 | *Vainglory* | *Cloak of many fashions* worn by the skeleton of the ship's captain |
| T13 | *Golden Gull* | Locked chest containing 120 ep and six pearls (100 gp each) in a black silk pouch |
| T14 | *Orca* | Locked chest that holds a fully charged *wand of secrets* and a leather-bound spellbook that contains the wizard spells *blur*, *charm person*, *comprehend languages*, *hold person*, *mage armor*, *sleep*, and *spider climb* |

# Umbrage Hill
"Umbrage Hill" is balanced for characters of 3rd level or lower. Higher-level characters won't face great peril here, but they might need to visit this location to buy *potions of healing* from Adabra Gwynn.

## Location Overview
Umbrage Hill got its name after two feuding dwarf clans fought a pitched battle atop it. The cause of their umbrage is a tale lost to time, and only the cairns of the dead now remain. The stone windmill on the hill is a later addition, but is still more than a hundred years old.

Adabra Gwynn, a midwife and apothecary devoted to Chauntea (goddess of agriculture), resides here. A **manticore** driven out of the mountains by Cryovain the white dragon attacks the windmill shortly before the adventurers arrive. Read the following boxed text to set the scene:

>>Built on the slope of Umbrage Hill is an old stone windmill surrounded by an iron fence. A large winged monster with a spiky tail is trying to knock down the windmill's front door. A woman appears in a second-floor window, waves at you, and yells, "A little help?!"
>>

Adabra uses the **commoner** stat block. Characters can fight or negotiate with the manticore, which ceases its attack and flies away if given at least 25 gp in treasure or a few pounds of meat.

If it's not killed, the manticore could return with its mate to make more trouble in the future.

### Quest Goals
Adabra declines to return to Phandalin, but the characters can complete the Umbrage Hill Quest by asking her for a note for Harbin Wester confirming her safety. Adabra also gives her saviors one *potion of healing* for dealing with the manticore (see below).

### Umbrage Hill Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of Umbrage Hill.

![[032-map-uh-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### U1. Dwarven Cairns
Dwarves were buried under these rock piles, but their bones, armor, and weapons disintegrated long ago.

#### U2. Ruins of a House
A fireplace is all that remains of this old stone house.

#### U3–U5. Stone Windmill
Adabra uses the millstone on the ground floor (area U3) to grind herbs and other ingredients for poultices and potions. Her quarters are on the second floor (area U4). The third floor (area U5) is a loft where guests can stay.

***Treasure.*** Adabra sells *potions of healing* for 50 gp. Give a *Potion of Healing* card to any player whose character acquires one of these potions or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing). If you run out of cards, Adabra has no potions left to sell. (There are six cards included with the physical product).
---
# Woodland Manse
"Woodland Manse" is balanced for characters of 5th or 6th level, though characters of 3rd or 4th level can survive the challenges of this quest if they rest between encounters.

## Location Overview
Many years ago, a half-elf wizard interested in the exploration of ancient elven ruins built a stone house in Neverwinter Wood, not far from several ruins that piqued her interest. In the course of her explorations, the wizard disappeared, and the protective magical wards on her home expired. The house fell into disrepair, then eventually into ruin. Ivy has all but engulfed it in the years since.

Recently, a half-orc **anchorite of Talos** named Grannoc took over the ruined house and planted seeds at the bottom of its well. From these seeds, a malignant tree grew to fill the well and began spawning evil plant monsters called blights (see "Blights" in the *Creatures* chapter). The blights obey Grannoc, who uses them to defend his woodland manse and kill trespassers within the forest.

### Quest Goals
To complete the Woodland Manse Quest, the adventurers must eradicate the evil dwelling in and around the manse. Their reward awaits them at *Falcon's Hunting Lodge*.

## Arrival
Characters who come here from *Falcon's Hunting Lodge* arrive from the west. Those coming from the *Circle of Thunder* arrive from the north.

> ##### Woodland Manse Features
>The manse is a dilapidated stone villa enveloped in ivy. Its common features are described below.
>
>***Ceilings.*** Ceilings on the ground floor are 8 feet high and flat. Second-floor ceilings are 15 feet high and peaked, with wooden rafters crossing below them at a height of 10 feet.

>***Doors.*** Normal doors are made of wood, and are so rotted as to be soft and easily breakable (no ability check required). Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. A secret door can be found by a character who searches the surrounding wall and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

>***Ivy.*** The ivy enveloping the manse is poisonous and makes the walls difficult to climb. Scaling a wall requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature that comes into contact with ivy must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) poison damage.

>***Light.*** Most locations on the ground floor are dark, as the ivy blocks out the natural light except in areas that are open to the sky (such as the courtyard) or that have openings through which sunlight or moonlight can enter. Rooms and halls on the upper level are dimly lit by natural light that filters through holes in the roof.

>***Windows.*** Windows are 2½-foot wide, 5-foot-high apertures with wooden shutters but no glass. Those along the outside walls are covered with ivy, which must be cleared away before the shutters can be opened or closed.

Describe this location to the players by reading the following boxed text aloud:

>>Following a trail through the woods, you come to a foggy clearing, in the midst of which stands a crumbling two-story manse all but hidden beneath thorny ivy. The large house is set atop a six-foot-high stone foundation, and the main entrance has a balcony above it. Pumpkins grow wild in patches around the manse, with several wild boars feeding among them. The boars snort with contempt as you draw near.
>>

The trail heading north off the map leads to the *Circle of Thunder*. The trail heading west leads to *Falcon's Hunting Lodge*.

### Woodland Manse Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of the woodland manse.

![[034-map-wm-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### W1. Pumpkin Patches
Nine boars graze in the pumpkin patches—one per patch. Of these, six are actual **boars**. The other three are **anchorites of Talos** in boar form. The anchorites ignore the characters until they try to leave (see "Leaving the Manse"). If the characters attack a boar, it flees on its turn by darting into the nearby woods. If the characters attack an anchorite, all of the boars and anchorites retaliate. If you need to determine whether a boar is an anchorite or not, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, the boar is an anchorite in disguise.

***Pumpkins.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals a dim aura of transmutation magic around each pumpkin. As an action, a character can carve open a pumpkin to reveal six servings of seeds within. Any creature that eats a serving of pumpkin seeds as an action regains 1 hit point. If a creature eats more than five servings of pumpkin seeds in 1 hour, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1d4 hours.

#### W2. Portico and Balcony
Describe the main entrance of the manse as follows:

>>Stone steps climb to a portico with a stone balcony overhanging it at a height of ten feet. Vines wrap around the balcony's support pillars and its crumbling stone railing. The ground-floor entrance features a double door with a giant boar's head crudely carved into it. An unmarred double door stands closed on the balcony.
>>

A character can climb up to the balcony with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If another character assists, the check is made with advantage. Both sets of double doors are free of ivy and safe to open.

#### W3. Downstairs Hall
This undecorated hall features a creaky and moldy wooden staircase.

***Trapped Stairs.*** The staircase climbs 10 feet to area W14. Its upper half has been weakened to the extent that it collapses under 50 pounds or more of weight. A creature on the collapsing stairs must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling onto a bed of wooden spikes planted underneath the staircase. On a failed save, the creature lands on 1d6 wooden spikes, each one dealing 1d6 piercing damage.

#### W4. Parlor
The door to this parlor has been smashed to pieces. The room is strewn with broken furniture—the remains of chairs, side tables, and a wine cabinet. A moldy circular rug covers most of the stone floor.

#### W5. Dining Room
The walls are covered with crude drawings in blood that depict boars chasing stick-figure humanoids. A fireplace dominates the south side of the room, and a smashed wooden dining table lies in a heap in the eastern half of the room, surrounded by six broken chairs.

If the characters met the shapechanged **anchorite of Talos** on the way to the loggers' camp and let it get away (see "A Boar-ing Encounter"), small twig figures rest on the mantelpiece—one representing each party member (including sidekicks). These are **twig blights** that attack if they are touched or harmed.

***Treasure.*** Amid the ruined furnishings is a tarnished silver candelabrum worth 25 gp.

#### W6. Kitchen
Nature has run roughshod over this kitchen, whose furnishings are wholly decayed. The outside door was broken down years ago, and rats have chewed holes in the bottom of the door leading to the pantry (area W7).

#### W7. Pantry
Much of the roof above this chamber has collapsed, leaving debris scattered across the floor. Birds have made nests on the wooden shelves that line the north and south walls. Rats long ago devoured anything they could reach, and all other foodstuffs have rotted away.

#### W8. Courtyard
Describe this area to the players as follows:

>>Stone steps lead down to a flagstoned courtyard that has a pillared arcade to the east. Seven windows on the upper level overlook the courtyard, in the middle of which is a five-foot-wide stone well with thick vines erupting from it.
>>

If the orcs in area W18 have not yet been dealt with, add the following:

>>Guttural snorts and yells erupt from the southeast corner of the manse, signaling the presence of orcs nearby.
>>

Characters who understand the Orc language can overhear the orcs planning some sort of attack.

***Gulthias Tree.*** The well, which is 30 feet deep, contains a Gulthias tree, the roots of which extend deep underground. With little room to spread out, the tree has grown into a malformed column of twisted wood with narrow gaps between its curling branches.

Hidden in the shaft are a number of **vine blights**—one blight plus one additional blight for each member of the party, not including sidekicks (maximum five blights). The blights form a descending column, with the closest one 5 feet below the well's mouth. With their blindsight, they can sense intruders in the courtyard. However, they emerge to attack only when they or the Gulthias tree take damage, or when Grannoc (see area W10) commands them to do so. Once the blights are out of the shaft, a Medium or smaller character can climb down it, slipping between the branches of the tree with ease (no ability check needed).

The Gulthias tree is a Huge plant with blood for sap. It has AC 15, 250 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and no actions, reactions, or defenses. Like an ordinary tree, it's immobile. Unless it's completely uprooted, however, it regrows from its roots even if it's reduced to 0 hit points, regaining 1 hit point every 24 hours.

On any night when the moon is blood red, the Gulthias tree can spawn 2d6 **twig blights**, 1d6 **needle blights**, or 1d4 **vine blights**. These blights split from the tree and crawl out of the well, ready to do Grannoc's bidding.

***Sounding the Alarm.*** Any loud noise in the courtyard alerts the creatures in areas W10 and area W18. Roll initiative for these creatures and the vine blights in the well, and have them react as follows:

- Grannoc and the twig blights in area W10 investigate immediately. On their first turn, they enter the courtyard, whereupon Grannoc commands the vine blights to emerge from the well. Grannoc and the blights then use their actions to attack their nearest foes.
- The orcs in area W18 use their first turn to drop down into area W9. They barge through the door and join the battle on their second turn.

#### W9. Apprentices' Room
Describe this area to the players as follows:

>>This room was once a bedchamber, kitchen, and dining room rolled into one. Four beds stand along the south wall, with shuttered windows and nightstands between them. Against the west wall are four wardrobes and a cabinet full of plain dishware and cutlery. Four chairs surround a small dining table in the northeast corner, and a trestle table strewn with pots and cooking utensils stands near a blackened fireplace. All the furnishings are made of wood.
>>
>>The ceiling in the southwest corner of the room has collapsed, filling the area below with debris and leaving a jagged hole through which the room above is visible.
>>

The wizard who built the manse had four apprentices. When it became clear that the wizard wasn't coming back, the apprentices pillaged the library (area W11) and fled, taking their personal belongings with them.

Any loud noise in this area alerts the orcs in area W18. On their first turn, they drop down through the hole in the ceiling. On the following turn, they attack.

Adventurers can move tall furniture underneath the hole and climb up it to reach area W18 without having to make an ability check.

#### W10. Wizard's Laboratory
The door on the east side of this room has been smashed down, but any light from the courtyard isn't enough to illuminate the room. Characters with darkvision or a light source see the following:

>>What used to be some sort of laboratory lies in ruins, its furnishings broken and heaped against the walls. In the middle of the room, painted on the floor with mud, is a ten-foot-wide symbol depicting three lightning bolts joined at their tips.
>>

Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the symbol as that of Talos, the evil god of storms. A cleric with the Tempest domain succeeds on the check automatically.

If the characters manage to get this far without alerting Grannoc, they catch him performing a ritual:

>>Where the lightning bolts converge, a half-orc wearing hide armor performs an eerie dance while consuming the entrails of a dead possum. Standing around the half-orc are several small twig figures.
>>

The half-orc, Grannoc, is an **anchorite of Talos**. Under his command are a number of **twig blights**—three blights for each character in the party, not including sidekicks. Characters who watch Grannoc without alerting or interrupting him can determine that he's performing a ritual with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check. Grannoc hopes Talos will answer his prayers and rain destruction down upon Falcon's Hunting Lodge. Any interruption by the characters spoils the ritual and incurs Grannoc's wrath.

***Map.*** Grannoc has a map scrawled on the torn-off flap of a leather satchel. It shows Neverwinter Wood and marks the location of the *Circle of Thunder*.

#### W11. Library
This area extends through both floors of the house. Describe it to the players as follows:

>>This room has a ten-foot-high wooden balcony forming its upper level, reached by a wooden spiral staircase curling down to the flagstone floor. Tall, empty bookcases line the walls, their shelves mostly bowed and broken. On the lower level, east of two pillars, are four old desks with chairs tucked behind them. A few moldy books are scattered about.
>>

***Secret Door.*** One of the bookcases on the balcony conceals a secret door into area W12. Tugging on the bookcase causes it and the secret door to swing open.

***Treasure.*** The books found here are old texts written in Elvish that describe long-lost elven kingdoms and civilizations. They are too damaged to be worth anything. Additionally, one desk has a small book tucked under one of its back legs to level it off. The book is titled *Elvish Idioms*, and its pages have been cut out to conceal a tiny leather packet containing *dust of disappearance*. If the characters find the packet and identify the dust, give the players the *Dust of Disappearance* card or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### W12. Master Bedroom
A four-poster bed stands between two shuttered windows against the west wall. Other furnishings include a desk and chair against the north wall and an empty wardrobe against the east wall. A fireplace built into the south wall features an elegantly carved mantelpiece.

***Treasure.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic emanating from the fireplace mantel. Any character who searches it and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers that the mantelpiece is actually a lid concealing a long, hidden compartment. The wizard who built the manse hid her *staff of birdcalls* here. If the characters obtain and identify the staff, give the players the *Staff of Birdcalls* card or they can reference it in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### W13. Magic Item Vault
This room has been sealed for years behind its secret door. When the characters open the secret door, describe the room's features as follows:

>>Hanging on a hook on the far wall is a handsome cloak that billows softly as the door opens. Against the north wall sits a wooden chest with tiny clawed feet.
>>

The chest weighs 30 pounds and is magically locked. A *knock* spell unlocks it, or the chest can be smashed open. It's a Small object with AC 15, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

***Treasure.*** The garment hanging on the hook is a *cloak of billowing*, and the chest contains an *immovable rod* wrapped in a black cloth. If the characters acquire and identify these magic items, give the players the *Cloak of Billowing* and *Immovable Rod* cards  or they can reference them in the [items.html#](Magic Items Listing).

#### W14. Upstairs Hall
Describe this area to the players as follows:

>>The walls of this L-shaped hall are lined with closed doors and shuttered windows. Between them are hooks where decorations once hung. A fireplace along one wall has a large insectoid head mounted above it. Natural light enters through a hole in the roof at the east end of the hall. The floor beneath the collapsed roof is strewn with debris.
>>

The wooden staircase that leads downstairs is trapped (see area W3).

The head mounted above the fireplace is that of an **ankheg** (see "Ankheg" in the *Creatures* chapter for an illustration).

The hallway leading to area W12 is dark. **Stirges** hang from the rafters here—three stirges per party member, not including sidekicks (maximum twelve stirges). The hungry stirges attack any warm-blooded creature that enters the area.

#### W15. Bathroom
This room has a conical roof and an open window to the north, through which ivy grows. A cast-iron tub with clawed feet stands in the middle of the room. Next to the tub is a rusty iron water pump that still works, drawing water from a hot spring under the house.

#### W16. Slanted Rooftop
Sections of this wood-shingled roof have collapsed into area W7, leaving gaping holes. The westernmost 15-foot-square section of roof collapses if 50 pounds or more of weight is placed on it. Any creature standing on this section of the roof when it collapses must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall into area W7 below, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage on impact.

#### W17. Upper Arcade
This corridor is enclosed by two double doors and four open windows. Characters can easily sidestep the ivy growing in through the windows to the east. If the orcs in area W18 haven't been dispatched yet, the characters hear their raucous talk through the southern double door.

#### W18. Guest Room
This room has been claimed by hostile **orcs** in league with Grannoc. Four orcs are here, plus an additional orc for each character in the party, not including sidekicks. The orcs are sharpening their weapons in anticipation of an attack on *Falcon's Hunting Lodge*. The orcs have destroyed this room's once-fine furnishings, leaving nothing of value. A hole in the southwest corner of the floor leads to area W9 below.

## Leaving the Manse
When the characters finish exploring the manse, they are attacked as they make their exit. The attacking force consists of any **anchorites of Talos** and **boars** in area W1 that were not previously killed or forced to flee. In addition, **needle blights** emerge from the woods to join the battle—two blights for each character in the party, not including sidekicks.

## Counterattack!
The day after the characters attack the manse, dark clouds settle over Neverwinter Wood as the **anchorites of Talos** stage a counterattack against *Falcon's Hunting Lodge*. **Gorthok the Thunder Boar** smashes through the lodge's palisade, allowing twenty **orcs** to storm the lodge.

If the characters aren't present when the lodge is attacked, Falcon and his servants flee on Falcon's riding horse and make their way to Phandalin, surrendering the lodge to the orcs.

# Ending the Adventure
![[035-eta-01.png|right|300]]

The adventure can end in one of several ways. Ideally, it concludes with the defeat of Cryovain the white dragon, the completion of all the Phandalin quests, or both. By then, the characters should be 6th level. Give the players a chance to wrap up loose ends before declaring the adventure over. For example, the characters might need to return to Phandalin to collect an outstanding reward or notify townsfolk that the dragon has been dealt with. Armed with such good news, Townmaster Harbin Wester might plan a feast in the heroes' honor. What happens next is up to you.

If the worst happens and the characters die, their adventure is also over. You can let the players roll up new characters and pick up where their last ones left off, or you can also start over with new characters, tweaking quests as you see fit to surprise players who might be familiar with them.

You might also expand the adventure by inventing new quests and new locations. Another introductory product called the *D&D Starter Set* contains an adventure titled *Lost Mine of Phandelver*, which takes place in the same region as this adventure and is designed for characters of 1st through 5th level. You can add locations from that adventure to this one, giving your players and their characters even more places to explore.

Once you've exhausted all the content this adventure has to offer, you can run it again for different players, or you can find an adventure that takes the characters beyond 6th level. The "Where Next?" section below offers a few suggestions.

## Where Next?
If your players want to advance their characters beyond 6th level, they'll need the *Player's Handbook* to do so.

If you plan to run more D&D for your players, you'll also need the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, the *Monster Manual*, and new adventures. Many DMs like to create their own adventures. Others prefer to run published adventures like this one. You'll find fun, inexpensive adventures for characters of all levels and groups of all sizes in the DMs Guild ([http://www.dmsguild.com](www.dmsguild.com)). Wizards of the Coast also publishes hardcover books that contain stand-alone adventures that can entertain you and your players for months. You can run these adventures as written, or you can do what many experienced DMs do: use the parts you like, ignore the rest, and add a few surprises of your own. Here are brief descriptions of some of these published adventures, to help you choose the one that's right for you.

*Curse of Strahd* **(for levels 1–10)**. Eerie mist engulfs the adventurers and transports them to Barovia, a land of Gothic horror ruled by the vampire Strahd von Zarovich. To escape Barovia, the characters must confront and defeat the vampire in his terrifying castle.

*Hoard of the Dragon Queen* **(for levels 1–7)** and *The Rise of Tiamat* **(for levels 8–15)**. Tiamat, the Queen of Evil Dragons, is trapped in the Nine Hells—but not for long if her servants amass enough treasure to buy her freedom. This adventure is split across two books.

*Out of the Abyss* **(for levels 1–15)**. Trapped in a vast subterranean labyrinth called the Underdark, the characters must fight monsters and forge alliances to survive. Along the way, they encounter wandering demons that are spreading madness wherever they go.

*Princes of the Apocalypse* **(for levels 1–15)**. East of Phandalin lies the peaceful Dessarin Valley, where four evil elemental cults have gained a foothold. To protect the valley and its settlements, the characters must root out and destroy these cults and their leaders.

*Storm King's Thunder* **(for levels 1–10)**. Evil giants seek to conquer the Sword Coast. If the characters can find Hekaton the storm giant king, he can put an end to the giants' rampage, but a secret enemy stands in their way.

*Tomb of Annihilation* **(for levels 1–11)**. A trap-ridden tomb holds a device that is capturing and devouring the souls of the dead. To save these poor souls, the characters must cross a vast jungle, descend into the tomb, and defeat the horrors within.

*Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage* **(for levels 5–20)**. Beneath the city of Waterdeep lies the dungeon of Undermountain, ruled by the mad wizard Halaster Blackcloak. Many heroes enter, but few escape!

# Creatures
This section contains stat blocks and descriptions for the creatures that appear in *Dragon of Icespire Peak*.

## Creature Stat Blocks
A creature's stat block provides the essential information that you, as the DM, need to run the creature.

### Size
The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. This space is not a measure of the creature's physical dimensions. For example, a typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, but it controls a space that wide. If a Medium orc stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the orc lets them.

##### Size Categories
| Size | Space |
|:---:|---|
| Tiny | 2½ by 2½ ft. |
| Small | 5 by 5 ft. |
| Medium | 5 by 5 ft. |
| Large | 10 by 10 ft. |
| Huge | 15 by 15 ft. |

#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space
A creature can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than itself. When squeezing through such a space, the creature's speed is halved. While squeezing, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against it have advantage.

### Type
A creature's type speaks to its fundamental nature. The following types of creatures appear in this adventure.

- **Beasts**. Nonhumanoid creatures that, like real-world animals, are a normal part of the world's ecology.
- **Dragons**. Winged, reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power.
- **Elementals**. Creatures comprised of one or more of the fundamental elements of air, earth, fire, and water.
- **Giants**. Humanoid-like creatures that tower over humans and their kin.
- **Humanoids**. Bipedal peoples of the civilized and savage world, including humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings.
- **Monstrosities**. Frightening creatures that sometimes resemble beasts but that are often touched by magic and almost never benign.
- **Oozes**. Gelatinous creatures that generally have no fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean.
- **Plants**. Plant creatures, as opposed to ordinary plants, have some degree of sentience and mobility.
- **Undead**. Once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse.

#### Tags
A creature might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, a mimic has the monstrosity (shapechanger) type. These parenthetical tags provide an additional layer of categorization for certain creatures, but they have no bearing on how a creature is used in combat.

### Alignment
A creature's alignment reflects its disposition. Alignment indicates whether a creature leans toward law or chaos and good or evil, or whether a creature is neutral.

***Any Alignment.*** Some creatures, such as the veteran, can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the creature's alignment. Depending on the creature, its alignment entry might indicate a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil.

***Unaligned.*** Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don't have an alignment.

### Armor Class
A creature that wears armor or carries a shield has an AC that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a creature's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and any natural armor or supernatural resilience it might possess.

If a creature wears armor or carries a shield, the kind of armor it wears or shield it carries is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

### Hit Points
A creature usually dies or is destroyed when its hit points drop to 0. For more on *hit points*, see *the rulebook*.

### Speed
A creature's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on *speed*, see *the rulebook*.

All creatures have a walking speed; those that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. Many of the creatures herein have one or more additional movement modes.

***Burrow.*** A creature that has a burrowing speed can use all or part of its movement to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. It can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

***Climb.*** A creature that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The creature doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb.

***Fly.*** A creature that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. If the creature is incapacitated or knocked prone while flying, it falls unless it can hover.

***Swim.*** A creature that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.

### Ability Scores
Every creature has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. For more information on *ability scores* and how they're used in play, see *the rulebook*.

### Saving Throws
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are particularly adept at resisting certain kinds of effects.

### Skills
The Skills entry is reserved for creatures that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a perceptive and stealthy creature might have higher-than-normal bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Skills in a creature's stat block are shown with the total modifier—the creature's ability modifier plus its proficiency bonus. If a creature's stat block says "Stealth +6," roll a d20 and add 6 when the creature makes an ability check using Stealth.

#### Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies
Assume a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap out a creature's armor and weapons, you must decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment. See *the rulebook* for what happens when you use these items without proficiency.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities
Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions and other game effects. These immunities are also noted here.

### Senses
The Senses entry notes a creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the creature might have, such as the following senses.

***Blindsight.*** A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without having to rely on sight, within a specific radius.

***Darkvision.*** A creature with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The creature can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Tremorsense.*** A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs, have this special sense.

### Languages
The languages that a creature can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a creature can understand a language but not speak it, and this is noted in the entry.

### Challenge
An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a creature that has a challenge rating equal to their level without suffering any casualties. Creatures that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have challenge ratings lower than 1.

#### Experience Points (XP)
The number of experience points a creature is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the creature, and characters gain levels as they accumulate XP.

In *Dragon of Icespire Peak*, you don't need to track experience points, as characters advance in level by completing quests instead of accumulating XP.

### Traits
Traits are special features of the creature that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter.

### Actions
When a creature takes its action, it can choose from the options in the "Actions" section of its stat block. *The rulebook* describes other actions available to all creatures.

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks
The most common actions that a creature will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the "weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw.

***Hit.*** Any damage or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described here. As the DM, you can take average damage or roll the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented. For example, a monster might deal 4 (1d8) slashing damage with its longsword. That notation means you can have the monster deal 4 damage, or you can roll 1d8 to determine the damage.

### Reactions
If a creature can do something unusual with its reaction, that information is contained here. Most creatures don't have special reactions, in which case this section is absent. *Reactions* are explained in *the rulebook*.

### Limited Usage
Some special abilities—whether they are traits, actions, or reactions—have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

***X/Day.*** The notation "X/Day" means a special ability can be used a certain number of times and that a creature must finish a long rest to regain expended uses.

***Recharge X–Y.*** The notation "Recharge X–Y" means a creature can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the creature's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the creature regains the use of that special ability. The ability also recharges when the creature finishes a short or long rest.

## Creature Descriptions
The creatures that appear in the adventure are presented in this section in alphabetical order.

### Anchorite of Talos
These **religious recluses** are granted spellcasting power by Talos, the god of storms. Their human ancestors bred with orcs, and now all anchorites of Talos are half-orcs.

![[036-636960342199103296.png|right|300]]

### Ankheg
An **ankheg** resembles an enormous, many-legged insect that burrows underground while using its tremorsense to detect prey. When it detects movement above, it bursts from the ground and uses its mandibles to seize prey. From its maw, it secretes acidic enzymes that help dissolve a victim for easy swallowing. It can squirt these enzymes to take down foes beyond its reach.

![[037-636460582309128084.png|right|300]]

### Banshee
A **banshee** is the hateful spirit of a once-beautiful female elf. It appears as a luminous, wispy form that vaguely recalls its mortal features. A banshee's face is wreathed in a wild tangle of hair, and its body is clad in wispy rags that flutter and stream around it.

A banshee is forever bound to the place of its demise. It abhors mirrors, for it can't bear to see the horror of its undead existence.

![[038-636460867586552503.png|right|300]]

### Blights
Blights are malevolent, supernatural plant monsters that try to spread evil wherever they can. Three kinds of blights are described here.

![[039-blights-v3-corrected-foot.png|right|300]]

#### Needle Blight
In the shadows of a forest, **needle blights** might be mistaken at a distance for shuffling, hunched humanoids. Up close, these creatures reveal themselves as horrid plants whose conifer-like needles grow across their bodies in quivering clumps. A needle blight lashes out with these needles or launches them as an aerial assault that can punch through armor and flesh.

#### Twig Blight
**Twig blights** can root in soil and resemble woody shrubs while rooted. When it pulls its roots free of the ground to move, a twig blight's branches twist together to form a humanoid-looking body with a head and limbs. Given how dry they are, twig blights are particularly susceptible to fire.

#### Vine Blights
Appearing as masses of slithering creepers, **vine blights** can animate the plants around them, using these plants to entangle foes. Vine blights are the only blights capable of speech, which they use to taunt victims or bargain with powerful foes.

### Boar
**Boars** are dim-witted omnivores that avoid combat unless they are particularly hungry or ornery. A boar attacks by charging and goring enemies with its tusks.

### Carrion Crawler
**Carrion crawlers** are large subterranean predators and scavengers that scour putrid flesh from carcasses and gobble the slimy bones that remain. They aggressively attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or disturbs their feasting.

![[040-636460892787682128.png|right|300]]

### Centaur
Reclusive wanderers and omen-readers of the wild, **centaurs** avoid conflict but fight fiercely when pressed. They roam the vast wilderness, keeping far from borders, laws, and the company of other creatures.

![[041-636460662223625909.png|right|300]]

### Commoner
**Commoners** include peasants, serfs, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.

### Cow
Use the **cow** stat block to represent common varieties of cattle, including oxen.

### Don-Jon Raskin
Adventurers who undertake the Mountain's Toe Quest meet **Don-Jon Raskin**, a fearless troubleshooter who has experienced more than his fair share of adventures.

![[042-636960517654418879.png|right|300]]

### Falcon the Hunter
Adventurers encounter **Falcon the Hunter** if they visit his *hunting lodge* in Neverwinter Wood.

![[043-636960516130812600.png|right|300]]

### Ghoul
**Ghouls** roam in packs, driven by an insatiable hunger for humanoid flesh. They thrive in places rank with decay and death. If they can't gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs, they pursue living creatures and attempt to make corpses of them.

![[044-ghoul.png|right|300]]

### Giant Crab
A **giant crab** weighs as much as an average adult human. Protected by a thick shell, it attacks with its pincer claws.

### Giant Rat
**Giant rats** roam in packs through sewers, caves, and other dank places. They are often found in the company of wererats (see page 64).

### Giant Spider
To snare its prey, a **giant spider** spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.

![[045-636460723371288078.png|right|300]]

### Gorthok the Thunder Boar
**Gorthok** is a primal nature spirit that takes the form of a boar as big as an elephant, with lightning that dances along its tusks. Gorthok serves the will of Talos, god of storms, and can be summoned during stormy weather to do the bidding of Talos's evil followers. Like its patron deity, Gorthok revels in destruction.

![[046-636960495200331563.png|right|300]]

### Harpy
A **harpy** is always on the hunt for prey. Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill and then consume.

![[047-636460790974137538.png|right|300]]

### Hunter Shark
A fully grown **hunter shark** is 15 to 20 feet long.

### Invisible Stalker
An **invisible stalker** is a remorseless creature of elemental air. It's naturally invisible, hence its name.

### Manticore
**Manticores** are fierce killers that hunt far and wide for prey. They aren't particularly bright but can converse with intelligent prey. If a manticore sees an advantage to be gained by sparing a creature's life, it does so, asking for a tribute or sacrifice equal to the loss of food.

![[048-636460819451261614.png|right|300]]

### Mimic
**Mimics** are shapeshifting predators that can alter their outward texture to resemble wood, stone, and other basic materials. They do so to assume the appearance of inanimate objects that other creatures are likely to come into contact with. A mimic in its altered form is nearly unrecognizable until it sprouts pseudopods and attacks.

![[049-636460814187935933.png|right|300]]

### Ochre Jelly
**Ochre jellies** are yellowish blobs that can slip through narrow cracks in pursuit of creatures to devour. Their digestive enzymes dissolve flesh quickly but have no effect on other substances such as bone, wood, or metal.

![[050-636460820040081881.png|right|300]]

### Ogre
**Ogres** are as lazy of mind as they are strong of body. They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands 9 to 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.

![[051-636460821919719183.png|right|300]]

### Orc
**Orcs** are savage raiders with an unmatched lust for carnage. They worship a pantheon of evil gods, the mightiest being Gruumsh. While they regard dwarves as natural enemies, orcs hate elves above all, for the elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's eye. Since then, orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves.

![[052-636460824964500193.png|right|300]]

### Riding Horse
A character can purchase or sell a healthy **riding horse** in Phandalin for 75 gp.

### Rock Gnome Recluse
**Rock gnome recluses** are skilled in the arcane arts. They use their magical talents to create all kinds of wondrous inventions, very few of which work as intended.

### Stirge
**Stirges** attach to living creatures and drain their blood. Packs of them can be a formidable threat, reattaching as quickly as their weakening prey can pluck them off.

![[053-636460847348942387.png|right|300]]

### Veteran
**Veterans** include soldiers retired from military service and warriors who never served anyone but themselves.

### Will-o'-Wisp
**Will-o'-wisps** haunt lonely places and battlefields, where they feed on fear and despair. They look like wispy, bobbing lantern lights in the distance.

### Wererat
**Wererats** are cunning lycanthropes that operate much like a thieves' guild. Through its bite, a wererat can pass along the curse of lycanthropy—something it normally reserves for new gang recruits. A player character cursed with wererat lycanthropy becomes an NPC under the DM's control on nights of the full moon.

#### Wererat Lycanthropy
Any humanoid creature cursed with wererat lycanthropy retains its statistics except as follows:

- The creature gains the wererat's speed in rat form, as well as the wererat's damage immunities, traits, and actions that don't involve equipment. It can't speak while in rat form.
- The creature gains a Dexterity of 15 if its score isn't already higher.
- The creature is proficient with the wererat's bite attack. Attack and damage rolls for its bite are based on the creature's Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher. The save DC for the creature's bite is 8 + the creature's proficiency bonus + the creature's Constitution modifier.

### Young White Dragon
**White dragons** prefer cold climates. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed. Their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among dragonkind.

![[054-636460866443987084.png|right|300]]

# Sidekicks
On your adventures, the DM might reveal that you've befriended a special character called a sidekick, who joins your party. This appendix presents the game statistics for sidekicks, of which there are three types:

**Expert**, an agile and exceedingly helpful jack of all trades

**Spellcaster**, a magic-user who can cast spells to harm your foes or heal you and your friends

**Warrior**, a martial companion who specializes in striking your foes or defending you and your allies

The DM will either tell you which type of sidekick to use or let you choose one. It's up to you and the DM to decide who controls the sidekick in play.
