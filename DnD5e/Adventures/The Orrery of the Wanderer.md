# The Orrery of the Wanderer
![[039-04-01.png|right|300]]

This chapter presents a complete Acquisitions Incorporated adventure divided into six episodes. Episode 1 is for players using shiny new 1st-level characters. They're ready to take on the world and hoping to become part-owners of a share in a valuable, prestigious Acquisitions Incorporated franchise—or at least gain a coveted internship with the organization.

At the end of each episode, characters gain a level. Each episode is an appropriate challenge for a party of four characters of the indicated level, but that challenge can be modified to accommodate your group. At the end of the sixth and final episode, the characters attain 7th level. But even more importantly, they will be fully vested in an operational and maybe even profitable Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. After that, the players and characters can take their treasure-hunting activities in any direction that you and they desire.

Between episodes, characters will use downtime to undertake a variety of activities to better themselves or their franchise. By later episodes, choices of downtime activities might alter the flow and challenge of the story. After all, there's no rest for the wicked, so there shouldn't be rest for heroes either. (Logically then, wicked heroes would need to work twice as hard. Budget the time.) Familiarize yourself with the new activities presented in "*Franchise Tasks and Downtime*" in chapter 2 of this book, and with the standard D&D downtime activities discussed in that section.

The *Monster Manual* contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are included there or in *appendix B*. When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block in the *Monster Manual* or the monster appendix in this book.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, except for the *Orrery of the Wanderer* and its components, described in *appendix D*.

> ##### No Players Allowed
>This part of the book is for the DM only. If you're planning to run through the adventure as a player, stop reading now! Unless you want to keep going, that is. Because seriously, it's not like anyone's going to stop you. After all, information is power—in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, and in life. Maybe you having a bit of an inside track is just what this adventure needs to make it really pop, and to keep the DM from getting all, "Ooh, look at me! I'm the one with the secrets!" I mean, can you believe how smug they are? It's like they're just begging you to turn the page...

## Running an Acquisitions Incorporated Campaign
The grand buffet that is an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign features plenty of the exciting locations and high adventure common to all great fantasy campaigns. But an Acq Inc game adds a unique helping of humor and corporate intrigue to the mix, creating a rich narrative familiar to anyone who's watched an Acquisitions Incorporated livestream game. To take full advantage of the potential of an Acq Inc campaign, keep the following concepts in mind.

### Familiar Faces
This campaign provides many NPCs for you to do with as you please. They all have roles to play in the encounters and events of the adventure, but what happens to them after that is up to you. Every NPC could be a potential ally, enemy, or foil later in the campaign. If the players take a shine to one, bring that character back—or better yet, make the NPC an integral part of the ongoing plot. All franchises need servants and hirelings to do mundane jobs, and NPCs the characters already know are a great fit for these roles. Employ these NPCs to make the world feel more familiar and real to the players and characters alike.

### Right and Wrong
Even the most heroic heroes sometimes fall short. And in many cases, adventurers aren't even within longbow range of "virtuous" in their motivations. As such, what the characters fail to do, do poorly, or do wrongly can be just as important as what they accomplish. Don't let failure and setbacks derail an adventure or a campaign. Rather, look for ways that failure or partial success might lead to new ways to reach a campaign goal.

You might be absolutely confident that the characters will save those townsfolk and earn their trust, letting you use the townsfolk to reveal an important quest goal. But if the town burns down despite the heroes' best intentions—or because they had better things to do—let them be mistaken for local authorities come to lend a hand in the aftermath. Or let them be unexpectedly arrested after being mistaken for the evil forces that burned the town down, and given the dangerous quest out of animosity. Humor plays a big part in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so make use of unheroic irony whenever the players and characters provide it.

> ##### Adjusting the Adventure
>Wow. Can you believe the advice your players are getting in that sidebar on the last page? And after all the time you're going to put in getting ready to run this adventure? Outrageous! Someone needs to teach these people a lesson.
>
>If you're running the adventure for larger or smaller groups, you can adjust the encounters using the guidelines given in chapter 3, "*Creating Adventures*," in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Or maybe you'll adjust them anyway to keep things interesting. And never forget that you can change up any aspects of the adventure to make them a better fit for your campaign. Swap monsters around to keep the players guessing, or make use of the adventure's many suggestions for side treks and additional encounters. That'll keep these so-called heroes in line.
>

### Life Goes On
By its most basic nature, a roleplaying game campaign focuses on the actions of the characters. However, it's important to remember that the world goes on without them. The heroes can't be everywhere at once. If they establish a base in one town but spend a lot of time away, anything could happen to that base. Hirelings might grow disenchanted in the characters' service if abused, neglected, or left to their own devices for too long. Ramp up the drama and the humor of a campaign by occasionally focusing on what the characters neglected or left behind.

### Let the Franchise Shine
An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is like a newborn baby that the characters all had a hand in conceiving, delivering, and raising. It needs constant care and feeding as it grows to its full potential, but there'll be a lot of risks, drama, and dirty diapers along the way. (Okay, that might be taking the analogy too far, but you get the idea.) Running a franchise can be difficult, but the potential rewards for the characters are tremendous. And for the players, making the franchise the focal point of the campaign provides a joint goal and a shared vessel of creative input.

## Story Overview
This adventure touches on a number of classic tropes in its setup and execution. Artifact of incalculable power accidentally stumbled upon? Check. Evil faction with plans to end the world? Got it. But even against potentially world-shattering events and plots, an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is always centered around humble characters making choices—including one unfortunate NPC whose choices have set the adventure in motion.

A year ago, a group of adventurers led by a dwarf named Caerhan Coalsmith found a strange object buried in the remains of a ruined tower. The relic appeared to be a golden orrery housing, missing its geared clockwork components. It was obviously a magic item of some kind, but arcane lore wasn't the party's strong suit, so the orrery was set aside while Caerhan investigated its provenance and history.

The dwarf heard a few tales about devices that matched the relic's description. Though he never learned the full scope of its powers, rumors told of how those powers would increase if a magic orrery's missing components were collected and placed within it. Unfortunately, Caerhan also never learned about the curse the orrery carried—and his party paid the price.

As an artifact, the *Orrery of the Wanderer* comes with a random major detrimental property (see the "*Artifacts*" section in chapter 7 of the **Dungeon Master's Guide*)*. The specifics of that property when the orrery housing was found are left up to you, but whatever it was (compulsion to evil for someone in the party, hostile life force, imprisoned death slaad, yadda yadda), Caerhan returned from a research trip to Candlekeep to find his fellow party members all dead.

Recognizing too late that the orrery housing channeled dark power, the grieving Caerhan decided that the relic must be destroyed. However, its artifact-level magic made it seemingly impervious to harm. More research was undertaken with the help of Caerhan's goblin sidekick, Gorkoh. In the end, Caerhan concluded that the best place to ensure the orrery's end was a secret shrine to destruction beneath Waterdeep, rumored to be able to destroy even powerful magic relics. So the pair packed up and headed for the City of Splendors.

The veteran dwarf adventurer located the underground tunnels leading to the shrine easily enough. He and Gorkoh braved those dangerous passages, but were separated during an encounter with a carrion crawler. Caerhan pressed on. But when he activated the shrine, he caused a minor earthquake that opened a sinkhole in Waterdeep's Dock Ward, and which cracked walls and sidewalks across the city. In the end, the orrery housing was too strong even for the destructive power of the shrine, and Caerhan died during his heroic attempt to rid the world of the dangerous device. Now, the orrery waits for someone else to take possession of it.

As the characters will learn in time, the orrery and its components were intentionally scattered long ago. But the pieces of the orrery maintain a connection, and have been steadily making their way toward each other for years. With one piece permanently held by the orrery's creator in the Greypeak Mountains, the other components and the orrery housing have ended up scattered across the Sword Coast, falling into the hands of different adventuring groups. One of those groups is the evil faction known as the Six, whose members have become aware of the orrery's existence—and have a full understanding of its potential for destructive power. That power is described in the orrery write-up in *appendix D*.

As the characters are drawn into contact with the orrery, they discover that two of the artifact's components have been claimed by Acquisitions Incorporated franchises that have come under recent attack by unknown foes. The rival faction of Dran Enterprises becomes a prime suspect, with its agents found on the scene for both attacks. And all the while, the shadowy members of the Six pull together a tangled plot to gain control of the orrery to destroy Acquisitions Incorporated—and bring ruin to Faerûn.

As the adventure unfolds, the characters travel hither and yon across the Sword Coast and the North, checking in on some classic adventure locations and exploring a number of brand-new sites. Map 1.1 shows the sites and locations featured in "The Orrery of the Wanderer."

# Episode 1: Right Place, Wrong Heroes
In episode 1 of the adventure, a case of mistaken identity gives the characters a rare opportunity to make a name for themselves in Acquisitions Incorporated. Their assigned task is to investigate a sinkhole fissure that opened up in Waterdeep after a small earthquake struck the city—the side effect of Caerhan Coalsmith's failed attempt to destroy the *Orrery of the Wanderer*. If the characters can conclude the investigation successfully, Acquisitions Incorporated CEO Omin Dran presents them with a unique chance to rise within the ranks of the organization.

> ##### Life in Waterdeep
>Before diving headlong into the events of "The Orrery of the Wanderer" campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep. The adventure *Waterdeep: Dragon Heist* and the "Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion" section of that book (available at the DMs Guild as a separate download—[http://www.dmsguild.com](www.dmsguild.com)) provide a ton of information about the City of Splendors.
>
>Additionally, you can make use of the following rumors that characters might hear on the streets or in the taverns of that great metropolis. Some of these rumors tie to the adventure, while the truth of others depends on your wishes for the campaign. Either way, feel free to use these rumors as inspiration for new encounters or side treks.
>
>- Omin Dran is one of the fabled Masked Lords of Waterdeep. His presence on the council is the impetus for beneficial changes sweeping across the city.
>- Omin Dran is definitely not one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. The addition to the council of such a power-hungry and ruthless individual would spell the end of the rule of law in the City of Splendors.
>- The earthquake that hit the city two days ago wasn't natural. Strong magic unleashed underground caused it—maybe even magic from Undermountain.
>- Acquisitions Incorporated is making a play for control in the city, and the other power groups of Waterdeep are not going to let that happen without a fight. The recent hostilities between groups such as the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim have been made even worse by the increasing sway of the company.
>- A noble merchant in the South Ward survived an assassination attempt last night. A female half-elf was seen fleeing the scene, bearing a deep cut on her shoulder from a bodyguard's blade. A 50 gp bounty has been offered for bringing her in alive for questioning.
>- A killer is stalking the streets of the North Ward, murdering people in broad daylight. The victims' feet are chopped off, as if by a powerful blow with a sharp blade. Then they're decapitated. The heads are left behind, but the feet are taken!
>- The famous Waterdavian actor Tystanya Creed has not been seen since leaving the theatre after her last performance several days ago. Her adoring fans fear she is dead.
>- Towering forms in black cloaks have been seen around the City of the Dead at night. A number of witnesses swear that those cloaks and their deep hoods concealed skeletal forms.
>- A green dragon was spotted flying over the Sea of Swords just west of the city. The Blackstaff and her team are on high alert in case it ventures closer or harasses ships in the area.
>- One of the great walking statues of Waterdeep has been reported to be crying over the last three days. No one is sure about the cause of this watery discharge from the eyes, but some say it means the destruction of the City of Splendors is imminent! Others are certain it's a sign of great fortune on the horizon. Still others say it's just the humidity.
>- Members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters are going on strike, leaving the streets of Waterdeep dark and dangerous around the next new moon. The thieves and assassins of the city are already getting prepared for a night of carnage.

## A Disorienting Orientation
The adventure begins with the characters seeking franchise opportunities or internships at the Waterdeep offices of Acquisitions Incorporated. All the characters should know the popular tales of that well-known organization and might have ties to Acq Inc (especially characters with one of the *backgrounds* from *chapter 3*).

*Sure, I get it. Your first time meeting Omin Dran can be intimidating. But just remember, under all that armor is a merciless psychopath infused with the power of a god.*— Jim DarkmagicFor a nervously long length of time, the characters are kept waiting in a conference room at Head Office. Read or paraphrase the following to begin:

>>Your inquiries into internships and franchise opportunities at Acquisitions Incorporated have gone even better than you'd hoped. Ridiculous rumors talk about how prospective interns of Acq Inc aren't always treated with respect, dignity, or care. Even more ridiculous tales of interns dying at an alarming rate are told throughout the city. Thankfully, you don't believe a word of any of that.
>>
>>So far, everyone at Head Office has treated you with kindness, and even a bit of deference. You were shown into this elegant conference room, given fine food and drink, and asked to wait to speak with none other than Omin Dran—founder and CEO of this august organization.
>>

If the characters already know each other, they were ushered into the conference room as a group. If they came to Head Office separately, they were each brought in alone and asked to wait with the others, and have a chance to introduce themselves before Omin appears.

>>It isn't long before the door to the conference room opens, and an intense-looking half-elf in plate armor enters. He wears a holy symbol of Tymora, the goddess of fortune, around his neck. It's Omin Dran! With no introduction, the CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated speaks.
>>
>>"Thank you for answering my call so quickly. When the earthquake struck the city two days ago, damage was limited, but a sinkhole opened up a fissure beneath an abandoned warehouse in Dock Ward. Two City Watch guards entered the fissure to investigate, but never came out. They're now feared dead, and the City Watch has asked me to take over the investigation. But my schedule is complicated at the moment, so I'm delegating that job to you. As an experienced adventuring group, I have no doubt that you can handle the task."
>>
>>Before you have any chance to respond, Omin drops a hefty bag of coins onto the table. "The pay is 500 gold dragons for the group, with a 20 percent commission going to Acquisitions Incorporated as the broker. Go to the warehouse next to Jolly's Lamp Emporium down by the docks. Tell the City Watch guards stationed there that I sent you. Explore the fissure, learn the fate of the guards who went missing, and then come back to me with the signed City Watch papers confirming your completed work."
>>
>>Then without another word, Omin Dran turns and leaves the room.
>>

Through a crazy and never-to-be-explained misunderstanding, Omin believes that the characters are a group of experienced adventurers that he put out a call for just the day before. If the characters attempt to correct this misunderstanding, he ignores them. The CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated has important business to deal with, and can't be bothered with such trifles.

*When visiting Head Office, never approach Omin directly. Use the proper forms and filing procedures. After a brief four-month waiting time, you will be granted a very generous sixty-second meeting. It'll be the best minute of your life.*— Walnut Dankgrass
#### Jim Darkmagic Sets Things Straight
With absolutely no idea what they're meant to do or how they got into this position, the characters might try to seek out assistance before they leave Head Office. Or they might just wander around lost for a bit. Either way, Jim Darkmagic approaches the group with some words of... well, let's call it wisdom. When it's time for Jim to make his appearance, read or paraphrase the following:

>>A puff of smoke erupts out of nowhere. As the haze disperses, a handsome figure steps forward. It's Jim Darkmagic of the New Hampshire Darkmagics! Except he's wearing a set of glasses that he apparently thinks is an effective disguise as he bows before you.
>>
>>"I'm no one you know," he says. "But I couldn't help but notice that you seem a little flustered. I believe Omin just offered you work. And I also have a feeling you might not be the adventurers he thinks you are."
>>
>>Jim looks around to make sure no one else is listening in, then leans forward to deliver a conspiratorial whisper. "You want my advice? Do the job. If you can pull it off, Omin will be so impressed that you'll have a leg up on everybody else trying to gain footing with the company. You've heard the phrase "opportunity knocks?" Well, opportunity is heading right at your door with a battering ram. Stand in that doorway, friends. Let opportunity smash its way in."
>>

![[041-04-03.png|right|300]]

Jim's reasons for interceding with the characters are left to your determination. He might have intercepted the experienced adventurers Omin called for, then sent them off on a secret personal mission on his own behalf. Or he might have accidentally set them on fire when they arrived at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office. Whatever the case, he needs the players' group to attempt Omin's mission, and he's keen to get them on their way.

If the characters have any questions about the assignment, Jim can be the vessel through which you answer. Those who appear enthusiastic, appreciative, and deferential to Jim might even be gifted a *spell scroll* of *Jim's magic missile*. However, before an arcane caster can use the *spell scroll* or copy it into a spellbook, they need to understand the new royalty component for spells. See "*New Spells*" in chapter 3 for more information.

If the characters attempt to sort the case of mistaken identity out, Jim tells them Omin is unavailable, and concedes that they don't have to take the job. He points out that the characters are welcome to leave Acq Inc and never come back. But Omin might want to have words with them later about the dastardly way they misrepresented themselves.

After finishing up at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office, the adventurers can set off to perform their appointed mission.

*Jim Darkmagic is... uh... How do I put this? He's, uh... hmm. Let me get back to you.*— Omin Dran
## Dock Ward
Omin's assignment takes the characters to Dock Ward in Waterdeep, a maze of seedy tenements, rough streets, and even rougher alleyways. If the characters have spent time in the city, they might have heard that much of this ward is set up as safe houses, meeting places, and fronts for a variety of criminal organizations, including the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim. None of these groups are particularly happy right now, since the sinkhole caused by the earthquake opened up smack dab in the middle of their territory. The sinkhole also brought the Waterdeep City Watch to the ward, a move welcomed by no one—least of all the members of the Watch, who must now stand guard over the site until it can be investigated and closed.

A character whose background entails knowledge of the ward knows the general layout of its streets and alleys, but finding Jolly's Lamp Emporium and the abandoned warehouse requires asking for directions at some point. Use the following encounters as a general setup, but you can add additional encounters as the characters make their way through the ward as you see fit.

#### Maps and Poshuns
As the adventurers make their way through the streets of Dock Ward, they come upon an unlikely commercial venture.

>>A ramshackle stall set up along the street bears a sign that reads: "Maps and Poshuns." Working the stall is a filthy but cheerful gnome urchin. Several pieces of parchment are on display in the stall, with six small ceramic pots placed next to them.
>>

The rapscallion is Jerronimous "Jerr" Burntberry (CN male gnome **commoner**) who is quite a bit older than he looks. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check tips the characters off that the adult gnome is disguised to look like a youngster. Jerr hopes to join the Zhentarim one day, but he needs a little more experience. In the meantime, he makes a living by scribbling on pieces of parchment he scrounges from garbage heaps, selling them as maps to unwitting fools searching for places in Dock Ward. He also collects fetid rainwater in small, red clay pots, which leach out just enough color that he can pass the water off as *potions of healing*.

The potions have a faintly fruity aroma. A *detect magic* spell shows that they are indeed magical, though that magic is of the transmutation school rather than conjuration. Each day, a kindly druid who thinks Jerr is an honest soul gives the gnome a goodberry for his health. Rather than eat the berry, Jerr crushes it up and adds a drop of juice to each pot. Jerr sells maps for 1 gp and the potions for 10 gp. He also tries to sell other useless or counterfeit objects at your discretion.

If the adventurers ask Jerr to be a guide, he happily takes the job for 1 gp. He then leads the characters straight into an ambush by a gang working for the Zhentarim (see the "Skeleton Crew" encounter below). A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check is needed to see through the skilled lies of the gnome.

If you wish, Jerr can become a recurring character in the campaign. He might keep tabs on the characters as they grow famous, showing up in cities where they travel, trying to sell more useless goods, or eventually spying on them for the Zhentarim. Or if paid and treated well, he could become a valuable source of information for the characters when they need someone to infiltrate tough areas.

#### Skeleton Crew
As the characters make their way farther into Dock Ward, they encounter street thugs growing increasing resentful of the presence of the City Watch. These thugs need to earn some quick coin, then lay low until the Watch leaves the ward. And mugging the next group of distracted strangers to wander down the wrong street seems like just the ticket.

The four **bandit** members of the crew are run-of-the-mill criminals looking to get ahead in the world through treachery. Their leader, **Jelayne**, was similar... until she was killed a year before. **Jelayne** wasn't one to let death keep her down, however, and she continues to lead the group as an unusual **skeleton** with these changes:

- She has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 14 (+2).
- She can speak Common.

**Jelayne** isn't aware that she's undead. Even though the last of her flesh is constantly sloughing off her, she dismisses that effect as "allergies." The rest of the crew don't know what to do, since **Jelayne** has kept her intellect, knowledge, and personality. They have always followed her and done fine for themselves, so why let death interfere with a good thing?

When the encounter begins, read:

>>A figure stands in the alleyway, its luminous eyes glowing beneath a dark hood. As the hood is pulled away to reveal a skeletal face, the figure unexpectedly speaks. "Your money or your life!"
>>

The other members of the crew hide in adjacent alleyways or on the rooftop of a nearby building. They enter the fray if the characters don't surrender their valuables immediately.

If the adventurers defeat the crew and study **Jelayne**, a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check confirms that she was raised as undead by a unique ritual that allowed her to keep her intellect and ability to speak. This has no bearing on the encounter, but sets up the existence of such rituals as foreshadowing for later events. See the "A Horse is a Corpse, of Course" section and "The Magic of Convenience" sidebar in episode 2 for more information.

The work of the gnome archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop is a constant presence in episodes 2 and 3 of the adventure, even before his actual appearance toward the end of *episode 3*. Savvy players might note that the undead minions Hoobur creates to harry the party don't follow the standard rules by which a spellcaster character might create undead. Likewise, some of the creatures working for Hoobur do so in ways that aren't covered by *dominate monster*.

If the characters develop a strong interest in creating undead horses or summoning will-o'-wisps to their service, you can decide to reveal the "unique rituals" Hoobur knows, which can show up as treasure in the adventure or be something that the characters can learn through research. Otherwise, just assume that like many classic villains, Hoobur Gran'Shoop has access to whatever magic is necessary to advance the plot in the most interesting way.

***Treasure.*** In her belt pouch, **Jelayne** carries a *potion of healing*, 10 gp, and the bones of four of her toes that have fallen off. She used to be really attached to them.

#### The Mystic
Continuing on through Dock Ward, the characters catch unexpected sight of a kidnapping.

>>An old male human hobbles up the street, his long staff bearing most of his weight. His wrinkled face tells a tale of many hard years lived in poverty. As he passes an alleyway entrance, he looks up at you and grins, revealing his last few remaining teeth. But even as he opens his mouth as if to speak, a pair of meaty gray arms emerge from the alley entrance and yank him into the darkness.
>>

The characters are 20 feet from the alley entrance when the old man—a seer named Kal Ruudheart (NG male human **commoner**)—is grabbed. The perpetrators are Big Gustava (NE female **duergar**) and her friend who goes by the name **Devil Dog** (CE female tiefling **acolyte**). The two are street thieves trying to work their way up to larger scores. **Devil Dog** uses the acolyte stat block with these racial traits:

- She knows the *thaumaturgy* cantrip, and Charisma is her spellcasting ability for this spell.
- She has resistance to fire damage.
- She has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- She speaks Common and Infernal.

Big Gustava is the muscle of the duo. **Devil Dog** stays out of harm's way, fleeing quickly if it looks like the situation might turn dire. She saves her spells to aid her escape rather than using them offensively.

The thugs grabbed Kal because they heard the old fool can predict the future. They don't want to hurt him, but simply hope to persuade him to help them make as much coin as possible with little risk.

***Questioning Kal.*** If the characters save Kal, he looks at them with the same grin. He doesn't express gratitude, though, because his mind wanders through a different level of existence, as is the case for many mystics, celebrities, and financial planners. He laughs when asked a question. He answers questions that no one asked. He nods but says no, or vice versa, even when he has no reason to do so. However, when the second sight grips him, all that changes.

>>Kal's eyes come into focus and he becomes as sober as a priest of Ilmater at sunup. "Their plans are afoot," he whispers. "Their staff are ready. Their balance sheets are totaled, and that total is grim. They mean to bring the end of all things! You must seek the magic! Only you can stop them! Only you! You... are who again, sorry?"
>>

After this suitably dramatic and stylishly vague telegraphing of the adventure's archplot, Kal reverts to his normal abnormal state of mind for good.

***Treasure.*** Gustava wears a set of stylish silver earrings worth 40 gp.

**Devil Dog** carries nothing of value, but in exchange for her life, she promises to take her captors back to her apartment, where she says she keeps her money. Instead of doing so, however, she leads the characters on a merry walk through the worst parts of Dock Ward, where she knows six **bandits** who will attack them and allow her to flee.

## Warehouse Environs
Eventually, the characters spot the sign for Jolly's Lamp Emporium. Read the following as they move toward their goal:

>>Jolly's Lamp Emporium is an unassuming, ramshackle shop in the midst of other unassuming, ramshackle shops—including the collapsed warehouse next door. People in nearby shops and apartments peer warily through their shutters as you approach. Next to the warehouse, three members of the Waterdeep City Watch stand guard. No one else is on the street, except a seemingly inebriated halfling who stumbles toward you.
>>

#### Gray Hands Spy
The stumbling figure is Otis Adalgrim (NG male halfling **spy**). Otis works for the Gray Hands—members of the City Watch or the City Guard invited to join a special security force working directly for Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaff of Waterdeep. The Blackstaff fears that some evil faction might have been involved in the earthquake, and she has tasked Otis with watching the area in disguise to see who comes to investigate.

Otis pretends to ignore the group, although he makes note of their presence as he staggers by. Any character who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check gets the feeling that the halfling is only acting the part of a drunken passerby. If confronted, Otis does his best to maintain the facade. He moves away from the adventurers as quickly as possible, but he circles back to watch them as they interact with the City Watch and enter the sinkhole fissure.

Otis can be used as a wild card later in this episode of the adventure. For example, if the characters are faring poorly during the encounters under the warehouse, the halfling could follow and intervene on their behalf, healing unconscious party members or dragging them away from danger. Later in the campaign, Otis might act as a recurring NPC who crosses paths with the characters while they're in Waterdeep, making sure they have information they need and don't run afoul of the law.

#### The City Watch
The three members of the City Watch standing guard at the collapsed warehouse make sure no unauthorized people enter the area. At the same time, they ensure that nothing terrible escapes from the fissure into the city.

The leader of the trio is Captain Mergen Truff (NG female elf **veteran**), a laconic figure who would rather be doing "real work" than standing here warning off vagrants too foolish to avoid falling into a massive hole in the ground. Her companions are Orvis Torval (N male firbolg **guard**) and Rosko Bosh (N male halfling **guard**). Orvis and Rosko are new constables, not the sharpest swords in the armory, and as lazy as wizards who've used all their spell slots. Local thieves pay them to look the other way when ordered to do so, which becomes important later in the episode.

When the characters approach, Captain Truff steps forward, tells them that the area is off-limits, and orders them to move along. When the characters get across the purpose of their presence (most easily by stating that Omin Dran sent them), Truff is clearly relieved, though still not entirely friendly.

>>The captain sighs. "Took you long enough," she says. "So let's get this done so we can get on with our lives."
>>
>>She pulls a scroll from a leather pack and squints at its barely legible writing. "So which one of you is Ozgood the Ugly? I need you to sign before you go in. Nothing but paperwork and signatures since the newest Masked Lords got seated on the council, but what can you do?"
>>

***What Was Your Name Again.*** Captain Truff's scroll contains the names of the members of the adventuring party that Omin Dran thought he hired to do this job. The number of names conveniently matches the number of characters, and can include any of the following:

- Ozgood the Ugly
- Carlot "Squeaky" Wickel
- "Great Maul" McTickleton
- Lord Pompy Fuggelstruck
- Squinty Pip
- Mad Haddey Flagon
- Fippance Gibberjaw

To gain access to the warehouse and the sinkhole fissure, the characters must pretend to be the named adventurers. Assume that the City Watch members know the names and reputations of some of the adventurers on the list, but have never met them in person. If a character pretends to be Lord Pompy Fuggelstruck and speaks to the guards, Captain Truff might think it odd that they aren't speaking with Fuggelstruck's well-known lisp, or predilection for using rhyming couplets, or what have you. You can let roleplaying determine the outcome, or call for DC 10 Charisma (Deception) checks for the characters to pass off any outright lies.

Captain Truff is eager to get someone—anyone—to investigate the fissure as soon as possible, allowing her to go back to her normal duties. Even if she becomes suspicious that the characters aren't the adventurers named on the scroll, as long as someone signs as Ozgood, she's content to allow them to investigate.

***Useful Information.*** Once the characters' identities are "confirmed," they might have some questions for the guards. Use the following points to steer the conversation—and make sure to work in the first three points as a warning from the guards, even if the players fail to seek more information:

- The fissure opened beneath the warehouse during the earthquake two days ago. The partially collapsed building has been deemed structurally sound, so it shouldn't fall into the fissure unless someone inside does something foolish, such as knock down a support beam or bang against the remaining walls.
- The fissure has exposed access to a number of mysterious tunnels beneath the warehouse. It's not known how long the tunnels have been there, who created them, or what might be lurking within.
- The contract the characters sign is fulfilled only if they investigate and clear every tunnel the fissure exposed. After they finish, a city surveyor will be assigned to map the area, and an engineer needs to assess the integrity of the tunnels to ensure that no further collapses are imminent. If either professional is injured or killed because of negligence on the part of the adventurers, the party and Acquisitions Incorporated can be held liable.
- Two members of the City Watch—Sergeant Ava Teeshe and Constable Yander Boot—descended into the fissure a day earlier to make sure it held nothing dangerous. From the bottom of the sinkhole, they followed an underground passage north. They haven't been seen or heard from since.
- Sergeant Teeshe is a tall, strapping female human who has seen her share of scuffles and doesn't back down from a fight. If something took her out, it must be powerful.
- By contrast, Constable Boot is a runty male human, and infamous for his cowardice. However, anything that caught him while he tried to flee must be fast.
- The three guards have been ordered to remain on site until the exploration of the fissure is complete. Captain Truff is clear in articulating her hopes that the adventurers can wrap up the investigation quickly. Every second she spends in this unruly section of Dock Ward grates on her nerves.

#### Jolly's Lamp Emporium
If the characters enter this shop at any point during their time around the warehouse, they find the short, rotund proprietor standing behind a rough-hewn counter. Jolly (NE male half-orc **thug**) maintains this business as a front for the Xanathar Guild. The number of lamps in the so-called Lamp Emporium totals exactly six. From the looks of those wares, it's not clear that any of the lamps actually work.

Stolen coins, valuables, and other black-market goods are stored in a secret room in the back until they are ready to be sold. Guild members use the shop's other back rooms to hide from the authorities or plan jobs. At the moment, the only person in the building other than Jolly is a Xanathar Guild agent who goes by the moniker Feather (NE female half-elf **assassin**).

Feather is lying low after a failed assassination attempt in the South Ward the previous night (see the "Life in Waterdeep" sidebar earlier in this episode), and pretends to be Jolly's assistant. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine or Perception) check allows a character to notice that Feather moves stiffly, as if her shoulder is badly injured.

Jolly does his best to get the adventurers out of his shop as quickly as possible. If asked about the earthquake or the fissure beneath the warehouse next door, he says only that he heard the ground shake and felt the warehouse cave in. If the adventurers threaten force and succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, they can convince Jolly to give up the one useful piece of information he knows. The tunnels beneath the warehouse were used by thieves at one time, but they were abandoned because of unknown dangers that came up from the darkness below. Jolly has no idea what those dangers might be.

## The Fissure
![[043-04-05.png|right|300]]

When the fissure opened up at the bottom of the sinkhole, it exposed a number of tunnels used for a variety of purposes and by a multitude of people over the years. The first of the tunnels beneath the warehouse were dug as smugglers' byways. Later, worshipers of That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the "*New Race: Verdan*" section in chapter 3) excavated chambers beneath the ground to hold clandestine meetings and worship at a secret shrine of destruction. Various thieves' guilds employed the tunnels to move from place to place secretly. Renegade wizards did terrible experiments there. At one point, part of the Waterdeep sewer system crossed into the tunnel network. Not long after, the subterranean spaces were abandoned.

As a result of the earthquake, many of the tunnel system's side passages have been blocked by rubble. The limited zone that is still traversable leads the characters from the fissure to the lost shrine of destruction—and through a number of dangerous areas in between.

When the adventurers enter the warehouse, read:

>>In the areas where the walls and ceiling didn't collapse, this warehouse contains no crates, no boxes, no barrels, and no wares of any other kind. Directly in front of the missing door, the walls, ceiling, and floor have fallen away to reveal a deep sinkhole fissure. Inside the ruin, a hempen rope anchored firmly in the rubble dangles down into the darkness. The tear in the earth descends at an angle, making it impossible to see how far down it goes or what waits at the bottom.
>>

Descending into the fissure is easily done by characters using the rope, but requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check by anyone climbing down the rough stone walls. On a failed check, a character tumbles down the sloping fissure and takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

Maps 1.2 and 1.3 show the layout of the caverns and chambers beneath the fissure.

![[045-map-1-2-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### 1. Rats
When the first character reaches the bottom of the sinkhole, read:

>>The sinkhole fissure ends at a level floor of worked stone. Dust, debris, rocks, and pieces of wood that once made up the walls and ceiling of the warehouse above are spread across the floor. An underground passage is blocked to the south, but it continues into darkness to the north. Two pairs of human-sized boot prints, easily spotted in the dust, head northward. Smaller fissures, holes, and cracks riddle the passage, though even a halfling would find the largest of them a tight fit.
>>

The floor of the corridor is difficult terrain for 20 feet around the point where the characters descend.

***Creatures.*** After the first character has been at the bottom of the fissure for 2 rounds, a group of six **giant rats** notices the potential feast. Any character at the bottom of the fissure who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear the approaching rats, and isn't surprised when three rats emerge from cracks in the walls and attack. Three more rats arrive and attack 1 round later. All the rats are dyed a bright green from trap C in area 3.

***Treasure.*** When the final rat dies, it coughs up a humanoid finger bearing a platinum ring worth 20 gp. Etched inside the ring is the name "Burton Boot." The ring belonged to the father of Yander Boot, the deceased constable of the Watch, and was bitten off by the rat after Boot was killed (see area 5).

#### 2. Trials
The earthquake sealed many of the passages that once made up this underground maze. As the characters explore, they pass through worked tunnels, natural caverns, and functional sewers at different points. Most side passages are blocked by rubble, making the path of the two Waterdeep City Watch guards easy to follow.

The next area of interest on the adventurers' journey is a chamber that the followers of That-Which-Endures once used as a testing ground for new recruits.

>>This rectangular chamber shows no earthquake damage, possibly because of the buttresses and columns supporting the walls and ceiling. Four pools of liquid are set into the floor—one blue, another green, a third clear, and the last cloudy. Carvings on the walls seemingly depict the pools, and show robed figures submerging themselves within. At the far end of the chamber stands a double door with a large, ornately carved lock.
>>

The pools represent the trials the characters must undertake to pass the test of That-Which-Endures. Each pool is 10 feet deep and has sheer sides. To trigger the effects of a pool, a creature must completely submerge itself in its liquid. The pools and the double door radiate transmutation to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect.

***Double Doors.*** The lock on the double doors opens with a key granted by passing the trials of the pools (see below). If the characters have that key, they can open the doors without consequences.

Opening the lock without the key requires a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using *thieves' tools*. Any unsuccessful attempt to pick the lock triggers a trap (see below). The door cannot be broken down or otherwise smashed, and attempting to do so triggers the trap.

A successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to spot faint runes etched among the ornate carvings on the lock. A subsequent DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check to study the runes reveals that they can emit a wave of transmutation magic throughout the room.

***Blue Pool.*** A character fully submerged in the blue pool must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw as images of horror overwhelm their mind. On a failure, the character has visions of terrible calamities such as rotting flesh, crumbling edifices, and political speeches. This trauma imposes disadvantage on initiative rolls. On a successful save, these visions put the character on edge, granting advantage on initiative rolls. Either effect lasts until the end of the character's next long rest.

***Green Pool.*** A character fully submerged in this pool must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw as poison courses into their body. On a failure, the character takes 5 (1d10) poison damage and gains vulnerability to poison damage. On a successful save, the character takes no damage and gains resistance to poison damage. Either effect lasts until the end of the character's next long rest.

***Clear Pool.*** A character fully submerged in this pool must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw as the infinite possibilities of the multiverse seep into their brain. On a failure, overwhelming theoretical possibilities impose one level of exhaustion on the character. On a successful save, the character gains a clarity of mind that grants advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks and saving throws. Either effect lasts until the end of the character's next long rest.

***Cloudy Pool.*** A character fully submerged in this pool must make a DC 10 Wisdom check to endure the intense itching caused by the acid that fills it. On a failure, the character takes 5 (1d10) acid damage and gains vulnerability to acid damage. On a successful save, the character takes no damage and gains resistance to acid damage. Either effect lasts until the end of the character's next long rest.

***Entropy's Parting Gift.*** If the same character is submerged in all four pools, that character receives the blessing of That-Which-Endures. This blessing comes in handy later in area 7.

***Key.*** To make the key appear, one or more characters must enter all four pools, whether the outcome is good or bad. When a character is submerged in the last pool, a silver key studded with polished red garnets appears in midair in the center of the room.

***Door Trap.*** Any creature in the room when the trap on the double doors triggers must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is transformed into a **poisonous snake** for 1d4 rounds, as if affected by the *polymorph* spell. The snakes are compelled to attack any other creatures in the room.

***Treasure.*** In addition to opening the door, the key is worth 25 gp.

> ##### Resting
>No pressing matters force the characters to complete their investigation quickly. This episode is for 1st-level adventurers, and the characters are at their most vulnerable at this level. As such, it's important to allow them to take rests. However, if the players become overly cautious and attempt to take a long rest after every encounter, have wandering monsters interrupt their attempts to sleep. Any low-challenge cavern-dwelling beasts are perfect for prodding the adventurers along.
>

#### 3. Traps
This part of the underground complex contains a number of traps installed by the previous occupants. The traps were set up to scare people away rather than kill them. Mostly.

When the characters enter this area, read:

>>As the passage runs east, it widens to thirty feet for the next ninety feet. At the far end of the area, the chamber narrows to ten feet again, with an ornate double door sealing it off.
>>

Four different traps protect this room, with each of their areas of effect marked on the map. The magic of traps A and C can be dispelled, or can be suppressed for 1 minute with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

***Trap A.*** With a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices that the floor in this area shows signs of charring that obscures faint runes. A weak fire trap triggers if any creature enters the area, which radiates evocation to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. Each creature in the area when the trap triggers takes 2 (1d4) fire damage.

***Trap B.*** This pit trap triggers when weight is put on it. Locating the trap requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check, but the check is made with disadvantage unless the creature making it is within 5 feet of the trap. When the pit opens, the triggering creature drops into a 10-foot-deep pit and takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. The lid remains open, and the pit begins filling with water flowing up from grates in the floor—along with small, glowing blue fish. These are harmless glowing cave fish, but it takes a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check to recognize that. The fish immediately start to bite any exposed skin of a creature in the water, but the result is only healthful exfoliation.

With a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, a character can climb the rough walls of the pit, or can stay floating while the pit fills and eventually clamber out.

***Trap C.*** Nearly invisible runes cover the floor in this area. The runes radiate conjuration to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect, or can be detected with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. When a creature steps into the area, the runes conjure up a swirling cloud of green dye that covers each creature in the area that fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

The magical dye is nontoxic, cruelty free, pet safe, and hypoallergenic. It vanishes if an affected creature is targeted by *dispel magic*. Otherwise, it takes 1d4 months to fade, even with constant scrubbing. Additionally, any savvy thief operating in the civilized settlements of the Sword Coast recognizes that a character covered in this dye fell victim to a trap. Those thieves might target such characters as easy marks in future adventures.

***Trap D.*** The area of trap D appears as normal stone, and its trigger is contained in the double door. It takes a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to recognize subtle details in the stonework revealing the trap's area.

When any creature touches the double doors, including to pick the lock, each creature standing in area D must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to the mummy chamber (see below).

***Double Doors.*** The ornate double doors here are locked, and are the trigger for trap D. They radiate conjuration to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. Opening the doors requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using *thieves' tools*. The doors can also be smashed open with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check, or broken down with attacks (AC 10, 30 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).

***Mummy Chamber.*** When the characters can see the chamber beyond the double doors, read:

>>Slabs set along the walls of this stone chamber hold human-sized bodies wrapped from head to toe in strips of off-white cloth. Even as the doors open, these wrapped bodies begin to rise.
>>

The cloth-wrapped bodies that first rise off the slabs and lurch toward the characters are four **zombies**. But any creatures teleported by the double doors are also in this chamber, having been magically wrapped in cloth and temporarily paralyzed. When the doors are opened, each paralyzed creature must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can act freely. It takes an action for a creature to tear away the cloth wrappings on itself or another creature.

On a failed save, the creature is no longer paralyzed but is compelled to rise along with the zombies and move toward the doors. Characters caught by this compulsion are indistinguishable from the zombies, though they aren't forced to attack. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the creature shambles around for 1 minute.

***Treasure.*** Each of the zombies wears a silver necklace worth 10 gp. Resting on one of the slabs is a *potion of healing* and a *spell scroll* of *bless*.

#### 4. Tunnels
An extensive tunnel system beyond the trap room does not appear on the map. This area is a complex maze of passages crisscrossing each other, collapsed tunnels forcing the characters to take side passages, weak areas exposed by the earthquake and threatening to collapse, and so on. To successfully navigate this area, the characters must tread carefully, look for signs of previous passage and structural weakness, dodge falling rocks, and use their wits.

***Picking Up the Trail.*** The characters' first task is to stay on the trail left by Sergeant Teeshe and Constable Boot. Doing so requires one character to succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. On a successful check, the characters remain safely on the trail. On a failed check, they veer off the trail at one point into an unsafe passage weakened by the earthquake. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage from falling rocks.

***Clearing a Path.*** The trail leads to an area where a cave-in occurred sometime after Teeshe and Boot passed through. To clear the cave-in, the characters work together to move the debris and secure the passage. This task involves a group ability check in which the characters can use different ability checks and skills to represent different tasks. Moving debris requires a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Shoring up the passage requires a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation or Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check. The passage is cleared regardless of the result of the group check, but if more than half the characters fail the group check, each character suffers one level of exhaustion in the process.

***Blood Weeds.*** A circular passage is overgrown with vines emerging from the walls, floor, and ceiling. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes the vines as blood weeds—a carnivorous plant that feeds on creatures by draining blood with its thorns.

![[046-04-07.png|right|300]]

To pass through the area, each character must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), or Wisdom (Survival) check to avoid the vines. Too many vines choke the passage for the characters to attack them effectively with weapons. However, damaging the vines with fire or cold damage from a spell of 1st level or higher gives creatures moving up the tunnel advantage on their ability checks. Each creature that fails the check takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage from the blood-draining thorns.

***Obligatory Acid Pit.*** The final passageway of the maze contains a pit trap filled with weak acid and floating bones. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check notices the hinged floor. With a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using *thieves' tools*, a character can disable the trap by using shims to jam the top closed. If the check fails, the character thinks the trap was deactivated even though it wasn't.

If the trap is triggered, the first character stepping onto it falls into the acid-filled pit. Any creature that enters the pit for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there takes 2 (1d4) acid damage. Climbing out of the rough-sided pit is a trivial task.

#### 5. Death
The next chamber contains the body of Constable Yander Boot. Caught in a web when fleeing from a giant spider, Boot succumbed to the spider's poison. His corpse now hangs suspended from the ceiling, wrapped in webs.

When the characters enter the chamber, read:

>>The passage expands into a natural cavern whose ceiling is obscured by thick, dusty webs. Five web cocoons hang down from the larger mass, their bottoms dangling ten feet above the cavern floor. Two cocoons—one larger and one smaller—have a suspiciously humanoid shape.
>>

***Creature.*** The **giant spider** hides in a dust-filled depression in the floor. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the arachnid before it springs from its hiding place to attack. Any characters who are focused on the webs above them have disadvantage on the check. Those who fail the check are surprised.

The giant spider initially favors its web attack, hoping to restrain a couple of characters before it starts biting. If reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, the spider retreats into a nearby narrow fissure. However, it attacks again when the characters come back through this area.

***Treasure.*** If the characters cut down the web cocoons, they find the corpses of three giant rats, Constable Boot, and a kobold explorer. The kobold has a *vial of acid*, a *flask of alchemist's fire*, and a *vial of antitoxin*. The deceased Boot has a *flask of holy water* and a *potion of healing*.

![[048-map-1-3-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### 6. Goblin
When Caerhan Coalsmith ventured into these caverns, his goblin sidekick Gorkoh (N male **goblin**) came with him. Caerhan and the other members of his adventuring party had spared Gorkoh's life a few months back when they cleared out a temple to Maglubiyet, the chief of the goblin gods. Caerhan saw potential for the goblin to become a productive member of society, so he became a friend and mentor to Gorkoh, and encouraged him to learn about magic. Caerhan has also encouraged Gorkoh to expand his Common vocabulary, with inconsistent results.

Since becoming separated from Caerhan during a carrion crawler attack, Gorkoh has hidden here waiting for his mentor to return. He is starting to fear (rightfully) that Caerhan is dead, however, and if the characters treat him kindly, he might be convinced to join them. Gorkoh carries standard goblin weapons, plus three *potions of healing* and a *spell scroll* of *fog cloud* that Caerhan gave him for safekeeping and study.

When the characters enter this chamber, read:

>>The passage widens into a natural cavern dotted with stalactites and stalagmites. It continues on to the northeast, but the uneven walls make it hard to see into that section—even as heap of bones and gear is plainly visible.
>>

Gorkoh hides behind one of the smaller stalagmites in the southeast section of the cavern. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check spots him hiding there. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that the goblin is watching the group with trepidation. If the characters let Gorkoh know they see him, he quickly steps forth.

>>The goblin emerges from behind a stalagmite and brandishes a gnarled piece of bleached wood. "I am a powerful wizard. My wand annihilates all those who make me uptight. Go away. Leave Gorkoh alone, and there's no annihilate. Gorkoh is merciful." He thrusts his wand several times in your direction.
>>

Gorkoh continues to bluff, pretending his gnarled stick of polished driftwood is a magic wand. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that Gorkoh is bluffing. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character can intuit that Gorkoh is terrified. If anyone makes even the slightest effort to reassure Gorkoh that they have no plans to hurt him, the goblin relaxes.

If the characters engage Gorkoh in conversation, he tells of how he and Caerhan came to these caverns in search of a lost shrine, and how Caerhan's goal was to destroy some old magic relic. Regarding the relic, Gorkoh knows only that it's "some broken clock thing," and that it was responsible for killing the other members of Caerhan's party. He tells of how the two became separated during a carrion crawler attack in the cavern just beyond this one. Caerhan must have escaped deeper into the tunnels, but Gorkoh wasn't willing to risk facing the monster to follow.

If on friendly terms with the characters (or if he needs to offer up information to save his skin), Gorkoh can offer advice on the best way to deal with the carrion crawler, pointing out a fragile and sharp stalactite cluster at a narrow point leading into the next cavern. If the characters lure the creature under the cluster, they might be able to think of some way to drop the sharp rocks on the crawler.

If the characters try to hurt or intimidate Gorkoh, he attempts to send them into the carrion crawler's domain unprepared, hoping that the monster takes care of them.

***Creature.*** The **carrion crawler** waits in the next area, resting after taking a beating from Caerhan. The creature has only 20 hit points remaining, but it's hungry and angry. It attacks if any character enters the next cavern, and pursues characters who flee in any direction.

![[049-04-08.png|right|300]]

***Weak Ceiling.*** The sharp stalactites in the passage between the two chambers were weakened by the earthquake. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation or Nature) or Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check can spot the danger zone if Gorkoh didn't tell the group about it. As an action, a character can strike the ceiling with a weapon or an appropriate tool, or with a spell that deals force or thunder damage. Doing so brings down the ceiling in a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. Any creature caught in the shower of razor-sharp stones must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Treasure.*** The bones and gear to the northeast are the remains of a group of adventurers who fell victim to the carrion crawler months ago. A backpack and a belt pouch hold 47 gp and a large polished red garnet worth 50 gp. Sticking out of the pile of bones is a *+1 longsword*. The hilt of the sword is fashioned like a skeletal hand, and a skull-and-bones motif is prominent in the design of the weapon.

***Gorkoh's Future.*** Provided the characters treat Gorkoh well, he's willing to serve the group as a hireling. In return for food and lodging, he becomes a reliable and enterprising employee.

On the other hand, if the characters mistreat him or regularly put him in danger, Gorkoh abandons them. If that happens, another goblin named Splugoth the Returned approaches Gorkoh with alternative employment. Gorkoh can show up later in the adventure as a servant of the Six, having gained new powers and seeking vengeance on those who mistreated him. See "*Factions and Rivals*" in chapter 3 for more information on the Six, and *appendix B* for more information on Splugoth.

#### 7. Stomp
When the characters can see into this chamber, read:

>>This enormous chamber is roughly circular with a high ceiling. A huge granite block is suspended near the ceiling in the center of the room, carved into the rough shape of what looks like a giant foot. Runes scribed into the north and south walls of the chamber create the outline image of a bare footprint.
>>
>>Scattered about the room are hundreds of rotting severed feet from countless types of humanoids. All the feet are bare. Despite the horrid wounds that severed the feet, you see no blood anywhere.
>>

***Creatures.*** Ten of the feet in the room are stomping feet, the lesser known and smellier cousins to the crawling claw. A **stomping foot** uses the **crawling claw** stat block with these changes:

- Its speed is 30 feet and it has no climbing speed.
- Its claw attack becomes a stomp attack that deals bludgeoning damage.

When any creature reaches the center of the room, the feet attack.

***The Big Foot.*** When the **stomping feet** attack, the suspended granite block activates, then acts on initiative count 0 each round. This magical hazard was created to crash down upon those who lack devotion to That-Which-Endures. As such, the Big Foot ignores any creature that gained the blessing of That-Which-Endures by submerging in all four pools in area 2. It targets one random creature each round, which must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. The Big Foot ceases attacking if all the stomping feet are slain.

The rune-graven footprints on the north and south walls power the magic of the Big Foot. A character can deactivate the magic of the runes by standing within 5 feet of a footprint and using an action to succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check. Alternatively, a character who places their own bare foot on the wall inside the rune-marked footprint automatically succeeds at deactivating those runes. Deactivating both footprints halts the Big Foot's attacks.

***Development.*** A murderer in Waterdeep has been killing people, taking their feet, and placing them on an altar hidden in the city as a sacrifice to That-Which-Endures. (A hint of the killings is noted in the "Life in Waterdeep" sidebar earlier in this episode.) Any feet placed on the altar teleport to this room. By placing clues on the feet that lead to the murderer, you can create a side trek mystery for the characters. You can also have two more feet suddenly appear in midair near the ceiling, then drop into the room as the adventurers fight.

#### 8. Tentacle
When the characters investigate this chamber, read:

>>The tunnel opens into a round room. Dirty brown water—sewage, judging by the smell—streams from pipes in the ceiling into a massive cesspool at the center of the room. A ten-foot-wide walkway skirts the pool, leading to a passageway on the other side.
>>

***Cesspool.*** Untold numbers of sewer pipes from the city empty their waste here. The first 10 feet of the cesspool are only 3 feet deep, but the inner area is 10 feet deep.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recalls this bizarre cesspool as the experiment of an ambitious Masked Lord of Waterdeep from decades ago. After locating a gate to a demiplane of filth, the Masked Lord attempted to build a sewer system that could empty the city's waste into that plane. It worked well, and plans were made to expand the sewer system beyond the prototype. But then creatures native to the plane of filth came through the gate in the wrong direction. After hiring mercenaries to drive the creatures back, the city rulers abandoned the plan, and the gate was sealed.

Or at least that's what everyone thought. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana, Nature, or Religion) check can sense that planar magic still fills this area. The stones of the cesspool likewise radiate conjuration to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect.

![[050-04-10.png|right|300]]

***Creature.*** A massive creature on the demiplane of filth has reached a long tentacle through the weak planar barrier here. The creature's tremorsense allows it to detect the presence of creatures in this room, at which point it attacks. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice ripples on the cesspool before the tentacle emerges. If the characters know the room's story or sensed the magic here, they have advantage on the check. The tentacle surprises anyone who fails the check.

The **enormous tentacle** uses the stat block of a **giant constrictor snake** with these changes:

- It can reach anywhere inside this room.
- It has no bite attack.

A creature grappled by the tentacle is pulled immediately into the 3-foot-deep section of the cesspool. On the next round, if the creature is still grappled, the tentacle pulls it into the 10-foot-deep section and under the sewage. There, the tentacle has three-quarters cover, and the creature can't breathe. A creature that falls unconscious while grappled beneath the sewage is pulled through the planar rupture into the filth plane, to be devoured and lost forever. Or, in grand Acquisitions Incorporated fashion, a character so destroyed might return later as a vile creature bent on revenge against its former party members.

#### 9. Dragon
A wyrmling brass dragon wound up in this cavern after a green dragon chased it away from its territory. (This is the green dragon mentioned in the "Life in Waterdeep" sidebar.) The wyrmling, which calls itself Dabshabah, entered a sea cave near Waterdeep that contained a passage leading to this complex of tunnels and caverns. She was hiding when the earthquake struck, and was trapped beneath fallen rubble.

When the characters enter the chamber from the south, Dabshabah is fending off a pair of darkmantles, so they can hear the fight before they see it.

>>A small, brass-colored dragon thrashes madly at the far end of the cavern, trapped beneath two large boulders that block a northern tunnel. Two dark creatures resembling flying squids dart just out of the little dragon's reach, harassing it. Another northern tunnel is also blocked with rubble. Only a tunnel to the east stands clear of debris.
>>

***Creatures.*** The two **darkmantles** understand that the dragon is doomed to eventually die of its wounds, and that they can have an easy meal in a few hours if they bide their time. They are thus staying out of the dragon's reach. Dabshabah can't use her breath weapon against the darkmantles because the weight of the boulders makes it hard for her to breathe.

When the characters engage the darkmantles, the monsters ignore the dragon to focus on the new threat. Both creatures fight to the death.

***Aftermath.*** If the characters defeat the darkmantles, Dabshabah (a **brass dragon wyrmling**) is thankful. If they use magic to heal the wounds she suffered during the earthquake, she is even more grateful. However, she expresses that gratitude with an inflated sense of her importance in the world. Remember that dragons aren't like people. Even the good ones can be haughty, proud, entitled, demanding, self-involved, and prone to violence. (Okay, maybe they are like people.)

Dabshabah is less than a year old, and she shares the story of how a green dragon attacked her and her siblings, driving her away from her mother's territory and down the Sword Coast. She can also confirm that she saw an armed and armored female human—Sergeant Ava Teeshe—pass through this chamber and head east some hours ago. Dabshabah kept silent, fearing the human would slay her.

*Large capital assets such as dragons are a good investment. But you need to remember to record them on your balance sheet at the original cost minus depreciation due to the minor dismemberment or occasional consumption of staff.*— Môrgæn***Ahghairon's Dragonward.*** Waterdeep is protected by a magical ward that keeps dragons from entering the city. The ward doesn't reach this far below ground, so Dabshabah is safe here. However, if the characters attempt to bring her out of the fissure, she can't follow them. The dragon whines and sobs when it becomes clear that the characters must leave her behind. Arranging to meet somewhere outside the city quiets her, but Dabshabah demands assurances that the party won't abandon her.

> ##### A Powerful Pet
>It might be fun to run Dabshabah as an NPC member of the party for a bit. However, any dragon—even a chaotic good wyrmling—can be tough to manage. Townsfolk are likely to be terrified at the prospect of a dragon coming into their shops and taverns. Moreover, caring for Dabshabah to her own high standards, including meeting her needs for sustenance and treasure, is equivalent to maintaining a character in a wealthy lifestyle.
>
>That said, having Dabshabah stay with the party for a short time, then take off on her own to learn the business of being a dragon, could provide a bit of poignant narrative in your campaign. Much later on, if the characters are ever facing long odds in an important battle, Dabshabah might swoop down from the sky to return the favor the heroes once did for her.
>

#### 10. Shrine of Destruction
In this final area of the caverns, the characters discover the missing City Watch guard, the dead dwarf who caused all this mess—and a magical mystery that kicks off the rest of the adventure. When the characters enter this area, read:

>>This crumbling chamber is dominated by an altar against the far wall, above which hangs some kind of construct gearwork mechanism ending in a massive maul. The wall to the left of the altar has fallen in to spread rubble across the floor. On the floor near the altar is a golden device resembling an orrery housing. The device is battered and falling apart, revealing exposed gears and spokes, and with its exterior pieces and plating scattered across the floor. Splayed on the ground next to the device is the corpse of a dwarf.
>>
>>In the southwest corner of the room stands a muscular female human dressed in the livery of the Waterdeep City Watch. Her eyes are closed, and she breathes deeply as though resting.
>>

The dead dwarf is Caerhan Coalsmith. Sergeant Teeshe stands in the corner. The magical housing of the *Orrery of the Wanderer* sits before the altar.

***Creatures.*** Teeshe touched the altar when she first entered this area, and a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures possessed her (see below). If the adventurers touch or disturb anything in this chamber (including the altar, the gearwork maul, or Teeshe herself), the spirit controlling Sergeant Teeshe forces her to attack. Use the **thug** stat block for her in this state.

***Entropy Guardian.*** The gearwork device above the altar is called an entropy guardian, and it animates 1 round after Teeshe attacks. The entropy guardian's expanding clockwork arms allow it to attack anywhere in the room, but it cannot attack beyond it. On initiative count 10, it makes two attacks per round: +4 to hit, 7 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage. The damaged entropy guardian is a Huge object with AC 18, 32 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It focuses its attacks on intruders within 5 feet of the altar, anyone fighting with Sergeant Teeshe, and anyone holding the orrery housing (which its magic recognizes as an ongoing threat).

***Altar.*** The altar is made of granite and covered in runes. It accepts offerings by destroying them with the attacks of the entropy guardian, representing the entropic power of That-Which-Endures. However, the ancient altar malfunctioned when Caerhan set the orrery housing on it—or perhaps the orrery channeled its own powerful magic to destroy the altar in self-defense. Either way, that pulse of power caused the earthquake, and saw the entropy guardian slay the unfortunate Caerhan when it took him as a threat to the shrine.

A character who touches the altar willingly must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures. While charmed in this way, the character must use its action each turn to attack any creature defiling the shrine. This effect lasts for as long as the affected creature remains in this area, but the compulsion also prevents the creature from leaving the shrine.

***Sergeant Teeshe.*** The City Watch officer is under the sway of a possessing spirit from the altar, as noted above. She attacks any creatures that appear to be a threat to the shrine, but a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check allows a character to see the unfocused look in her eyes, as if she's not in control of her actions. If she can be removed from this area, the altar's power over her ends, and Teeshe comes back to her right mind. If the characters save her, the sergeant offers a *potion of healing* in thanks. She doesn't remember what happened to her after entering the tunnels with Constable Boot, and is keen to accompany the characters back out.

***Development.*** If a character tries to identify the runes on the altar, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check determines only that they are connected to no known deity, but that their symbology associates them with the power of destruction and ruin. The magic of the altar and the gearwork maul is faltering, but would once have been capable of destroying even powerful magic items.

Any character who succeeds on the above check or on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check to study the destruction here determines that a powerful pulse of magical power centered in this area is likely what caused the earthquake. The character also intuits that with the shrine's destructive magic curtailed by the earthquake, it is no longer a threat.

***The Orrery.*** The *Orrery of the Wanderer* is a powerful magic artifact, detailed in *appendix D*. In its present state, the orrery has been battered by the entropy guardian, though its six-sided form remains intact. Its side plating is mostly missing, but can be collected from the floor nearby. If characters replace any of the shattered side plating, it magically reattaches itself. More oddly, if the characters don't replace the plating, it begins to regrow, even as the orrery housing magically straightens itself out.

Within a few days, the orrery housing is a pristine, golden six-sided device with a circular hole in each face. The setup of gears and attachments within the orrery makes it clear that six round components are meant to be placed into the device. Characters will not recall seeing any such devices in the shrine of destruction.

## Exiting the Fissure
With Sergeant Teeshe saved (or with her body in tow and a convenient cover story), the characters can make their way back to the sinkhole. If they left any dangers behind them on their initial pass, those dangers reemerge on the trip back—and will prevent them from fulfilling their contract if not eliminated.

When the characters climb out of the sinkhole, Captain Truff is waiting for them alone, and is pleased to see them. She's even more pleased if the characters rescued Sergeant Teeshe. Truff asks the characters to sign an affidavit confirming that they've completely investigated and cleared the passages beyond the fissure. If the characters lie about the success of their mission, they risk a fine, imprisonment, or both.

The characters must also agree to have all the goods they found beneath the city inventoried. If anyone later claims to be the rightful owner of any of the loot, a magistrate might rule that the goods belong to the original owner instead of the characters. Who knew adventuring required so much paperwork?

#### Dock Ward Ambush
While the NPCs and characters are going over their bookkeeping, a group of villains working for the Xanathar Guild tries to take any treasure the party pulled out of the tunnels. The group consists of a **thug** called Stork leading three **bandits**. Stork believes she has the advantage over the party members, who are probably coming out of the tunnels bruised and bloodied. Plus, she's already bribed the two City Watch guards, Orvis Torval and Rosko Bosh, to "take a walk," so neither is on hand during the attack.

Captain Truff fights alongside the characters, as do Gorkoh and Sergeant Teeshe if the characters rescued them. Otis Adalgrim might show up too, either during or after the fight.

## Conclusion
With this first episode completed, the characters attain 2nd level! But even as they get to bask in the warm glow of that achievement, they must return to Acquisitions Incorporated to report. Omin Dran is there to meet with them when they do. If the characters were successful and dealt with Captain Truff in good faith, Omin gives them the promised reward of 400 gp for the group (500 gp minus the Acquisitions Incorporated fee). If the characters were only partly successful, adjust Omin's reaction and what follows as necessary.

Having since learned about the initial mistaken identity when he met the characters, Omin is even more impressed by their success. Or he might be in the mood to demand favors from them if things didn't go entirely as planned (because that kind of mess makes the whole company look bad). Either way, read:

>>"I've been told about the misunderstanding regarding your identities. I can't say much for your relative inexperience and lack of skill. But it looks as though you've got enough moxie to cover for that. And a willingness to do what it takes to get ahead. Those are traits we hold in high regard here at Acquisitions Incorporated."
>>
>>Omin pulls a map from a satchel and places it on the conference room's oak table. "You know the town of Phandalin? Just off the Triboar Trail? A few months back, we awarded a group a franchise there. We received word that they were taking control of some ruined estate for their headquarters, and everything seemed to be going well. Only they missed this month's franchise payment, and their secretarian isn't answering any calls."
>>
>>Omin snaps his fingers, and a paper, a pen, and an ink pot leap from his satchel. "This note gives you the right to travel to Phandalin and investigate the franchise there on my behalf. If you find the franchise in poor standing or otherwise in distress, I want a full report. And depending on how badly the last group botched things, I might look to you to take over. A failed franchise makes the whole company look bad. I'm sure you understand."
>>
>>Omin then levels a hard stare. "I want you to appreciate what an incredible opportunity this is for you. You're skipping countless steps in the normal franchise process. No internships. No tests. It's unheard of. But I believe in you."
>>

As before, Omin Dran is a busy CEO, and doesn't have time for a lot of questions. If the characters discuss finding the mysterious orrery housing, he tells them to make researching the relic part of their mission. With the characters all newly minted, official Acquisitions Incorporated employees, Omin trusts that they'll know what to do.

## Franchise Downtime
Once the characters formally establish their franchise at the end of episode 2, downtime activities and franchise tasks will play a bigger role in the adventure. For now, though, encouraging the players to engage in downtime activities before heading off for Phandalin can help them get comfortable with the idea of dedicating nonadventuring time to personal and business development.

A few possible downtime activities are suggested below, but the party's downtime escapades can include anything that you and the players come up with.

#### The Orrery
Learning more about the mysterious orrery could be undertaken as basic research, which might lead later to a more thorough investigation with the scrutineering activity (see "*Franchise Tasks and Downtime*" in chapter 2). Whatever approach the characters take, remember that learning the full scope of the orrery's history, the secrets of its creator, and the range of its powers is the goal of the whole campaign. Whatever small bits of information can be revealed at the outset should hint at even more that remains to be discovered.

#### Dragonsitting
If the players helped Dabshabah, they might want to check up on the wyrmling. Helping her fully heal up and regain the use of her fire breath and sleep breath might require research or a customized use of the recuperating downtime activity (both from the *Player's Handbook*.) If the characters want to arrange for someone else to watch over the young dragon, finding a suitable guardian might require research. Or the characters might decide to sow positive rumors in the area where the dragon wants to settle (using the *sowing rumors* activity from the *Dungeon Master's Guide*), hoping to get the locals used to the idea.

#### Altared States
Characters interested in the strange altar under Waterdeep can undertake research to study its mysterious runes, which can lead to information regarding That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the "*New Race: Verdan*" section in chapter 3.) Gorkoh the goblin might assist with this task if the characters keep him around, as a kind of warm-up for the rules for letting NPCs run franchise tasks (which the characters will gain access to at the end of episode 2).

In the long term, Gorkoh could take the lead in the scrutineering activity to research the shrine, or set up a shady business practice to restore part of the altar's power and arrange clandestine tours into the caverns by those who want other dangerous relics destroyed. See "*Franchise Tasks and Downtime*" in chapter 2 for more information on those new activities.

## Continuing the Adventure
With contracts in hand and downtime done, the characters can make the trek from Waterdeep to Phandalin. *Episode 2* of this adventure details that trip and the new mysteries the characters encounter as they arrive in town, attempt to sort out what happened to the previous franchise—and start to build their own franchise as the newest members of Acquisitions Incorporated!

# Episode 2: Fun in Phandalin
![[051-04-11.png|right|300]]

In episode 2, Omin Dran sends the adventurers (now 2nd level) to Phandalin to learn the fate of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise that opened there a few months earlier but has recently gone dark. After overcoming hazards on the road, the characters enter the town. There, they learn that the franchise had signed an agreement to purchase the oft-ruined Tresendar Manor, a small estate on the outskirts of town. However, something catastrophic occurred at the manor recently, and no one in town has seen any of the occupants since.

While in Phandalin, the adventurers have the opportunity to interact with the townsfolk, possibly becoming involved in small-town dramas—including a mayoral election. Those events could have a significant impact on the franchise the characters will establish at the end of this episode.

At the ruins of Tresendar Manor, the characters find clues about what caused the destruction. They locate one of the two surviving members of the previous franchise, the half-orc majordomo **Gildha Duhn**. Gildha provides details about the attack and the apparent goal of those who struck the manor—retrieving a mysterious magic clockwork device that the characters recognize as part of the magic orrery found under Waterdeep. Investigating where the attackers slipped into the manor's basement and dungeon, the characters discover signs of recent rituals tapping into the power of the Far Realm—and take on the monsters the attackers left behind.

After dealing with the threats in the dungeon, the characters run into operatives from Dran Enterprises who have been sent to take control of the site. With the imminent dangers in and around Phandalin neutralized, the characters are rewarded by Head Office with the license to take over the failed Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. From there, they are set to investigate who was behind the attack on Acq Inc, and what connection the mysterious orrery might have to this new threat.

## Layers of Villainy
Although the characters have no way to discover this fact at present, the attack on Tresendar Manor was carried out by operatives working for the Six. That dark cabal of dark individuals wants to bring dark forces into the world—and its members have a specific motive of wanting to destroy Acquisitions Incorporated in the process. However, most of the agents involved in the attack had no idea they were working for the Six. All were hired individually and clandestinely by one of its members—the goblin **Splugoth the Returned**, who made no mention of his identity or allegiance.

The appearance of Dran Enterprises at the end of this episode is meant very much to imply that the organization was involved in the attack—and to distract the characters and the players alike from speculating on what other nefarious operators might be involved. The plots of the Six are revealed over the course of the adventure. More information on the Six, Splugoth, and Dran Enterprises can be found in "*Factions and Rivals*" in *chapter 3*, and in *appendix B*.

## Traveling to Phandalin
The trek from Waterdeep to Phandalin requires the adventurers to travel north on the High Road, then head east along the Triboar Trail before taking the track south into town. Walking at a normal pace, it takes about 6 days to travel from Waterdeep to the head of the Triboar Trail, 1 day to hike along the Triboar Trail to the track to Phandalin, then another 4 hours to reach the town.

#### Overland Adventuring
This first part of the episode features three encounters covering the journey from Waterdeep to Phandalin, all of which offer connections to the rest of the adventure. If you want your campaign to move at a quick pace, run only these encounters. In doing so, you don't have to worry about random encounters and setting up details of the journey such as who keeps watch when the characters camp.

If you prefer to emphasize the dangerous nature of the adventuring life for lower-level characters, random encounters can be used to create additional tension along the road. As characters gain levels and access to diverse powers, random wilderness encounters become less of a threat, so this is a great point in the campaign to use random encounters to challenge the party.

When using the Random Encounter table below, roll once for travel during the day and once while the characters are resting at night. Or if you see an encounter that tickles your fancy, just run it.

##### Random Encounters
| d10 + d10 | Encounter |
|:---:|---|
| 2 | Four **bullywugs** are looking for easy prey, and are quick to mistake the party for such. |
| 3 | A **unicorn** approaches the characters, searching for its friends (two **satyrs**) who became intoxicated and wandered off looking for trouble. |
| 4 | Four elf **scouts** search for an **ogre** that has been pillaging the area. The elves have lost the trail, but they warn the characters about the giant. |
| 5 | Four **adult myconids** hide among a patch of giant mushrooms. They are looking for two **myconid sprouts** that wandered too close to the trail. |
| 6 | Two **satyrs** (see above) stalk the party while intoxicated, looking to play pranks on travelers. |
| 7 | A **swarm of ravens** harasses the party. If offered food, the ravens never let the characters alone. |
| 8 | Six **goblins** demand a 10 gp toll. If Gorkoh is present, the adventurers might be able to talk the goblins out of a fight. |
| 9–11 | No encounter |
| 12 | Twenty-year-old young lovers Bertice (half-elf **commoner**) and Grovet (human **commoner**) are traveling from Phandalin to Waterdeep to start a life together. See Edermath Orchard in "Locations in Phandalin" later in this episode. |
| 13 | Two **giant wasps** dart from the woods, looking for a little fresh meat. |
| 14 | Four **boars** cross the path. The largest one has a gold necklace worth 50 gp wedged in its mouth, dangling from one tusk. |
| 15 | Two **dire wolves** chase eight pilgrims (**commoners**). If the adventurers drive the wolves off, the pilgrims offer 10 gp as thanks. |
| 16 | A locked box sits on the side of the road, having fallen off a wagon. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools unlocks the box, inside which are five *vials of holy water* and five *vials of antitoxin*. Smashing the box open works automatically but breaks 1d10 vials. |
| 17 | Two **draft horses** run free along the road. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can claim them. |
| 18 | A **swarm of poisonous snakes** has formed in the road. A successful DC 15 group Dexterity (Stealth) check allows the party to avoid the swarm. Otherwise, the swarm attacks. |
| 19 | An **archmage** named Guthildi gathers spell components in the forest off the road. If the adventurers treat the eccentric spellcaster well, she shares food and drink with them. If they treat her poorly, she teaches them a nonlethal lesson. |
| 20 | Kofutacti, a **young green dragon**, is touring the Sword Coast looking for trouble (see the "Life in Waterdeep" sidebar in episode 1). Thankfully for the characters, the dragon is a cowardly sort that prefers intimidation to combat, and which backs away from most fights. Kofutacti is the dragon who hunted Dabshabah in episode 1, which could be interesting if the brass wyrmling is with the party, or if the green dragon catches her scent on one of the characters if they've been in recent contact with her. |

#### Free-Market Lizardfolk
As the party skirts the Mere of Dead Men on the High Road, they come across a lizardfolk being intimidated and harassed by an unscrupulous Zhentarim merchant and his bodyguards.

>>This part of the High Road runs parallel to the Mere of Dead Men, a swamp full of dangers, pestilence, and death. Alongside the road, a lizardfolk is pleading with a male human dressed in black leather. Behind the dark figure, two bugbears stand with their morningstars drawn, staring at the lizardfolk with menace in their eyes.
>>
>>The human shouts loudly enough for you to hear. "Not acceptable! Friends, show this walking fish my displeasure."
>>
>>The lizardfolk starts to argue, saying, "I am not a fish. I am—" But the bugbears interrupt with the hafts of their weapons, knocking the wind out of the lizardfolk and driving it to its knees. The poor creature catches sight of your party, looking at all of you with a pleading expression.
>>

Rasqel, a Zhentarim-backed merchant (NE male human **bandit**), entered into a business agreement with this female **lizardfolk** named Thetsis, who is a leader of her tribe. The two **bugbears**, Jutt and Meff, act as Rasqel's muscle.

***Development.*** If the characters attempt to involve themselves in the altercation, Rasqel rudely orders them to go do things that are possible only during one of the less-restrained services in a temple of Loviatar. If the characters fail to leave after this warning, Rasqel gives them an ultimatum: they can walk away or face the wrath of the Zhentarim.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check can tell that Rasqel seems unsure about the bite behind his threat. His little operation is off the books, with no sanction from his superiors in the Black Network. The bugbear bodyguards know this fact too, and because of it, they are less than enthusiastic about working for Rasqel.

***Tactics.*** If the characters refuse to back down after the second warning, Rasqel orders the bugbears to attack while he hangs back. They obey reluctantly, but if it becomes clear that their lives are in danger at any point, or if the characters offer 10 gp or more to each of them, they walk away and leave their boss to his fate. Rasqel, who is indebted to bad people, fights to the death. If the situation looks grim for the adventurers, Thetsis enters the fray.

***Treasure.*** The bugbears carry nothing of value, as Rasqel has not paid them in several days. The bandit carries 25 gp in his belt pouch.

> ##### Business Opportunities
>The "Free-Market Lizardfolk" encounter is just one of the many business opportunities that mark a long-running Acquisitions Incorporated campaign. Forward-thinking adventurers can make a deal with Thetsis and her tribe that might help them corner the market on *potions of water breathing*. The terms of the deal are up to you, but it's best to start small. Once per month, the lizardfolk can meet the adventurers or their agents to sell them algae. As the characters start to hire franchise staff at the end of this episode, this is a perfect opportunity to set up how staff members can conduct franchise business with no direct involvement from the characters—at least not to start.
>
>These kinds of side ventures can easily expand to become adventures of their own. For example, one of the franchise NPCs handling the algae trade might fail to return from the Mere of Dead Men one day. The characters need to find out what happened if they want to keep employee morale from tanking—and to keep the business relationship with the lizardfolk intact. Choices must be made and consequences faced, which are the hallmarks of a great campaign.
>
>The "*Franchise Tasks and Downtime*" section in chapter 2 has more information about working ongoing business activities into the franchise's campaign story.
>

***Franchise Opportunity.*** If the characters aid her, Thetsis shares the story of her business arrangement with Rasqel. The bandit originally worked a fair deal with Thetsis and her lizardfolk tribe, whose members grow and harvest a nutrient-rich algae that is also a key ingredient for creating *potions of water breathing*. After earning the tribe's trust, Rasqel altered the terms of the deal in stages, starting by offering less money in a "slow market," then taking the algae with a promise to pay later, saying his cash flow was poor. When the lizardfolk began to balk at this arrangement, Rasqel threatened to send mercenaries to their home deep in the Mere of Dead Men, promising to destroy the tribe unless the lizardfolk worked for free. That threat was the cause of the altercation the characters witnessed.

The characters might easily recognize that this situation is a prime business opportunity. If not, suggest that realization to a character with a merchant-related background, or one who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check. Thetsis carries algae that she's willing to sell for 50 gp, but which is worth 100 gp in Waterdeep. More importantly, any character with herbalist or alchemist experience realizes that the algae can be mixed with other reagents costing 150 gp to make a *potion of water breathing*. Such a potion might fetch up to 500 gp in a city such as Waterdeep or Neverwinter.

#### The Wrongness
After turning east from the High Road onto the Triboar Trail, the characters' travel slows a bit. The High Road is frequently traveled by caravans, and so is better kept and easier to traverse. Triboar Trail, on the other hand, sees less frequent traffic and is less well maintained.

After a few hours' travel east, the adventurers come upon the following scene.

>>Sitting cross-legged in the middle of the road is an odd-looking figure wearing not a stitch of clothing. In one hand, he fiddles with a copper medallion etched with the image of a thin, tangled pair of antlers. He might be a beardless dwarf, or a short and pale half-orc, or a human with a gland condition. Either way, he doesn't look up as he speaks in a voice that sounds like a goat choking on sawdust.
>>
>>"Fortune has strange and wonderful and terrible things in store for you. So I am here as fortune's lackey. Fair or foul? Weal or woe? Chant or howl? Friend or foe?"
>>

This unfortunate wanderer is named Carkuss (N male human **priest**). A character who has an appropriate background or who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the copper medallion as a holy symbol of Beshaba. Known as the Lady of Misfortune, Beshaba is Tymora's twin sister and archenemy. This character knows that Beshaba sends her favored souls out into the world as a focus for bad luck and calamity, and that dealing with a favored soul of the Lady of Misfortune is a risky situation. Interacting with such agents in any way can draw Beshaba's ire, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

***The Hands of Fate.*** Now that Carkuss has crossed paths with the adventurers, they are stuck in the strands of his web of misfortune. To avoid the curse of Beshaba (see below), the characters must not harm Carkuss, they must not be overly kind to him, and they must correctly answer a riddle he asks. If successful on all three counts, each character earns a d10. Once before the character's next long rest, they can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. In addition, by earning Carkuss's favor, the characters might see him when they need good fortune later, if you so decide.

If the characters fail at any of these three tasks, one or more of them (at your determination) earns the curse. If the characters attack Carkuss, he doesn't defend himself, hoping that they slay his miserable form so his soul can be free.

***The Riddle.*** After initial interactions with the characters, Carkuss asks the following riddle:

*I stand aloof, alone as a savior*.

*I shine my oily smile across the rippling vastness*.

*I, with this beaming, attract and repel*.

*Ignore me, and you are lost, one way or another*.

*What am I*?

The answer is a lighthouse—a foreshadowing on behalf of fate of where the characters will go in *episode 3*.

***Curse of Beshaba.*** Beshaba inflicts her curse upon any cleric character who doesn't worship her, or the character who has the most interaction with Carkuss. She might target more than one character, especially anyone who worships Tymora. While under the curse, a character has disadvantage on saving throws. The subject knows the curse can be ended with *remove curse* or similar magic, or it can be passed to another person.

To pass the curse, the victim can choose a living humanoid within 5 feet of it once per day, making a Charisma check contested by the target's Charisma check. If the cursed victim wins, the curse transfers to the new target. If unsuccessful in transferring the curse, the victim takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage. A target who resists the transfer is immune to the curse of Beshaba for one year. Passing the curse on to an innocent person is an evil act.

An NPC victim of the curse has a chance to die of a terminal case of bad luck. For each day that passes, roll a d20 and a d12. If both dice show a 1, the NPC dies in a freak accident. The curse is gone, but if word of the death reaches the character who transferred the curse, the consequences might live on.

#### A Horse Is a Corpse, of Course
When the characters move off the Triboar Trail and onto the even-less-used track to Phandalin, they stumble into what looks like a by-the-numbers goblin ambush that turns into something much more bizarre. After an hour's travel, the characters come upon the following scene.

>>Ahead on the rough road, a pair of dead horses and an overturned cart block your way. Sacks and barrels spilled from the cart litter the ground. Trees grow close to the road here, and the thick undergrowth obscures the view beyond.
>>

As the characters approach within 50 feet, any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that several goblins stand motionless in the underbrush, while several more perch in the trees. A character who succeeds on the check by 5 or more also notices that these goblins are dead, as does any character who attacks or attempts to interact with them. A closer investigation then reveals that they have been propped up and tied into their positions.

***Creatures.*** The two dead horses are **warhorse skeletons** whose remaining flesh sloughs off as they fight. When any character comes within 20 feet of the fallen horses, these undead lurch to their feet and attack. When this happens, each character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or be surprised.

***Tactics.*** The gnome archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop animated these dead horses in the aftermath of the attack on Tresendar Manor, commanding them to lie still and attack any humanoid creatures that approach them.

![[052-04-12.png|right|300]]

***Hoobur's Mark.*** If the characters poke around the rotting flesh that fell of the horses during the battle, they see that each horse bore scars on its sides that form the image of a draconic skull with a sword driven up through it from the bottom. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes the sigil as part of a unique necromantic ritual that can turn any creature into an undead creature when it dies. (The characters will see this rune and this magic again later. See the sidebar "The Magic of Convenience" below for more information.)

***Treasure.*** Most of the crates, sacks, and barrels that litter the road and the wagon have already been emptied of valuables. One cask of Luskan Ice Mead remains intact among the looted goods, worth 50 gp in Phandalin. Alternatively, the characters can get 200 gp for it in Waterdeep, where patrons won't realize that ice mead is just normal mead in Luskan.

> ##### The Magic of Convenience
>The work of the gnome archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop is a constant presence in episodes 2 and 3 of the adventure, even before his actual appearance toward the end of *episode 3*. Savvy players might note that the undead minions Hoobur creates to harry the party don't follow the standard rules by which a spellcaster character might create undead. Likewise, some of the creatures working for Hoobur do so in ways that aren't covered by *dominate monster*.
>
>If the characters develop a strong interest in creating undead horses or summoning will-o'-wisps to their service, you can decide to reveal the "unique rituals" Hoobur knows, which can show up as treasure in the adventure or be something that the characters can learn through research. Otherwise, just assume that like many classic villains, Hoobur Gran'Shoop has access to whatever magic is necessary to advance the plot in the most interesting way.

## Arrival in Phandalin
After a harrowing and potentially lucrative journey, the characters arrive in Phandalin. Map 2.1 shows the layout of the small town, with key locations described in the sections below.

Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:

>>This modest-sized town is comprised of some fifty buildings, most of which show signs of regular upkeep. Farms and an apple orchard mark the outer edge of town, with houses and shops closer in. Townsfolk are milling about in the central square and on the adjacent green. Two people stand on a stage on the green, addressing the crowd, but the distance to them—along with a steady chorus of cheers, boos, and shouts—obscures what's being said.
>>
>>Rising from a small hill overlooking the town is an old manor house—or at least it was an old manor house. Most of its walls have collapsed in what appears to be a recent disaster, with traces of smoke still rising from piles of tumbled stone.
>>

When the characters approach the stage or try to slip away, continue:

>>A portly, well-dressed male human on the stage points unexpectedly at your group and shouts. "You see? This is exactly what I mean! Just when things start to calm down in Phandalin, more murderous vagrants show up. They probably have something to do with what's happened to Tresendar Manor, and with the livestock that have started going missing! And it's only a matter of time before this all ends in misery and bloodshed, I promise you!"
>>

***Politics in Phandalin.*** Phandalin was long run by an elected townmaster, until trouble with bandits some years ago saw the townmaster replaced by a council of three prominent citizens, elected every two years. However, the recent abdication of one councilor and the town's growing size have prompted the townsfolk to decide that it's time to expand the council to five persons, and to incorporate a mayorship to handle increasingly important decisions about Phandalin's future.

Two people, both current councilors, are running for mayor. One is Harbin Wester, a male human with the integrity and unctuous personality of... well, a career politician. Wester is a former townmaster, and is running against Sildar Hallwinter, a male human, member of the Lords' Alliance, and former adventurer. Hallwinter is a circumspect sort who opposes Wester mostly because of the latter's corruption. For more information on both, see the "People of Phandalin" section.

Wester is the town's banker and a major landowner, so some consider his wealth and power to be ample justification for his greedy, conniving nature. More importantly, a number of monstrous and magical incidents in the area over many years have left Phandalin's citizens anxious for strong-sounding leadership. Even though adventurers solved many of the town's problems in the past, Wester has gained much popularity by convincing people that the town's troubles would have never surfaced if those well-armed wandering busybodies hadn't gotten involved in the first place. The banker has even gone so far as to suggest that adventurers might have orchestrated some of Phandalin's past woes for their own gain.

Sildar Hallwinter isn't a great orator. He spends most of his time refuting Wester's "unsubstantiated claims." The retired warrior also points out that Phandalin needs a leader who knows the dangers of the wilderness, even as its people need a mayor unburdened by scandal and potential conflicts of interest.

The characters can become involved in the mayoral debate if the players wish. If they don't, wrap it up and let the characters interact with the townsfolk as they see fit. Talking to any townsfolk yields up the information detailed in the "Recent Events in Phandalin" and "People of Phandalin" sections, below.

![[053-map-2-1-dm.jpg|right|300]]

## Recent Events in Phandalin
The Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise previously established in Phandalin. When that group arrived in town a few months ago, they spoke with Harbin Wester about acquiring the ruined Tresendar Manor, since the banker held the property's title. Wester worked out terms with Head Office and the deal was signed. The members of the franchise soon got to work on restoring the manor, frequently coming to town for supplies. When not slipping off to adventure for a few days here and there, most of their time was spent at the manor.

A number of days ago (the same day the franchise's payment was due to Head Office), the townsfolk heard explosions from the manor, with a few people reporting seeing gouts of flame and hearing the commotion of a battle. No one was really keen to investigate, wanting to avoid any trouble that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had brought on themselves. (Adventurers, right?) But after a few days passed and no one from the manor came into town, Sildar Hallwinter braved the walk up the hill to investigate.

Where the manor once stood, he found only rubble, scorch marks, ruined construction, and bloodstains. He failed to discover the single franchisee left alive in the manor, who was unconscious at the time. The townsfolk have given the ruins a wide berth since then, not wanting to risk awakening whatever mad magic delivered the adventurers of the Golden Mongoose to their final fate.

*When scouting a base of operations, consider how many of the local businesses in your area could be strong-armed into submission, or how many of the politicians could be replaced by a member of your own implausibly large family.*— Rosie Beestinger
## Plots of the Six
Just over a year ago, operatives of the Six came across one of the components of the *Orrery of the Wanderer*—the *far gear*. Quickly realizing the potential power in the component and the orrery it was a part of, they began to scour the Sword Coast for information regarding the artifact. A month ago, their intelligence-gathering resources turned up word that two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises—including the newly minted Phandalin franchise—had been scrutineering for lore about mysterious magic clockwork devices. Wanting to determine what Acquisitions Incorporated might know about the orrery, the leaders of the Six put a plan into motion. (The second franchise was based on the Sword Coast between Neverwinter and Luskan. Its fate will be discovered by the characters in *episode 3*.)

The Six set up an agent in Phandalin—Ditch Fundi, who first raised and now runs Phandalin's new Temple of the Coin Maiden. Using Ditch's intelligence on the activities of the Company of the Golden Mongoose, the Six confirmed that the franchise held an orrery component called the *timepiece of travel*—and that Acq Inc head office was so far in the dark about their discovery. So the Six hired a number of agents—including archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop—to attack both franchises.

Hoobur's forces snuck into Phandalin and razed Tresendar Manor to the ground. However, the Six operatives were unable to find the *timepiece of travel*. Knowing that one of the franchisees had teleported away from the fight, the agents assumed that the orrery component was gone. Unknown to them, the timepiece stayed behind, and remains in the possession of the survivor still buried alive in the rubble.

Only two of the townsfolk have any information regarding the attack on Tresendar Manor. Ditch Fundi, a charlatan priest of Waukeen and agent of the Six, was installed in Phandalin a month ago to watch the franchise's activities and set up the attack. At the same time, Sister Garaele of Tymora works for Dran Enterprises, and has previously fed much information on the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose to her bosses. She knows no details of the attack, assuming that the Golden Mongoose adventurers either blew themselves up or summoned a monster they couldn't control. But she knows that Dran Enterprises is sending a team to clean up the mess and claim the manor. For more on these two, see the "People of Phandalin" section.

## People of Phandalin
After the characters arrive in town and get involved in the mayoral debate (or don't), they can take the opportunity to interact with the townsfolk. With the destruction of Tresendar Manor still the talk of the town, the characters have no problem finding people with opinions on the fate of the previous Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.

The information presented in the "Recent Events in Phandalin" section can guide the NPCs' responses to the characters' questions. But beyond being sources of information, many of the NPCs in this episode have the potential to interact with the characters as allies, foes, or potential employees when their franchise comes together at the end of the episode. You should feel free to add your own NPCs as well, or change the ones provided to better fit the story you want to create with your players.

> ##### Have We Been Here Before?
>The town of Phandalin will be recognizable to any players familiar with the *Lost Mine of Phandelver* adventure. This version of Phandalin is set five years or so after that adventure, making use of many of the original Phandalin locations and NPCs even as it adds new places and new characters to the mix. If you have your own version of Phandalin in your campaign, make any adjustments necessary to this episode for continuity.
>

#### Brawn McGable
Brawn (N male human **bandit**) is a middle-aged former member of the Redbrand Ruffians, a bandit gang that did their best to set up a reign of terror in Phandalin some years ago. Brawn came very late to the Redbrands' operation, and thus did only a little intimidation work with the locals before adventurers defeated the bandits and cleared their hideout in the dungeon of Tresendar Manor. He served a sentence on a work gang for his involvement with the bandits, but his affable personality won over many in town by the time of his release. He thus stayed on in Phandalin, where he works doing odd jobs and keeping a close eye on local goings-on.

![[054-04-14.png|right|300]]

***Development.*** Brawn knows a great deal about Tresendar Manor, including the location and layout of its dungeon. Characters who talk to him about his past can learn a few details of the entrance to the dungeons (see "Tresendar Manor" below). If effective roleplaying or ability checks get the characters on Brawn's good side, he can be convinced to provide further details of the layout of dungeon areas 1 through 8. However, he knows nothing about what the Golden Mongoose adventurers (and the agents of the Six) might have done to alter the features of the dungeon as he remembers it.

Over and above his general utility in a fight, Brawn has a way with people, a winning smile, and a sharp tongue. If the characters look at him as a potential employee, he makes a good retainer for the franchise, picking up or dropping off goods, making deals, or entertaining potential partners. If he joins the franchise and the characters encourage him, you might eventually upgrade him to use the stat block of a **spy**.

#### Ditch Fundi
A gnome named Ditch Fundi (LE female gnome **assassin**) runs the Temple of the Coin Maiden with the help of two female human **acolytes**, Hesten Jenz and Mischka Solmen. The two acolytes hold regular services, preach the gospel of Waukeen, and have gained the trust and favor of most of the townsfolk in the month the temple has been open. Ditch stays removed from public interactions, instead looking after the financial welfare of the temple.

***Development.*** Ditch is an operative of the Six, planted in Phandalin a month ago to watch the Company of the Golden Mongoose—then to destroy the franchise when the time was right. She knows just enough about the teachings of Waukeen to talk a good game. The gnome does nothing to tip her hand, acting friendly toward the characters for as long as possible. However, if she ever maneuvers them into a position where she can easily destroy them, she does so.

The acolytes know nothing of Ditch's treachery, assuming that her allowing them to take responsibility for temple services is a sign of her trust and their own ability. They defend her unless they learn the truth.

*Phandalin... Phandalin. Yeah, I know it. Temperate climate. Average rainfall eighteen inches per annum. Take that, Mrs. Brinbury! Give me a C+ in geography. Ha.What? Oh, yeah, yeah. Phandalin. Quaint place. Full of rustic charm. Primary industries include... gods, I don't know. Rocks and sheep? Oh, and a couple of very private festhalls. I can't tell you the number of times...Wait, why are you writing this down? Did Dran send you? Well... I'm on my lunch break! Yes, I know what time it is! It's gin o'clock!*— Viari
#### Harbin Wester
Harbin Wester (N male human **noble**) knows only greed, power, and treachery. He is the wealthiest citizen in Phandalin, owning much of the land, many of the businesses, and a good portion of the wealth in the local area. He was the last townmaster before that position was dissolved in favor of a three-person town council, and has been a member of that council from its inception to the present day.

Wester is friendly until it suits him to be otherwise, so most locals don't think ill of him. However, he is more than capable of stabbing people in the back while keeping a fake grin on his face. He is cunning in the ways of business, knowing exactly who to bribe or threaten to get what he wants, but he's careful to keep most dealings aboveboard and "legal" so that no one can claim to have been treated unfairly.

***Development.*** Even after pointing the characters out as "murderous vagrants" during the debate, Wester tries to be the first person to talk to them in private. Laughing off his claims as "political rhetoric," he offers to buy drinks and asks to hear the group's stories.

Harbin Wester is intended to be a political adversary. He invites the characters to explore the manor if they desire, reminding them that he still owns the place. He also tries to get the best of the characters, offering money, land, goods, or services to place them in his debt. Once this is done, he calls in those debts whenever it's convenient—and is not above asking the group to undertake morally questionable tasks as payment.

Wester never puts himself in a position where his foes can kill him without severe consequences. Several bodyguards (use the **thug** stat block) always watch over him. He also has extensive contacts and investments in Waterdeep and Neverwinter. With a message to either city, he can call in a large force of skilled mercenaries (**veterans**) to his aid.

![[055-04-15.png|right|300]]

#### Macklin Talctuft
Macklin (N dwarf **bandit**) is a young wanderer who came to Phandalin expecting to secure a job mining in the nearby hills. Once they arrived, the dwarf found no mining work to be had, and the jobs they've taken to make ends meet were terribly boring. Macklin has thus been draining their savings looking for any employment that inspires them. So far, nothing has fit the bill. Macklin wears their hair and beard in a mohawk style that underlines their general disinterest in tradition.

***Development.*** Macklin had been preparing to seek employment with the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose before the disaster that leveled Tresendar Manor. If the characters take possession of the place, the young dwarf marches up to them and offers to oversee the reconstruction. Macklin is reliable and creative once their mind is engaged in a project. However, as an overseer, they are difficult to please, and other franchise employees or casual workers might come to resent their drive for perfection.

If Macklin joins the franchise and has the opportunity to do field work or adventuring, you might consider upgrading them to use the stat block of a **berserker**.

![[056-04-16.png|right|300]]

#### Minghee Graywind
Linene Graywind is the owner and operator of the Lionshield Coster (see the "Locations in Phandalin" section). Her daughter Minghee (NG female human **commoner**) knows that her mother expects her to take over the business in a few years—and she wants nothing to do with it. Minghee wants to travel, see the world, and make a name for herself, settling down only when she's ready. She works at the coster reluctantly, and tells anyone who'll listen how she wants to get away and do something different with her life.

***Development.*** Minghee is quite outgoing, and she engages the characters excitedly the first time they visit the Lionshield Coster (or she seeks them out elsewhere if they don't). If the characters set up a franchise in Phandalin, she offers to be their roving representative, procuring goods and services from wherever the characters want to send her. Minghee has a great mind for numbers and a strong head for business, but if the characters take her into their franchise, she becomes restless if denied a regular chance to travel. In the long term, Minghee has the drive and instinct to pick up spellcasting (and use a new stat block of your choice) if any spellcasting character takes the time to mentor her.

If the characters take Minghee into their employ, Linene is heartbroken at first, but she soon sees the value in having her daughter working for an up-and-coming franchise. Opportunities might arise for the franchise to enter into an ongoing business arrangement with the Lionshield Coster—which might in turn raise the ire of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner's Exchange (see below) if the coster's success threatens Sharna's own plans for economic domination.

#### Sharna Quirstiron
Sharna Quirstiron is the feisty dwarf overseer of the Phandalin Miner's Exchange. She took over that position after the former overseer (and third member of the town council) Halia Thornton left Phandalin "to seek other opportunities." All the locals know that continual problems at nearby mines made Halia's job difficult, with little to no wealth coming into the exchange for months at a time. Unfortunately for Halia, the downturn in the mining industry was the least of her worries. The Manshoon sect of the Zhentarim saw an opportunity in Phandalin and had Halia killed. Sharna (LE female dwarf **bandit captain**) is the sect's agent. She aims to revive mining in the area, with the goal of making Phandalin a haven for the rogue faction of the Zhentarim.

***Development.*** Sharna is thoroughly evil, but she's a fine actor. She has the economic interests of Phandalin at heart, but only because she hopes to have a prosperous town at her mercy when the needs of the Zhentarim become her focus. She ingratiates herself to the characters, hiring them to clear out monsters in the local area that threaten mining interests. She offers to partner up on business deals, sharing the profits of the mines if the characters invest their time or money in such operations. If the characters end up on the wrong side of Harbin Wester, she sides with them against the banker, concealing her goal of usurping his wealth and power. She encourages the characters to actively oppose Wester—or even to kill him if she thinks they might be amenable to the idea.

Sharna is a formidable combatant compared to most folk in Phandalin. She also keeps four bodyguards (**thugs**) on hand to guard the exchange, travel to the mines, rough up "uncooperative" people, or do the dark deeds she needs done to meet her objectives.

#### Sildar Hallwinter
Sildar (NG male human **knight**) is a retired adventurer and Griffon Rider of Waterdeep. Some years ago, he worked in the employ of the Rockseeker family, who had hoped to reopen mines in the hills and mountains surrounding Phandalin. After nearly being killed in a goblin ambush while traveling to Phandalin for the first time, Sildar's faith in himself was shaken. The Rockseeker family moved on after their troubled dealings in the town, but Sildar stuck around.

Although he is getting on in years, Sildar still trains with his weapons and keeps himself in shape. He was one of the town's three councilors prior to (as he puts it), "Halia Thornton leaving without even saying goodbye." By running for mayor against Harbin Wester, Sildar hopes to help Phandalin increase its prosperity—and to put that prosperity into everyone's pockets, not just Wester's. What he lacks in charisma, he makes up for in sincerity.

***Development.*** Sildar is a member of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied leaders concerned with the security and prosperity of the North. As such, his goals are to bring stability and wealth to the region. He is brave and honest, but nearly losing his life years before caused him to doubt not only his martial skills but also his decision making. He could prove to be a valuable ally to the characters, especially if he's elected mayor. However, he might also frustrate them with his passivity and indecisiveness—or allow them to take advantage of those same qualities to wield great influence over him.

> ##### Politics and Adventuring
>An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign works best when it's running on many levels at once. One of those levels is the business aspects of the characters' lives, with satire another obvious side of the campaign. But politics can be another driving force in an Acq Inc story, as can the satirical treatment of people in power.
>
>The political maneuverings taking place in Phandalin will inevitably have an impact on the characters and their franchise. Still, if the players aren't interested in the political aspect of the campaign story, don't worry about it. Wester is elected mayor, the players can play nice with him to get what they want, and the story moves forward. But if the characters care about who becomes mayor, they have plenty of opportunity to influence the outcome.
>
>Sildar Hallwinter cares about the good of the town but is wishy-washy. His lack of charisma hurts his chances for election. But a clever group of adventurers working behind the scenes might be just what Hallwinter needs to energize his campaign. On the other hand, Harbin Wester controls much of the wealth in Phandalin, including Tresendar Manor. As such, helping Wester get elected—or at least not being too obvious about opposing him—can put the characters on his good side. Even if Wester loses the election, his power and wealth mean that the characters will be interacting with him—and dealing with his ability to make their lives easier or harder—whether they want to or not.
>
>Another possibility is that one of the characters could run for office as a last-minute wild-card candidate. A stranger wandering into Phandalin is unlikely to gain the trust of enough citizens to win the race, and the need to stick around town and run things will eventually get in the way of the characters venturing all over the North being heroic. But don't discount the narrative possibilities involved in the characters embracing the political side of the story even more wholeheartedly than you expect them to.
>

#### Sister Garaele
Sister Garaele (CG female elf **priest**) was a zealous and enthusiastic servant in Phandalin's Shrine of Luck before Ditch Fundi, "the competition," arrived in town a month ago. Now, she is downright frenetic. She proselytizes for Tymora in the streets, in taverns, and in people's homes. Garaele is well known for haranguing the folk of Phandalin, claiming that the misfortune of previous years has been due to a lack of devotion to Tymora. Despite this, most locals like the priest, and are likely to help her if she's in trouble.

***Development.*** Garaele was once an agent of the Harpers, though she has recently broken ties with that group of agents opposing the abuse of power. Since then, she has taken significant donations from Dran Enterprises, whose agents asked her to keep an eye on the members of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose and any other Acquisitions Incorporated operatives in Phandalin. Garaele is happy to pass this information along in exchange for Dran Enterprises' payments to the temple, and she asks no questions about that organization's long-term goals for the town. She is a good person, however, so she won't knowingly allow harm to befall others. She is helpful to anyone willing to offer wealth, goods, or services to her shrine.

#### Stuuzant
Though not exactly people and no longer in Phandalin, a neutral **ogre** named Stuuzant is another potential source of information for the characters. She was one of the operatives used by the Six in the attack on Tresendar Manor, smashing her way through the site's walls. When the attack was over, the ogre wandered away. However, she decided to stick around the area to enjoy her proximity to lots of tasty livestock, even as she keeps her distance from anyone who might pester her.

In the days since the destruction of the manor, farmers and herders on the outskirts of Phandalin have reported seeing giant-sized footprints, both humanoid and canine, as well as missing animals. No one has spotted Stuuzant, as the ogre has good instincts for avoiding trouble. She keeps moving, hiding until the time is right to strike. When she attacks livestock, she does so when no one can see her, and she takes only what she needs to survive.

***Development.*** Characters might be asked to look into the missing livestock, or they can do so on their own to get on the good side of the locals. Investigating the disappearances might be used to angle for something the characters want or need, such as supplies, a lower price on Tresendar Manor, citizens favoring one mayoral candidate over another, or whatever else you can think of.

Tracking down and defeating Stuuzant is no easy task, however. She is friends with a pair of **dire wolves**, and is mostly successful at covering her tracks after her raids. The ogre also has yet to establish a den in the area, so she rarely stays in one place for more than a day.

If the characters locate her, Stuuzant speaks Common quite well, uses smarter tactics than a typical ogre, and tries to bargain with the characters if it looks like they might defeat her. If questioned, she tells the story of being hired to attack the manor. A goblin in hooded robes paid her to help break into the estate and smash everything in sight. Stuuzant never saw the goblin's face, and knows nothing about the Six (which was never mentioned to her or any of the other hirelings).

Savvy characters might convince Stuuzant to take a position in their franchise, with the ogre making a great sentry or bodyguard. However, the townspeople might need assurances to accept such a creature living so close to their town.

***Treasure.*** Stuuzant carries the 50 gp she was paid to help attack the manor.

## Locations in Phandalin
As they explore Phandalin—and eventually set up their franchise in the town—the characters can engage with many of the town's businesses, whether as patrons or potential partners. The most prominent of the town's locations (as well as a few additional NPCs) are detailed in this section. You can come up with details for additional locations and NPCs based on the needs and desires of your players.

#### Edermath Orchard
The apple trees of Edermath Orchard surround a small group of buildings on the edge of town. The smell of fruit is strong around the orchard year round, with the apples grown and picked here processed throughout the winter into juice, cider, and other products.

Daran Edermath (NG male elf **scout**) established the orchard many years before. A former adventurer and one of the oldest people in Phandalin, he remains aloof from town politics and focuses his interest on the traveling merchants and food-related businesses in Phandalin that buy his wares. Daran employs down-and-out miners to do odd jobs and help during harvest, so he's popular among the town's working folk.

***Development.*** Daran's half-elf daughter Bertice went missing the day before the destruction at Tresendar Manor, and he is beginning to fear for her. Most folk in town know that Bertice recently took up with a human miner named Grovet, who is also missing. If the characters met the couple on the road (see the "Random Encounters" table earlier in this episode), they can allay at least some of Daran's fears for his daughter's safety.

Earning Daran's full trust is a long-term proposition, and the characters must prove themselves beyond reproach in any dealings with the orchardist. If they do, however, the elf proves a valuable ally. He has more resources and power in town than his humble orchard might suggest. And as a member of the Order of the Gauntlet—an association of vigilant adventurers that seeks to overthrow evil—Edermath has the ear of powerful people up and down the Sword Coast.

#### Lionshield Coster
The Lionshield Coster is a trading post and competitor to the Phandalin Miners' Exchange. A weathered sign hanging above the front door depicts a blue lion painted on a wooden shield. Linene Graywind (NG female human **commoner**) manages the store, which is one of a chain of mercantile outposts spread up and down the Sword Coast. Mother to Minghee (see "People of Phandalin" above), Linene works tirelessly to keep the coster operational through good times and bad.

Most of the goods in the *Player's Handbook* can be purchased here. Linene can special order items for delivery in a few days (with a deposit, of course). However, she doesn't buy, procure, or sell morally questionable goods.

#### Phandalin Miners' Exchange
This trading post once acted as the central hub for mining activity in the area, as well as the authority for maintaining public records. A two-story building, the exchange bears a newly painted sign depicting two crossed pickaxes above a lump of gold. The first story is where business is conducted, while the second story contains living quarters.

As with the Lionshield Coster, most of the goods available in the *Player's Handbook* can be purchased here. Mining gear is also easily had—as are illicit goods, with Sharna Quirstiron's dispensation (see "People of Phandalin").

#### Shrine of Luck
Until a month ago, this temple to Tymora was the only shrine in town. With the Temple of the Coinmaiden (see below) newly established, Sister Garaele, the local priestess, works harder each day to keep the attention of the faithful of Phandalin. See "People of Phandalin" for more information on Sister Garaele.

#### Sleeping Giant
This single-story tavern's better days have seen better days. Its weathered sign probably depicts a prone giant, but whatever paint or carvings once adorned the sign have been all but worn away. Inside, the place shows the same lack of care. It's dirty, ill kept, and in need of a thorough cleaning. Or burning.

The place is normally occupied by dwarf and human miners, either back from a stretch in the mines or waiting for a mine to reopen. They are not overtly hostile unless provoked, but it doesn't take much to provoke this unhappy lot. The owner and barkeep is Grista Kettlecopp (N female dwarf **commoner**). Surly to the point of rudeness, she tries to run her business her own way and stay out of the political and personal affairs of other townsfolk.

***Development.*** The miners that frequent the Sleeping Giant are a rough lot, and could become a competent and formidable force if stirred up and pointed at a target. Currently, Sharna at the Miner's Exchange has their trust (see "People of Phandalin"), mostly for her assurances that the mines will soon be more prosperous than ever. If Sharna discovers that the characters are interfering with her and the Zhentarim's plans, she need only tell the miners that the characters are standing in the way of their gainful employment to inspire them to use their pickaxes for something other than mining. On the other hand, characters who earn the miners' good will can end up with numerous allies in Phandalin.

#### Smithy
This building contains an open area with a forge and several anvils, but the rest of the structure is closed off. Maza Fieldsalder (N female human **commoner**) took over the smithy a year ago, after the death of her master, Alger Frakk. As the master smith's apprentice, the powerfully built young woman earned her new position through hard work and talent, and she is well liked among the other townsfolk.

***Development.*** Among the few people in town who are wary of Maza are those who question the nature of Alger's death—including a few malcontents who whisper that perhaps the young smith had a compelling reason to kill her master. Whether these rumors hold truth or are just the ramblings of a would-be ironworker who wants Maza's job is up to you.

#### Stonehill Inn
The Stonehill Inn is one of the largest buildings in town. The business is run by Trilena and Toblen Stonehill, assisted by their twelve-year-old son, Pip. (All are human **commoners**.) The Stonehills have comfortably weathered the changeable times in Phandalin since building the inn more than five years ago. The six-bedroom complex is tidy and clean, the table fare is good, and the company is pleasant.

***Development.*** The Stonehills are unwitting soldiers in the war for power in Phandalin. Although they own and operate their business, they owe a small amount of money to Harbin Wester. The banker wants to take their business, and he keeps an eye out for any opportunity to gain the necessary leverage. He might use the characters to lean on the Stonehills if they end up owing him favors. Alternatively, if the characters befriend the Stonehills, they might become staunch allies in the family's attempts to keep Wester's hands off their business.

> ##### Property and Law
>Many fantasy campaigns either ignore questions of law or utilize benevolent authoritarian figures to oversee social and economic justice—the wise monarch, the enlightened town council, the Masked Lords, and so forth. This method means that the law is stable. Higher authorities can be consulted on matters requiring arbitration, with concrete edicts handed down to make the line between right and wrong—in a civil sense, at least—crystal clear.
>
>In Phandalin (as with many of the other locations in this adventure), the situation is not that simple. No king or council owns the lands of or around the town. Eminent domain is neither implied nor accepted. In most of the smaller settlements along the Sword Coast, the person with power is the individual who takes and holds that power. Locales still have authorities and laws, but the person who can kill everyone else—or pay someone to do so—is the one who truly rules.
>
>In Phandalin, Harbin Wester is that person. Even if he loses the mayoral election, his monetary resources far outstrip those of anyone else in the town, leaving him in a position of strong economic control. However, part of Wester's power derives from subtlety. He is wary enough to watch out for anyone with the ability to effectively oppose him, and savvy enough to make sure that such people never have any reason to oppose him. As such, when the characters clean out Tresendar Manor and attempt to use it as the base for their new franchise, a potential for social and economic conflict arises.
>
>Wester holds the mortgage on the manor. The legal entity that was the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the signatory to that mortgage, and unfortunately for Acquisitions Incorporated, the mortgage is now in arrears. The characters can work a deal to take over those payments, but the terms are steep. Fortunately, after the manor is cleared, Head Office is willing to negotiate for the manor's deed. (See the "Conclusion" section of this episode for more information.) This leaves Harbin Wester bitter, as he recognizes that having the favor of Acq Inc backing them up gives the characters more potential power in Phandalin than he likes.
>
>As the rest of the campaign plays out, keep track of how Wester might try to take advantage of the characters and their deal. What if operatives of Dran Enterprises or representatives of the Six come to him? More importantly, if the characters directly oppose Wester and bring him low, what happens if a worse power steps in to take his place? The options are limitless. Do what challenges and entertains your players most!

#### Temple of the Coinmaiden
Half a year past, another general store in Phandalin called Barthen's Provisions went out of business. The building was purchased a month ago for the church of Waukeen by an unknown benefactor, and quickly renovated with all the fineries necessary to draw the attention of the goddess of wealth. The gnome Ditch Fundi oversaw the temple's construction and dedication, and she now runs it in Waukeen's name. (In truth, the benefactor who built the temple is the Six, and Ditch Fundi is their agent. See her entry in "People of Phandalin" for more information.)

#### Town Council Hall
This one-story hall is the closest thing the people of Phandalin have to a government building. Long used as the town council's meeting room and the townmaster's hall before that, it is set to be expanded to include the new mayor's office after the election. As the two remaining members of the town council, Sildar Hallwinter and Harbin Wester currently share office space here.

## Tresendar Manor
After the characters have met some of the locals and heard what's known about the events at Tresendar Manor and the disappearance of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose, they can investigate the fallen manor and the dungeons beneath it. Once a small but elegant estate, the ruined building sits upon a hill overlooking Phandalin. Years of neglect had already done considerable damage to the structure, only some of which the Golden Mongoose adventurers had restored. But the recent attacks undid all that work, pulling most of the above-ground structure down.

> ##### Level Inappropriate
>"The Orrery of the Wanderer" makes use of an adventure trope as old as D&D itself—working up a totally high-powered artifact, then dropping it into the hands of low-level characters just to see what happens. The orrery and its six components are presented in *appendix D*, and the powers of these relics are significant. But the fact that the orrery is an artifact in a some-assembly-required state gives you a lot of latitude in determining how you dole those powers out.
>
>The orrery's components are set up so that their magic gets weird while the orrery is in pieces. At your determination, that magic might act in unpredictable ways, not recharge as often as normal, or add random effects to keep the characters on their toes. One aspect of this unpredictability comes into play in the adventure when the tiefling Talanatha uses the *timepiece of travel* to escape from the attack on Tresendar Manor, only to have the timepiece stay behind (see later on in this episode for details).
>
>By making sure the characters understand the unpredictable nature of the components' magic, you give them good incentive to be cautious about using them. And if the power of the components threatens to derail parts of the adventure (for example, if the characters plan on using the *timepiece of travel* to teleport everywhere and find every secret location in the scenario), feel free to have the power of individual components mysteriously fail until they are all installed in the orrery housing once more.
>

#### The Ruins
When the characters reach the top of the hill and get a closer look at the ruins of Tresendar Manor, read the following:

>>Many of the crumbled walls of the manor show signs of having been recently rebuilt, but even that newer stonework has been toppled and smashed, coating everything in the area with a thick layer of dust. Temporary structures seemingly set up to aid the reconstruction have been badly damaged by force and fire, though a couple of wooden buildings still stand amid the destruction.
>>

As the characters draw closer, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) check reveals that the fire damage isn't natural, and that magic was likely involved. The same successful check allows a character to intuit that the stonework was not smashed by weapons or tools, suggesting that a creature of great size and strength took part in the destruction.

Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear the jackals in the central courtyard of the manor before the group approaches that area.

#### Jackal and Hide
As the characters enter the ruined courtyard of Tresendar Manor, they find they are not alone.

>>Numerous brown-and-gray jackals prowl the ruins. Some gnaw on bones, while others sniff and dig at a pile of stones at the center of the manor courtyard. In response to your approach, the nearest jackals turn toward you and snarl.
>>

***Creatures.*** A **jackalwere** called Hamebi leads a pack of ten **jackals** searching the ruins for survivors and treasure. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check after the fight starts notices that one of the jackals (Hamebi in animal form) wears a satchel slung across its back.

***Tactics.*** Hamebi stays in jackal form, using her Sleep Gaze on the toughest-looking adventurer. If that target falls unconscious, three jackals quickly swarm the character. Hamebi flees if it looks like the characters might defeat her. She orders her jackals to cover her retreat, but they follow her lead the next round. She surrenders if she faces death with no way to escape.

***Development.*** Hamebi works for the Six, although she doesn't know it. If captured, she can relate that a short, cloaked humanoid came to her in Neverwinter Wood two days ago, hiring her to bring her pack of jackals to Phandalin and search the ruins for bodies. This was Splugoth, unconvinced by Hoobur Gran'Shoop that the orrery component known to be held by the Golden Mongoose company is gone from the area; see the note in area 12 of the Tresendar Manor dungeons. Splugoth wanted creatures with keen scent to make another attempt at locating any franchise dead.

***Treasure.*** Hamebi's satchel holds 50 gp and a *potion of climbing*.

#### Searching the Grounds
With the jackalwere and her pack defeated or driven off, the characters can search the grounds. If they search in the area where the jackals were digging, see "Survivor" below. If they explore the remains of the buildings on the grounds, a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the following:

- Newly built wooden structures were struck by fire. Two of those still stand, but most have been burned or smashed to the ground.
- The older masonry of the manor walls had been crumbling for some time. New stonework was replacing the old, but everything has been smashed to pieces.
- Older humanoid remains were the source of the jackals' meal. However, no intact corpses can be found among the rubble.

Additionally, the walls of the still-standing structures bear a mark in chalk—a double-"D" insignia. This is the sigil of Dran Enterprises. As adventurers familiar with the operations of Acquisitions Incorporated, all the characters recognize the mark of Acq Inc's greatest rival organization. (The marks have been scribed by the archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop, who is charged by the Six with ensuring that Dran Enterprises takes the blame for the attack on the Acq Inc franchise at Phandalin. More on Hoobur will be revealed in *episode 3*.)

***Treasure.*** The two intact wooden buildings hold seven tendays' worth of rations, two explorer's packs, and a dungeoneer's pack, along with other adventuring equipment that has been smashed, burned, or melted.

![[057-04-17.png|right|300]]

#### Survivor
As the characters search the area where the jackals were digging, a low, pained moaning rises from beneath the rubble. Carefully pulling away the rocks reveals a half-orc buried under smashed and still-smoldering masonry. This is **Gildha Duhn**, majordomo of the Company of the Golden Mongoose franchise. She is starving, dehydrated, and addled. **Gildha** uses the **acolyte** stat block with these racial traits:

- When reduced to 0 hit points, she drops to 1 hit point instead (but can't do this again until she finishes a long rest).
- She has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- She speaks Common and Orc.

Gildha repeatedly mutters something in a low voice, but she has something in her mouth that makes it impossible to understand her. Oddly, that something is a complex clockwork device, which Gildha stuck in her mouth to keep out of enemy hands during the attack. If the device is removed, the characters hear her repeatedly say, "They came for it... they came for the timepiece..."

If given magical healing or allowed to sleep for an hour after being given food and water, Gildha regains her senses. She tells the characters that she worked for the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise in Phandalin, and that while working on their ongoing renovation of Tresendar Manor, the franchisees were attacked at night by unknown assailants. Gildha knows few details of the attack and heard little of the aftermath. Though she saw one of her group escape by teleporting away, she isn't sure what happened to the others. Falling rubble knocked her down, then buried her. Surviving on nothing but rainwater and her half-orc endurance, Gildha has been in and out of consciousness since the attack.

#### The Timepiece of Travel
When the characters examine the somewhat sodden device that was in Gildha's mouth, they can see that its design and etched glyphs clearly mark it as part of the *Orrery of the Wanderer*.

**Gildha** knows a little about the device, which she calls the *timepiece of travel*. The Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose found the relic six months ago in the possession of an evil adventuring band, who claimed to have taken it not long before from a tomb haunted by undead. After careful scrutineering and research, the Golden Mongoose adventurers learned that the timepiece had magical powers dedicated to navigation and teleportation, and speculated that it was just one piece of a larger and more potent magic device.

During the attack, Gildha saw one of the Golden Mongoose adventurers—a female tiefling paladin occultant named Talanatha Three-Coins—activate the *timepiece of travel* and teleport away. For reasons unknown, the timepiece stayed behind (see the "Level Inappropriate" sidebar). Gildha grabbed the relic, but has no idea where Talanatha went.

Gildha also tells the characters that she saw some of the attackers heading into a small cellar beneath the manor, consisting of storage areas and a spring-fed cistern. She knows that the manor features subterranean areas more extensive than the cellar, but the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had yet to do a thorough search of those areas. (As a result, Gildha doesn't know about the secret door that leads to the dungeon.)

"The Orrery of the Wanderer" makes use of an adventure trope as old as D&D itself—working up a totally high-powered artifact, then dropping it into the hands of low-level characters just to see what happens. The orrery and its six components are presented in *appendix D*, and the powers of these relics are significant. But the fact that the orrery is an artifact in a some-assembly-required state gives you a lot of latitude in determining how you dole those powers out.

The orrery's components are set up so that their magic gets weird while the orrery is in pieces. At your determination, that magic might act in unpredictable ways, not recharge as often as normal, or add random effects to keep the characters on their toes. One aspect of this unpredictability comes into play in the adventure when the tiefling Talanatha uses the *timepiece of travel* to escape from the attack on Tresendar Manor, only to have the timepiece stay behind (see later on in this episode for details).

By making sure the characters understand the unpredictable nature of the components' magic, you give them good incentive to be cautious about using them. And if the power of the components threatens to derail parts of the adventure (for example, if the characters plan on using the *timepiece of travel* to teleport everywhere and find every secret location in the scenario), feel free to have the power of individual components mysteriously fail until they are all installed in the orrery housing once more.

## Tresendar Manor Dungeon
Although the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose didn't find the secret door leading into the hidden basement beneath the manor, the agents of the Six did. They then made extensive use of the dungeon before departing. Map 2.2 shows the layout of the dungeons beneath the manor.

![[059-map-2-2-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### General Features
Except where otherwise noted, all areas of the dungeon have the following features.

***Ceilings.*** The ceilings are 10 feet high.

***Light.*** The dungeon is dark. Old but still functional torches and lanterns are affixed to the walls of some rooms at your determination, but they need to be lit to be useful.

***Doors.*** Most doors in the dungeon are wooden, and are closed and unlocked. If a door is locked, it takes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to open it. A locked door can also be smashed open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

A character looking for a secret door finds one with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### 1. Cellar
The stairway leading down into the cellar shows signs of recent foot traffic. Characters can find these tracks easily. When the characters open the door at the bottom of the stairs, read:

>>The door at the bottom of the stairs opens atop a set of double stairs that descend, north and south, about ten feet into a cellar. At the west end of that room, a cistern full of clear water bubbles lazily. A door on the cellar's west wall is ajar.
>>

***Cistern.*** Operatives of the Six tainted the cistern here. The water might appear pure, but it's teeming with a magical disease called ghoul gut. No antacid in this world or any other can beat it.

***Ghoul Gut.*** Water polluted with ghoul parts carries ghoul gut. A creature drinking this tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the disease. Symptoms strike when a victim starts a long rest or next becomes excited, as during combat. A victim suffers severe cramps, and their bowels make sounds like two ghouls fighting. When the symptoms first strike, the victim takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage. In addition, a diseased victim regains no hit points or Hit Dice from nonmagical sources, including resting or spending Hit Dice. A victim who finishes a long rest can attempt a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the victim shakes off the disease. Failure deals the character another 5 (2d4) necrotic damage.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check can also remove the disease from another creature. Doing so requires the character making the check to care for the sick individual during a long rest. The caregiver gains no benefit from that rest.

***Secret Door.*** A secret door leading to area 8 is hidden in the wall in the southwest corner of the room. Agents of the Six have used this door recently. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival or Perception) check can spot the door or note scuff marks and tracks leading through it.

***Walled Door.*** The door that leads to area 3 was walled over when the Redbrand Ruffians were ousted from the dungeons. The masonry over the doorway is obviously newer than the existing stonework, and is poorly mortared. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check confirms that something is behind the new wall. It takes 5 minutes to remove this masonry, or 1 minute if a heavy bludgeoning tool or weapon is used.

#### 2. Storage

>>Stacks of crates and casks line the walls of this storeroom.
>>

***Trap.*** Agents of the Six braced three *flasks of alchemist's fire* loosely behind the crates. Any character who searches the crates must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the rigged flasks before moving the crates or otherwise disturbing them. If a character moves any crates before spotting the trap, the three flasks tumble in different directions, exploding in a way that covers the entire room. Each creature in the room takes 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

***Treasure.*** If the characters spot the trap, any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check can safely retrieve the three *alchemist's fire flasks*, disarming the trap. The crates and casks contain building supplies (nails, mortar, glue, and so forth) worth a total of 100 gp.

#### 3. Hall with Pit

>>Defaced murals and metal etchings, probably once quite beautiful, adorn this hallway. An open pit divides the passage's eastern and western ends. Hanging from nooses above the pit are two humanoid figures, each clothed in white with a purple hood pulled over its head.
>>

***Creatures.*** The creatures hanging here are two **scarecrows** created by the archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop. The constructs remain motionless until the adventurers move close or attack. These scarecrows can cut the rope holding them with their claws, but they prefer to remain hanging from their ropes while they swing to pull foes into the pit, using the following attack:

***Swinging Grab.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: The scarecrow pulls the target 10 feet.

If a creature is pulled into the area of the pit, it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target falls into the pit. On a success, the target lands prone at the pit's edge.

***Pit.*** The pit is 20 feet deep. Operatives of the Six spread shards of broken glass over the bottom of the pit, so that a creature falling in takes 2 (1d4) slashing damage in addition to 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall. Climbing the rough walls requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

***Development.*** If the characters defeat the scarecrows and search the constructs, large stones can be found in each one's stuffing. Hoobur Gran'Shoop's sigil—the dragon skull pierced by a sword from the bottom up—is carved into these stones.

#### 4. Crypt

>>Three smashed human-sized coffins and one intact smaller coffin lie on the floor here. The larger coffins are carved of fine mahogany and lined with rotting silk. Humanoid bones are scattered across the floor.
>>

***Creature.*** The smaller coffin is a **mimic** left to guard this area by agents of the Six. In its current form, this monster is indistinguishable from an object, so it surprises any group that has no means to detect it before it attacks.

***Bones.*** When the mimic attacks, the bones spread across the floor begin to rattle and move, as if attempting to form into undead skeletons. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check sees that fine wire ties the bones to the mimic, so that when the mimic moves, the bones move too.

***Treasure.*** One of the larger coffins has a pouch sewn into the lining under an embroidered star, which a character can find with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The pouch detaches from the lining with any sharp tug. Inside is a *potion of gaseous form* and a *potion of frost giant strength*, kept as a means of escape for someone accidentally entombed alive.

#### 5. Cells
The door to this area is locked. If the characters listen at it, they can hear ragged breathing. When they open the door, read:

>>This room reeks of filth and death. The corpse of a dragonborn rots in a rusty cell of iron bars to the north. To the south, a similar cell holds two living prisoners.
>>

The cell doors are both locked.

***Creature.*** Courtesy of the magic of Hoobur Gran'Shoop, the rotting dragonborn reanimates as a **ghast** moments after anyone opens the north cell. A character who quickly examines the corpse and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices tremors coursing through the body that warn of its imminent rise. Even before it animates, the corpse registers as undead to spells and other abilities that detect such creatures.

***Prisoners.*** The two prisoners in the south cell are the sisters Ebella and Ocheri Splintfig (N female half-elf **commoners**). When the characters enter, the Splintfigs are too weak to move, but they beg for help. Both must be given food and water before they can freely speak. If either sister takes any damage, she dies. Moreover, if the characters fail to give the sisters food and water within 10 minutes, one of them dies. The surviving sibling then makes it her life's mission to seek revenge on everyone involved, including the adventurers who failed to act quickly enough to save her sister.

The Splintfig sisters sell rare herbs and spell components, and were visiting the manor to see if the franchisees wanted any of their wares. Their choice to stay the night turned out to be a textbook case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time when the Six's operatives attacked. The Splintfigs hid during the assault, but Drahkso Blaakberz, a dragonborn mercenary and part of the assault force, found them. Drahkso took pity on the sisters and refused to kill them, so his comrades locked him up with them.

The sisters talked to Drahkso a bit, and learned he was a mercenary hired to attack the manor. He mentioned that his employer was a short, hooded person who sounded like a goblin. Eventually, some thugs came and took Drahkso away. They then returned with his corpse and tossed it back in the cell.

***Treasure.*** Four rare platinum coins (worth 15 gp each) covered in dirt and grime can be found in the north cell, as can three glass vials hidden by Drahkso—two *potions of healing* and one *potion of animal friendship*. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds the treasure.

If the characters rescue both Splintfig sisters, the grateful half-elves return to Phandalin at a later date to give the party rare herbs worth 100 gp.

***Franchise Opportunity.*** If rescued and treated well, the Splintfig sisters might become franchise business partners. As procurers of rare spell components, Ebella and Ocheri can expand their operation with suitable capital and assistance in locating and harvesting monster parts and other rare materials.

#### 6. Empty Room

>>This small room is breathtakingly empty.
>>

Sometimes, rooms are empty. Let the players' paranoia play out, though, as the characters search and ponder and fret.

#### 7. Failed Ritual

>>A dozen desiccated and skeletal humanoid corpses litter the floor of this small chamber. The stone of the north wall has been etched with intricate runes, but the pattern ends abruptly.
>>

***Bodies and Runes.*** A closer examination of the still-intact bodies reveals that each bears tattoos matching the runes carved on the walls. The corpses wear a wide range of clothing and armor, but have been stripped of all valuables and gear. Some are the fallen members and staff of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. Others are innocent bystanders the operatives of the Six came across as they moved toward the manor from the north. Still others are Six agents who died during the attack.

A character who has proficiency in Arcana can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check when examining the corpses and sigils. With a success, the character discerns that the runes are connected to a ritual that could open a rift to the Far Realm. The dead humanoids were likely victims sacrificed to power the ritual. Something went wrong, though, and the victims were consumed before the ritual could be completed. A success with this check, or 5 minutes spent studying the runes and the bodies, gives characters advantage on their checks to work against the active rift in area 10.

***Secret Doors.*** Both the secret doors in this room swivel open like the door in the cellar.

#### 8. Charnel Chasm

>>The smell of death is strong in what was probably once a large and ornate hall, long since fallen into ruin. Not only are the walls and supports crumbling, but a ten-foot-deep rift has opened up in the floor. Two wooden bridges span the rift, whose floor is littered with skeletal corpses.
>>

The rift floor is difficult terrain because of the bodies. Any character who approaches the edge of the rift and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear a faint crunching sound emanating from the bodies.

***Creatures.*** The crunching is a clue that the rift contains two **swarms of insects** feasting on the dead bodies. When any character moves near the rift or a bridge, the swarms emerge to attack.

***Development.*** The bodies here wear a wide range of clothing and armor, and are of the same origin as the bodies in area 7. All were dumped here after being sacrificed to fuel the ritual in area 10.

***Tunnel.*** A tunnel leads out of the rift to the south. The operatives working for the Six collapsed it intentionally, as can be determined with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check. A character who has an engineering or mining background has advantage on this check. With three days of digging and careful reinforcement, the tunnel can be cleared again. Where it runs 100 feet to the south, the tunnel opens up to a small cave hidden in the forest outside Phandalin.

#### 9. Between a Rock and a Cockatrice
When the characters attempt to open the door into this area, they find it locked from the inside. If they pick or smash the lock and then try to open the door, read:

>>The door strikes a large piece of stone on the floor, making it difficult to push open.
>>

***Opening the Door.*** The stone blocking the door is a small statue—a kobold petrified by a pair of **undead cockatrices** that dwell here. The door can be forced open with a successful DC 10 Strength check. However, if the check succeeds by 5 or more, the door breaks, causing the character attempting the check to spill into the room and fall prone.

When the characters enter, continue with the following:

>>Apart from a fallen kobold statue that blocked the door, this room contains only four beds. Each is covered in torn sheets, its straw mattress crawling with bugs.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **undead cockatrices** lurk beneath the south beds. Each uses the **cockatrice** stat block with these changes:

- The creature is undead.
- It has immunity to the poisoned condition and to poison damage.

After the fight, a thorough examination of the **undead cockatrices** reveals a tiny sigil etched into each of their beaks—the draconic skull with an upthrust sword that is the symbol of Hoobur Gran'Shoop.

***Development.*** Any character who succeeds on a DC 11 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check knows that any creature petrified by the cockatrices, including the kobold, should return to normal in 24 hours. Sure enough, half a day later, the kobold—named Patsky—revives. Patsky is hungry, thirsty, scared, and used to being bullied. No matter how the characters treat him, he tells them that he was a servant to the attackers who assaulted the manor. Those attackers brought the living (at the time) cockatrices with them, but chose to leave them behind when they moved on. A spellcaster put a mark on them (the dragon-skull symbol), then ordered Patsky to lock the creatures in this room. They pecked him before he could escape, and have been repeating the process every time the kobold recovers. At some point, the cockatrices died and reanimated, but the kobold doesn't know how.

Patsky can also tell the characters the general story of the attack. He didn't fight much, since most of the other attackers were stronger, nor does he know who hired the attackers. Hoping to learn some magic, Patsky stuck close to the spellcaster, whose name he knows as Hoobur Gran'Shoop.

***Treasure.*** In gratitude for his rescue, Patsky offers up his only valuables—a gold necklace worth 25 gp, a *potion of resistance (acid)*, and the key to this room.

***Patsky's Future.*** Patsky is another wild-card NPC that you can use in your campaign as desired. If the characters take a liking to him, they might hire him to work for their franchise. If not, assuming anyone in the group was kind to him, Patsky might show up to help the characters with useful information at a later date. Ignored or abused, then left to his own devices, the kobold joins up with some other evil gang led by a spellcaster.

#### 10. Far Realm Rift
When the characters enter this area, read:

>>A five-foot-diameter circle of dark energy crackles in the northwest corner of this room. The walls are etched with complex runes, as well as drawings in charcoal and some reddish substance. These runes pulse with the same dark energy of the portal, surging and ebbing in a steady rhythm.
>>

The portal crackling in the corner is a growing gate to the Far Realm, activated by operatives of the Six before they vacated this area. Characters entering the room provide the spark of energy the portal needs to bring across its first creature.

***Creature.*** After the first character enters the room, roll initiative. A **gibbering mouther** wriggles through the portal on its initiative count, but can take no other actions on its first turn. Thereafter, the aberration tears into any other creatures in the room. Any character fighting in close notices the gibbering mouther's eyes blinking in rhythm with the runes and the portal.

***Runes.*** The runes covering the walls keep the portal active. During combat, the characters notice these sigils continuing to pulse in sync with the portal and the gibbering mouther's blinking.

As an action, a character can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to deactivate the runes or a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to sabotage them. Any number of characters can attempt these checks, which can be made each round. All characters have advantage on these checks if someone succeeded on the check in area 7 or the characters examined the failed ritual there.

In each round that one or more characters succeed on the check, the **gibbering mouther** and the portal weaken, as follows:

- **First Success**: The **gibbering mouther** deals half as much damage with its attacks.
- **Second Success**: The **gibbering mouther** loses its Gibbering feature.
- **Third Success**: The portal closes and the **gibbering mouther** dies.

***Development.*** If the portal isn't closed after 1 minute, a second **gibbering mouther** comes through. It suffers any consequences already in place for alterations to the runes.

#### 11. Workshop

>>A long table has been pushed into the northwest corner of this room, with three corpses of male humans piled beneath it. Each corpse is naked to the waist and wearing colorful tights. Visible on the chest of one corpse is a sigil of a draconic skull pierced from the bottom by a sword.
>>

***Creatures.*** Hoobur Gran'Shoop's necromantic rituals have caused the humanoids slain here to come back as three **shadows**. All were professional grapplers hired by the operatives of the Six for the attack on Tresendar Manor, and were executed when the attack was done to provide permanent undead sentries. The shadows currently linger in area 12, but they move under the door into this area to attack if the characters make any noise or bring any light into the room. If the shadows attack, they surprise any character who does not notice their approach with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Tactics.*** The shadows remember being professional grapplers, and they put on a show as they attack, tossing each other toward their enemies, "jumping" off the table or each other onto foes, and so forth. They flex and posture, pose and prance in a way that is very unbecoming of a typical undead. If they need a break from the battle, they retreat under the locked door into area 12.

***Development.*** If the characters have Patsky or the Splintfig sisters to ask, they can report that the bodies under the table were grapplers who helped attack the manor. The last time any of the others saw the three, they were alive and among the victors.

#### 12. Office
The door between areas 11 and 12 is locked. When the characters enter area 12, read:

>>A bed and a desk are the only furnishings in this surprisingly clean room. The bed is made with linen sheets and a fluffy pillow. Atop the desk are an ink pot and a quill pen.
>>

Hoobur Gran'Shoop cleaned and set up this area as a command headquarters for the few days his forces remained in the dungeon.

***Secret Messages.*** Crumpled up under the desk is a piece of paper covered with ink blots—residue from when the paper was placed under another piece of paper that was written upon. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check discerns the impressions on the paper, which can be read by rubbing charcoal across the page or with careful study.

>>*S—*
>>
>>*We have completed our work here. Omin's moppets have been defeated, although the half-orc and the tiefling escaped. We believe the former ran for the woods, which means she will be ours soon enough. The latter, we cannot locate. We could not find the timepiece either, and it is possible the tiefling took it with her. However, if its magic functions as erratically as does that of the far gear, there may be more searching to be done*.
>>
>>*Everything goes according to plan, and the manor should be free to claim. Loose ends are being tied up as I write this*.
>>
>>*I am, always, your obliging servant*,
>>
>>*Hoobur*
>>

Beneath the signature is the symbol of a draconic skull pierced by a sword from the bottom up.

## Clean-Up Crew
Dran Enterprises keeps a close watch on Acquisitions Incorporated operations. Whenever an Acq Inc franchise fails, Dran Enterprises swoops in to make a hostile takeover of the assets and expand its own operations. The Phandalin franchise is no exception. As soon as Sister Garaele saw the trouble at Tresendar Manor, the priest of Tymora let Dran Enterprises know. Dran Enterprises then dispatched a crew of hobgoblins to evaluate the area, clean up, and take control of Tresendar Manor as quickly as possible. When the adventurers leave the dungeon for the final time, they see that cleanup crew in any area close to the entrance.

>>As you step through the door, two hobgoblins pause, staring at you with a mix of anger and confusion. One wears an oversized tank on her back with a hand-held hose and nozzle emerging from it. A clear, viscous liquid drips from the nozzle, sizzling and smoking when it hits the ground. The second hobgoblin brandishes a lethal-looking sword. Both wear leather armor branded with the insignia of Dran Enterprises.
>>

***Creatures.*** These two **hobgoblins**—**Grunka** and Fraht—lead the Dran Enterprises advance crew. They arrived clandestinely just after the characters entered the dungeon, and aren't expecting any resistance given the low-key nature of their cleaning assignment. **Grunka** wears an acid spray gun, an invention of Dran Enterprises R&D. Add the following attack action to her stat block:

![[060-04-19.png|right|300]]

***Acid Spray Gun (Recharge 5–6).*** The hobgoblin sprays acid in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spray gun has a tank that can be filled with ten standard *vials of acid* mixed with water, allowing it to be used five times.

During the third round, two more **hobgoblins** rush to join the attack from a nearby room. One of those hobgoblins carries and will use two *spell scrolls* (see "Treasure" below).

All the hobgoblins are pragmatic professionals. If it looks like the fight is going against them, or if two hobgoblins quickly fall, the survivors ask for quarter.

***Treasure.*** Each hobgoblin has 25 gp and a *potion of healing*. Additionally, one carries a *potion of resistance (necrotic)* and the other carries a *spell scroll* of *cause fear* and a *spell scroll* of *blindness/deafness* (if those weren't used in the fight).

The characters can also take the acid spray gun, and they find a sack holding ten *vials of acid* near the hobgoblins.

***Development.*** Any NPCs the characters rescued from the dungeon or left in the ruins hide during the combat. Those characters emerge from hiding only when the situation is safe.

If questioned, any surviving hobgoblins proudly admit that they work for Dran Enterprises, and that they were hired to clean up the manor site and prepare it for annexation. The hobgoblins claim (truthfully) to know nothing about what happened to reduce the manor to ruins, or the fate of the missing tiefling from the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. They have no connection to the Dran Enterprises insignia scribed among the manor ruins. They can't say for certain that Dran Enterprises didn't have some involvement with the incident, but if so, it had nothing to do with them.

## Conclusion
With their adventures in Phandalin complete, the characters attain 3rd level! More importantly, after clearing the ruins and dungeon of Tresendar Manor, they are able to officially launch their own Acquisitions Incorporated franchise! The characters need to send a message to **Omin Dran** to report their findings. Not long after, Omin contacts them using magic, congratulating them on their success, telling them to rest up, and informing them that a representative of Acquisitions Incorporated will arrive soon to deliver paperwork and any other information a new franchise needs.

Sure enough, well-known Acquisitions Incorporated operative Viari (see *appendix A*) arrives the next day to deliver the documents and supplies, and to officially christen the new Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. He has each of the characters sign a contract crammed full of legalese and double-talk. Any character who reads the document and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check can decipher the jargon to learn the following, or Viari can explain the highlights:

- Franchisees pay a monthly fee to Acquisitions Incorporated to maintain their franchise.
- As part of that fee, Acquisitions Incorporated handles parts of the franchise's operations, including location procurement, staff management, and other benefits.
- The monthly fee paid to Acquisitions Incorporated by a starter franchise covers the salaries of a majordomo, a skilled hireling, and two untrained hirelings. Franchisees must pay any hirelings employed beyond this number.
- The franchise is licensed to operate in Phandalin and within 5 miles of the town, and is protected against interference in that area from other franchises.
- Acquisitions Incorporated will deal with acquiring the rights to Tresendar Manor from Harbin Wester, as they did for the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose.

"*Franchise Advancement*" in chapter 2 has detailed explanations of all these benefits and more.

One of the franchise's first hires might be right in front of them already. **Gildha Duhn**, former majordomo for the Company of the Golden Mongoose, is grieving her lost employers and anxious to put her life back together. With previous experience running a franchise (and no fault in that franchise's destruction), she makes an excellent choice for majordomo, and suggests that role for herself if the characters don't ask her. The remaining episodes in this adventure assume that the characters selected **Gildha Duhn** as their franchise's majordomo. If they chose another NPC to fill that role, simply adjust the text throughout the adventure accordingly.

With the contract signed, the ruins of Tresendar Manor become the franchise's starter headquarters! One of the benefits of Head Office negotiating with Harbin Wester for the lease to the manor is that the company can drive a much harder bargain than the characters would ever be able to strike. This beneficial deal might have hidden downsides, though, as the thin profit margins of the lease become a point of ongoing conflict between the characters and the corrupt banker.

#### Company Positions
At the signing of the franchise agreement, each character picks one of the positions detailed in "*Company Positions*" in chapter 2. When they do so, Viari hands out any special position gear and instructs the characters in how best to fulfill their roles. Chapter 2 has more details on these positions, the benefits they confer, and what they mean to the franchise. Hopefully, the players have already considered what positions are the best fit for their characters and for the franchise as a whole, but if not, give them time. Make sure it's clear what each position entails and what franchise duties a character with a given position is expected to perform.

In addition to the characters' positions, the franchise majordomo can also select a company position if desired. This is especially useful if there's a key position that none of the players wants to take, or if the party size is small.

## Franchise Downtime
The process of rebuilding Tresendar Manor will take some time, and as proud franchise owners, the characters need to be around to pitch in and make sure nothing goes awry. At the same time, their newly awarded territory is ripe for exploration and interaction with potential customers and business partners. As the characters take stock of their situation, they can engage in downtime activities and undertake some of the franchise tasks that operate alongside the downtime rules.

All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the "*Franchise Tasks and Downtime*" section in chapter 2. That section notes which books existing activities can be found in.

#### New Business
As the characters spend time establishing their new commercial home turf, the explore territory downtime activity can yield up all kinds of new opportunities and connections. Interesting NPCs might be revealed on a walkabout in the woods around Phandalin, or the characters might locate stands of prime timber or abandoned mines still holding valuable ore. Such resources can become part of the franchise's ongoing revenue stream.

Commercial connections forged with NPCs could also be formalized and refined. The lizardfolk of the Mere of Dead Men and the Splintfig sisters are just two of the potential business partnerships from this episode, whether the characters engage those NPCs themselves or allocate members of their brand-new staff for those tasks.

#### Thinking Locally
In Phandalin, the characters might use the marketeering activity to set up a partnership with Linene Graywind at the Lionshield Coster, or with Sharna Quirstiron of the Phandalin Miner's Exchange—whether they know Sharna's true allegiances or not. Depending on how well the characters are getting along with Harbin Wester, the shady business practice activity might let them get more dirt on the banker, or gain his favor by going after some of his rivals.

Shady business practices might be an even bigger part of the characters' plans for their franchise. Any number of dodgy NPCs in town might be interested in partnering with characters who want to skirt the law. Smuggling ore without paying taxes, skimming from the coffers of either temple, running illegal gambling at the Sleeping Giant—any of these activities could net a nice profit with relatively limited risk.

#### Staying on the Good Side
If the characters have nobler aspirations for their franchise—or if they're savvy enough to want to hide their franchise's ignoble aspirations from the get-go—a philanthropic enterprise can go a long way toward shoring up the party's reputation. A franchise could work to support the existing charity efforts of either of the local temples, or the characters could create their own fund for out-of-work miners. Doing so makes acquiring ongoing concessions or information from townsfolk much easier, but puts the characters in the bad graces of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner's Exchange.

#### Leads to the Lighthouse
Even as the characters are setting up their new franchise, you'll want to work in hooks to lead them to the next stage in the adventure. Based on what they've learned during this episode, the characters are aware that the only other survivor of the attack on the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the tiefling paladin occultant Talanatha Three-Coins. Clearly the best source of information regarding the attack on the manor, Talanatha used the *timepiece of travel* to teleport away, but no one knows where she went.

Many of the locals had interactions with Talanatha in the three months that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was around Phandalin, and characters can use the schmoozing or carousing downtime activities to learn more about the tiefling. In particular, a number of the regulars at the Sleeping Giant remember drinking with Talanatha. She often grumbled about whether the Company of the Golden Mongoose was the best fit for her, and talked about a good friend named Wizzy who worked for another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. The details on Wizzy's franchise are vague, but Talanatha spoke of her friend having "an awesome headquarters up the coast."

Characters can also spend downtime investigating the *Orrery of the Wanderer* and the *timepiece of travel*, using either the scrutineering or research activities. In addition to revealing more details of the orrery as you see fit (see *appendix D*), such investigation could reveal that the last place the timepiece teleported someone to was a location on the Sea of Swords, north of Neverwinter but south of Luskan. Scrutineering or inquiries through Head Office turns up information on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise based in that area—the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, which has its headquarters in an old lighthouse along a stretch of coast known locally as Silent Sound.

Whatever clues the characters obtain regarding Talanatha's likely destination, have those hints play out over the full length of the downtime rather than rushing to advance to the next episode. The players should get used to how big a part downtime and franchise activities play in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.

## Continuing the Adventure
Before the next phase of the adventure, make sure the characters have their franchise and business affairs in order. They should know who their franchise employees are, giving those staff members detailed instructions about what to do while the characters are away. This sort of planning is a common theme in any Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so establish this precedent early.

Speculating that Talanatha Three-Coins might have fled to the Silent Sound lighthouse headquarters of another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, the characters might attempt to make contact with that franchise, either on their own or through Head Office. However, any such attempts yield no response. At some point, Omin Dran contacts the characters if they don't contact him first. He's worried about what the lack of contact with the Order of the Stout Half-Pint might mean, and he wants the characters to investigate.

The presence of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin is troubling for Omin—especially if the Dran Enterprises hobgoblins were killed without the characters questioning them, leading to the assumption that the organization was behind the initial attack. If the characters aren't suitably intrigued by the orrery and its newly discovered component, that can be another thing that Omin charges them with investigating. Armed with a solid guess that Talanatha fled to the lighthouse, the characters prepare to head north!
---
# Episode 3: Darkness at the Lighthouse
![[061-04-20.png|right|300]]

In this episode, the characters (newly enfranchised and now 3rd level) travel to the Silent Sound lighthouse to search for Talanatha, the tiefling paladin occultant of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. On the way, Omin Dran contacts them with a request. He wants them to stop in Neverwinter to check on a cache of Acquisitions Incorporated treasure being stored there. However, the doppelganger who hid the cache has been arrested and is about to be executed. Even if the characters save her, retrieving the treasure where it's been hidden in the House of Knowledge—Oghma's temple in Neverwinter—will take more time and effort than Omin predicted.

Leaving Neverwinter, the characters head north in the direction of Silent Sound. But even as the lighthouse comes into view, they spot a small boat under attack by creatures from the deep. If they rescue the crew, the characters might find a business opportunity that involves partaking in a little mutiny against a ruthless captain.

At the lighthouse, the characters confirm that the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise headquartered there—the Order of the Stout Half-Pint—was attacked, and that most of its members have been killed. Moving up through the different levels of the lighthouse tower, the franchisees find more and more evidence that the same spellcaster whose creations they've previously faced has wrought havoc there. That spellcaster, Hoobur Gran'Shoop, is found working in a grisly laboratory beneath the tower, to which the adventurers gain entrance through the lighthouse's magic lens. That laboratory is only part of the lighthouse's secret basement, though, and the characters engage in some dangerous and lucrative dungeoneering after dealing with—or doing a deal with—Hoobur.

With the threats in the lighthouse dispensed with, the characters learn that its franchise members had also recently collected one of the clockwork components of the *Orrery of the Wanderer*. They also have evidence in hand pointing to the involvement of Dran Enterprises in the attack on the lighthouse, building on the sighting of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin. But what does Dran Enterprises want with the orrery? And which band of plucky franchisees will be tasked with finding out?

## To the Lighthouse
With the franchise headquarters in Phandalin secured and the rebuilding of Tresendar Manor underway, the adventurers have a clear path ahead of them to the Silent Sound lighthouse. However, you get to decide how complicated the journey turns out to be.

One big question is whether the characters should travel overland up the Sword Coast, or whether you want to let them teleport directly to Silent Sound using the *timepiece of travel*. Either option is fine. With an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign often involving access to crazy magic, don't be afraid to let the characters make use of it. But there are options for holding back on the magic of the orrery and its components if you want to (see the "Level Inappropriate" sidebar in episode 2), and an overland journey has its own rewards, in the form of additional encounters and side treks that can help build a fun story.

This episode provides one side trek that sees the characters stop in Neverwinter on their way to the lighthouse, which can be made use of no matter what the party's method of travel. Additionally, if the characters are traveling overland, you can introduce random encounters along the road using the same method and table from episode 2. If you roll a result that makes no sense, roll again or create an encounter of your own.

"The Orrery of the Wanderer" makes use of an adventure trope as old as D&D itself—working up a totally high-powered artifact, then dropping it into the hands of low-level characters just to see what happens. The orrery and its six components are presented in *appendix D*, and the powers of these relics are significant. But the fact that the orrery is an artifact in a some-assembly-required state gives you a lot of latitude in determining how you dole those powers out.

The orrery's components are set up so that their magic gets weird while the orrery is in pieces. At your determination, that magic might act in unpredictable ways, not recharge as often as normal, or add random effects to keep the characters on their toes. One aspect of this unpredictability comes into play in the adventure when the tiefling Talanatha uses the *timepiece of travel* to escape from the attack on Tresendar Manor, only to have the timepiece stay behind (see later on in this episode for details).

By making sure the characters understand the unpredictable nature of the components' magic, you give them good incentive to be cautious about using them. And if the power of the components threatens to derail parts of the adventure (for example, if the characters plan on using the *timepiece of travel* to teleport everywhere and find every secret location in the scenario), feel free to have the power of individual components mysteriously fail until they are all installed in the orrery housing once more.

## A Detour to Neverwinter
Before the characters leave for the lighthouse, or while they are on the High Road traveling toward Neverwinter, Omin Dran makes contact with a "small favor." Neverwinter is located on the High Road on the way to the Silent Sound lighthouse, so is an easy stop for the party to make.

Head Office assignments of this sort can become common in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, especially as the characters' reputation as troubleshooters grows. You can use such side treks as useful support for a franchise's main mission, or as an inconvenient interruption.

#### A Simple Request
**Omin Dran** contacts the characters via the franchise documancer's *documancy satchel* or some other form of magic. When he does, read the following to detail his request:

>>"Yeah, so I'm going to need you to do a little extra work for me. It shouldn't be too taxing. I have a contact in Neverwinter who's secured a cache of treasure. Her name is Oppal DeScart, and you can usually find her in a tavern in the Blacklake District known as the Stable Quiver. She's a shapeshifter, so I can't say for sure what she'll look like when you locate her. You can suss her out with the passphrase "That's a big hen house," and she should reply with "Only to a small fox." When you locate her, tell her that it's safe to "Move the cargo along the Platinum Road." And that's it. She'll give you the treasure to get out of Neverwinter safely. The whole affair should take a few hours, and then you can be on your way. You can get the goods to me when you return."
>>

Omin's primary concern is to have Oppal's treasure secured and removed from the city without drawing the attention of Neverwinter's tax collectors. He tells the characters that the treasure is small but its container is warded, and that they should be prepared to store and carry it without looking in it. Omin isn't keen to get into additional details, though, suggesting that the less the characters know, the better. (This is another potentially entertaining hallmark of assignments handed down from Head Office, and plausible deniability is one of the core competencies of any successful Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.)

#### The Backstory
Either on their way to Neverwinter or while in the city, the characters might want to dig around a bit to find out more about what exactly they're getting into. They might also assign a franchise task to their staff back in Phandalin, getting them to use scrutineering or research to find out more.

If you want to make Neverwinter a bigger part of your campaign, more information about the city can be found in the *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*. But the following information covers the basics the characters can learn regarding this side trek:

- Everything that goes on in Neverwinter is inexorably tied to Lord Dagult Neverember. After being ousted from his position as Open Lord of Waterdeep, Neverember took up the mantle of Lord Protector of Neverwinter.
- The citizens of Neverwinter accepted the rule of an autocrat who brought peace and stability to a fractious city. With the foundation of his rule solidly established, Lord Neverember cracked down on the nobility and the guilds, whom the lower classes were more than happy to blame for any problems in the city.
- Neverember has levied heavy taxes against wealthy merchants and the aristocracy. Acquisitions Incorporated maintains significant financial holdings in Neverwinter. Given the current political climate in the city, those holdings are going to be overtaxed if they are discovered.

On Omin's orders, Oppal DeScart, a **doppelganger** in the employ of Acquisitions Incorporated, has been working to move Acq Inc treasure out of Neverwinter. By consolidating caches of treasure and using them to purchase rare diamonds, she's been able to convert a great deal of wealth into portable form, ready for secure retrieval. Unfortunately for her—and unknown to Omin Dran—Oppal was recently arrested for murder in a case of mistaken identity. She's currently being held in the dungeons beneath the ruins of Castle Never, awaiting execution.

*As my documancer, Walnut, is so fond of saying: Ignore Head Office's missives at your own peril. (She says it more like, "This is a task from Omin, so we're going to drop everything and do it TODAY!!!")*— Rosie Beestinger
#### The Stable Quiver
When the characters arrive in Neverwinter, they find themselves in a city divided—quite literally. Part of the metropolis is magnificent, with breathtaking architecture, marvelous spires, and opulent decorations. And amid that beauty is a terrible scar caused by the eruption of Mount Hotenow years before. Citizens are still rebuilding from that disaster, largely thanks to the extra taxes Lord Neverember levies against the wealthy. The city's poorer residents benefit from the rebuilding work, and live in hope that the artisans and builders in the City of Skilled Hands can turn their home into the Jewel of the North once again.

The Stable Quiver is a nondescript, well-built tavern in the Blacklake District, an area that covers the northwest part of the city. The tavern boasts a mixed clientele of lesser nobles, artisans, middle-class merchants, and skilled laborers. It's a perfect meeting place for citizens engaged in activities they wish to keep out of the public eye. The low-life element normally eschews the place, except in cases where they meet with the tavern's regular patrons—who are no less criminal in many cases.

***Locating Oppal.*** When the characters enter the tavern, all the tables are occupied, but several empty stools stand at the bar. The barkeep is Squid (N male half-elf **commoner**), so-called by the locals because of a squid-shaped birthmark on his face.

If the characters ask Squid about Oppal by name, or about any shapechangers working in the area, the half-elf initially denies knowing anything about such a person. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check notices that the barkeep is clearly concealing something. If the characters push the issue, a successful DC 10 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check causes Squid to dish up information. Any Charisma (Intimidation) check inspires him to first direct the characters toward some random character who he swears is Oppal, just to lighten the mood. He also spills if the characters offer him a bribe of 5 gp or more.

>>"Afraid Oppal got herself nicked. Funny bit was, with all the laws she's broke, she gets picked up for somethin' she didn't do. Murder no less! But I'll tell you true, Oppal ain't the murderin' type.
>>
>>"See, Oppal was pretending to be a local orc thug, gettin' some information for a client. But in the meantime, that orc kills somebody on that very same night Oppal's pretendin' to be him. The guards know the orc, then they find Oppal lookin' like him, arrest her, and throw her in the holes under Castle Never. Even though they know she's a changer, they still blame her. Easier work for them. That's the lot of a usual suspect in Neverwinter."
>>

If the characters can't convince Squid to talk to them, they can chat with others in the tavern. With the right motivation, another NPC can point the group in the right direction.

***Interested Bystander.*** One of the patrons at the Stable Quiver when the characters arrive to inquire about Oppal is Moguhl Vloot. This petite human wears a nicely tailored suit and has slicked-back gray hair, even though she appears no older than thirty. Being a wererat keeps one looking young.

Moguhl works for a local thieves' guild and keeps tabs on illicit goods going into and out of the city. Her guild has brokered some of the treasure Oppal has been selling, and Moguhl's bosses want to find out where the doppelganger has been hiding the cash she's been stockpiling. With Oppal set for execution, they know they need to work fast, but are still weighing whether trying to get to her in the dungeons of Castle Never is worth the risk.

Moguhl notices the characters asking about Oppal. She tries to hide her interest, but any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check notes her surreptitiously remaining close and listening in when the group acquires the information they need. Moguhl leaves the tavern before the characters can confront her. She slips down an alley and turns into a giant rat if anyone attempts to follow her.

Moguhl quickly gathers five **bandits** to assist her in "questioning" the characters about their knowledge of or dealings with Oppal. A short while after the characters leave the tavern, this gang challenges them, setting Moguhl up to ask who Oppal is working for and where she hid her treasure.

Naturally, the characters are unable to answer Moguhl's second question. But unless the characters also deny knowing the doppelganger's employer and are particularly convincing about their ignorance, Moguhl and her bandits attack in hopes that a good beating can convince them to tell what they know.

Moguhl uses the **wererat** stat block and wields a *+1 shortsword* she calls *Piercer*, which grants her a +1 bonus to her attack and damage rolls.

Moguhl flees before the adventurers can kill or capture her, using her Shapechanger trait to escape or to slip her bonds if subdued and tied up.

***Development.*** If the characters question the defeated bandits, the criminals admit to working for Moguhl from time to time, but they can provide no other actionable information. If Moguhl is captured and convinced to talk, she can provide intelligence on the prison beneath Castle Never, which she has been gathering in case she needs to break in to talk to Oppal.

Characters who contract lycanthropy from Moguhl might have the opportunity to get the curse removed at the Hall of Knowledge later in this episode at a reduced cost, assuming they can help the head priest there with his troubles. See the "Hall of Knowledge" section below.

***Treasure.*** Moguhl and her bandits carry a total of 23 gp. The wererat also has a *spell scroll* of *distort value* (a new spell from chapter 3).

Moguhl's weapon *Piercer* is a rare magic item that requires attunement. The sword is a *+1 shortsword*, and a character attuned to the sword regains the maximum possible number of hit points from expended Hit Dice. However, the attuned character must eat twice as much food each day (a minimum of 2 pounds) to avoid exhaustion (see "*The Environment*" in chapter 8 of the *Player's Handbook*.)

#### The Holes
If the characters don't get initial information from Moguhl about the prison beneath Castle Never, they can use whatever means they choose to gather information. This might include employing appropriate backgrounds, digging into rumors spread by the criminal class, talking to city guards, and so forth.

The characters can learn the following details about the castle and the prison beneath it with appropriate roleplaying or ability checks. Easy-to-acquire information comes earlier in the list, while the details that are harder to acquire are provided later. Dispense the following points as you see fit:

- Castle Never was the historical seat of the rulers of Neverwinter. The eruption of Mount Hotenow and various attacks in the years since have reduced the structure to rubble.
- Lord Neverember has made rebuilding the castle his top priority. Much of the city's steep tax income goes to the rebuilding efforts.
- Neverwinter's worst offenders—murderers, traitors, and tax cheats—are imprisoned beneath the ruins of Castle Never. Locals call this prison "the holes." Trying to free someone from the holes is a good way to end up in them.
- Anyone in the holes has already been found guilty by Lord Neverember of high crimes, the punishment for which is death. Executions take place once each tenday, at noon. The next execution occurs two days from when the characters discover this fact.
- During executions, guards are numerous, and powerful people show up to see justice dispensed. Rescuing one of the condemned from the gallows would be a nearly impossible feat.
- Only one known entrance leads into the holes from the main level of Castle Never. That level is being rebuilt, so bricklayers, stonemasons, and untrained hirelings are common throughout. A minimum of four **guards** and three **veterans** stand watch at the entrance. Seven more **guards** and three **veterans** do the same within the holes.
- On the day before an execution, friends and family of a prisoner are allowed into the holes to bring the condemned a last meal.
- A secret passage is said to access the holes from a cave on the shore of Blacklake, from which the Blacklake District gets its name. No one the characters can talk to has seen or used this passage, which remains only a rumor.

#### Rescuing Oppal
The first step to rescuing Oppal is to communicate with her in some way. However, if a plan is hatched that allows the characters to message her indirectly through a third party (a bribed guard or worker, for instance), Oppal's response makes it clear that she is willing to pass along "the information" only if she is liberated. She understands that the characters' timely appearance is the only thing that stands between her and certain death.

How the characters navigate this tricky dilemma is entirely up to you. Let the players' resourcefulness and your imagination combine to create a memorable story of legendary triumph or narrow failure, followed by even narrower escapes. Ideas and plans for getting to and rescuing Oppal can cover any of the following options:

- A corrupt member of the Neverwinter city guard might help get the characters into the holes for a price. But that guard might also charge a higher and previously unmentioned price to get them out again.
- The secret entrance offers lots of possibilities, but the characters first need to find it. Then they need to deal with whatever suitable monster is currently lairing in that cave. Moreover, any number of traps, hazards, and monsters might be guarding the passage leading from the cavern to the holes.
- The characters might also try to keep things entirely legal by tracking down the orc who committed the murder Oppal is accused of. Bringing that villain in might easily clear Oppal's name—and bring the characters a certain amount of notoriety in the city. But where is that orc now? And who else might the characters need to contend with to capture him?
- Pretending to be Oppal's friends or family gives the characters easy access to the doppelganger as they bring in a last meal. Then once they're in the holes, it's up to you to decide how they might pull off a daring escape—including searching for the rumored tunnel from the inside.

#### Oppal's Info
If the characters rescue Oppal from the holes, she gratefully provides information on the whereabouts of Omin Dran's treasure cache, which consists of rare black diamonds mined from the rim of Mount Hotenow. The diamonds are held in a silk bag that's been placed in a false tome titled *A Layperson's Book of Common Knowledge*. Oppal hid the book in a vault beneath the Hall of Knowledge—the local temple to Oghma, god of knowledge, invention, and inspiration.

Like much of the city of Neverwinter, the Hall of Knowledge is currently under repair. Although some of the temple was damaged by the volcano, portions were spared the destruction of the lava flow, including an underground chamber called the Vault of Tomes. That undercroft contains some of the most rare and valuable books in Faerûn outside Candlekeep, and is one of the most secure locations in the city as a result. By disguising herself as an acolyte, Oppal was able to place the false tome in the vault.

On Omin's instructions, Oppal hired a wizard to place a *glyph of warding* (explosive runes) on the false book to keep it from being opened. Also on Omin's order, she doesn't know how to bypass the glyph. The doppelganger knows that Omin expected he would be able to access the diamonds once the false tome was in his possession.

Oppal knows that the vault door has a very good lock, but the door is left open whenever acolytes are moving tomes in and out of the vault (as it was when she hid the book). She also knows that the head priest (known as the grand scribe) at the Hall of Knowledge is a frail and unpleasant elf named Spivey Liethennson (LN male elf **noble**). Grand Scribe Liethennson is a strict taskmaster and does not suffer fools gladly.

Once freed, Oppal is unwilling to assist in any further capers, wanting only to get out of Neverwinter alive. No amount of threatening or cajoling can inspire her to assist the characters. She suggests that they acquire the book, seal it inside something else so as to avoid accidentally triggering the glyph, and leave the city as quickly as possible. They can deliver the goods to Omin at their leisure after that.

#### The Hall of Knowledge
The Hall of Knowledge is a major temple in Neverwinter, acting as a place of learning, a center of socialization, and a repository of government documentation while Castle Never is being rebuilt. Damage to the complex's outer walls and floors has already been restored, while workers now focus on interior walls and decor.

Grand Scribe Spivey Liethennson oversees the temple, ruling his limited domain with all the fervor his fragile body can muster. Acolytes and workers freeze in terror when his labored breathing warns of his approach, because he rarely has a kind word to say. Liethennson longs to leave the city and join his fellow Oghma worshipers in the serenity of Candlekeep. In the meantime, he hopes to impress church elders by running the Hall of Knowledge with an iron hand.

***Curing Lycanthropy.*** If any characters have lycanthropy from their run-in with Moguhl Vloot, Grand Scribe Liethennson can cast *remove curse* for a donation of 50 gp. If he feels indebted to the characters (see "Alternative Entry" below), he might cast the spell for free.

#### Entering the Temple
Anyone can enter the temple to worship Oghma at a shrine on the first floor. Acolytes and lesser clerics are available to perform rituals for a suitable donation. The first floor also contains books and scrolls of common value, as well as public documents moved here from Castle Never. The second floor holds sleeping quarters and private work areas for staff and clergy, while the basement includes storage rooms, private shrines for generous donors, and the Vault of Tomes.

Two **veterans** in the employ of the Neverwinter city guard bar passage to the other floors at all times. The guards deny access to anyone attempting to enter the basement who is not an acolyte, known to be approved for entry, or escorted by a high-ranking priest or Grand Scribe Liethennson.

***Labor Problems.*** The characters enter the Hall of Knowledge at an opportune time. Grand Scribe Liethennson, unhappy with the quality and the pace of the work being done, has recently taken to task the builder overseeing the renovations. Dwarf artisan Kollette Kwarter (NG female dwarf **commoner**) has finally grown tired of the elf's constant griping and badgering.

At any opportune moment as the characters are within or approaching the temple, they see Kwarter drop her tools at Liethennson's feet, make a rude gesture in his direction, and call on her workers to leave. She knows that she and her team can find easier work for more money elsewhere in the city. Quick-thinking characters can seize this opportunity to pretend to be masons, carpenters, or other craftspeople to gain access to the basement level. This doesn't grant characters access to the Vault of Tomes, but it gets them close.

#### Alternative Entry
Characters wanting access to the basement might attempt Charisma (Deception) or Dexterity (Stealth) checks to connive or sneak their way into the area. By pretending to be wealthy donors to the temple, they could also reach the basement with a donation of 20 gp for the party. Give any plan that makes sense a chance to succeed.

***Trouble in the Basement.*** If the players prefer action, an emergency in the temple could assist them in their quest. An eldritch tome stored in the vault has its dweomer suddenly fail, unleashing a burst of arcane energy that animates two statues in the vault. As the characters case the temple, screams and shouts are heard as the statues run amok. The two veterans on guard step up, only to quickly fall victim to the animated statues. The characters can use the distraction to slip into the vault while scribes and acolytes flee, or they can deal with the threat to earn the favor of Grand Scribe Liethennson.

Each of the animated statues uses the **gargoyle** stat block.

#### Entering the Vault of Tomes
Even after the characters have accessed the basement, entering the Vault of Tomes while it's locked down is a challenge. The door to the vault employs a complex three-stage lock, requiring three successful DC 20 Dexterity checks using thieves' tools to open. If the characters take too long to open the lock, staff or clergy might notice them, alerting any veterans on watch.

If the characters defeated the statues, they have the thanks of Grand Scribe Liethennson. He is reluctant to allow anyone other than worshipers of Oghma into the Vault of Tomes, but characters with his favor have an easy time convincing him of their need to do obscure research or similar claims.

Books within the vault are indexed and arranged alphabetically by title. Characters can find *A Layperson's Guide to Common Knowledge* with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

#### Leaving Neverwinter
With the diamonds secured, the characters can leave the city with little problem. Provided they don't wave the diamonds under the noses of the guards while departing, they aren't bothered or taxed. If they report back to Omin with magic, he instructs the franchise's hoardsperson or another suitable character to keep the diamonds safe until delivery.

If the characters dispel or otherwise deal with the *glyph of warding* and open the book, it contains a silk bag with twelve black diamonds inside. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation or Nature) check from any character with a merchant, jeweler, or mining background can assess the value of the gems. A character with experience as a jeweler has advantage on this check.

A successful check determines that while four of the gems are real diamonds (5,000 gp each), eight are actually finely cut smoky quartz (10 gp each). Omin knows that Oppal mixed the fakes with the real diamonds to throw off would-be thieves, allowing her to offer them the quartz while she used legerdemain to retain the valuable ones. Characters who don't know this might sweat a bit as they try to figure out how to explain the situation to Omin.

## The Tortured Tortle Mutiny
The Silent Sound lighthouse sits atop a cliff three days' travel north of Neverwinter, and acts as a navigation beacon to ships traveling up and down the Sword Coast. The shoreline of this often-foggy area gives way to underwater rocks, posing a dire threat to ships. More information on the lighthouse and the fate of its franchise can be found as the characters explore in the "Silent Sound Lighthouse" section below. But before the characters have a chance to explore, they find themselves distracted by disaster on the approach to the lighthouse.

*Like all living things, your franchise needs to be willing to abase itself for coin. Play to your strengths by having law-abiding franchisees stop crimes, while the more chaotic ones commit them.*— K'thriss Drow'b
#### Sailors in Need
Whether they're traveling by land, arriving by boat, or teleporting in, the characters witness a disturbing scene as they first catch sight of the lighthouse.

>>Silent Sound lighthouse finally comes into view, rising atop a rough and dangerous-looking promontory of rock that thrusts up from the beach behind it and juts into the Sea of Swords. If the lighthouse is supposed to act as a beacon, though, something is seriously wrong. Its top is hazy and indistinct, as if a fog was obscuring the lantern room. Also, for a place that's an occupied headquarters, there's a lot of scaffolding along the tower's base, and three large tents are pitched on the slope of the beach behind the lighthouse promontory.
>>
>>Wind and the crashing of waves against the cliffs is loud, but even over that, panicked shouts can be heard. Along the shore next to the beach, tentacles rising from the sea thrash out against a longboat. Three people in the boat are fighting off the tentacles, and are faring poorly.
>>

***Creatures.*** Three **giant octopuses** are attacking a longboat and its crew—Belle Mare, Menard Chatte, and Chalkie Sharke (all CG human **bandits**). Adjust the fight to the length of time it'll take the characters to reach the scene, depending on how they're traveling. But if they tarry for no particular reason, Menard is dragged into the water, never to surface again. A similar period later, a tentacle pulls Chalkie into the drink. Belle then perishes if the characters ignore the fight completely.

***Shore Fight.*** The crew is aboard a 15-foot longboat with a sail. The fight takes place 15 feet off shore, where the water is 10 feet deep. The first 10 feet of the shoreline is difficult terrain because of the waves.

If the characters intercede, the sailors fight alongside them until the octopuses are driven away, or the characters convince the sailors to flee to safety.

***Development.*** The three sailors are from a caravel called the *Tortured Tortle*, presently anchored a mile off shore. Belle is the first mate, and voices her appreciation for the characters' rescue. If they seem like honorable sorts, Belle takes a risk and further asks them for assistance. She admits that she and her crew are smugglers coming ashore to take possession of goods in a nearby sea cave (see the "Treasure" section). But she and the others are at their wits' end in terms of how to deal with the *Tortured Tortle*'s captain, a hard old salt named Athgar Friedson.

#### Trouble at Sea
Friedson is a Northlander who has pushed his crew to more and more dangerous and despicable deeds in recent months. He has even talked about taking up full-on piracy and slave trading to earn extra coin, and the (mostly) good souls aboard the *Tortured Tortle* are looking for a new way to make a living. However, Captain Athgar and his new associate, a cleric of Umberlee called Sister Foam, have threatened to kill any crew members "not brave enough" to take on these new and terrible pursuits.

If the characters care to help, they can challenge Captain Athgar. The (mostly) good members of the crew can handle the bad apples backing Athgar. Certainly, with such aid, the adventurers can handle the captain and his priest! Belle promises that if the characters help, they can have a stake in the *Tortured Tortle*, with her as the new captain. She expresses her willingness to work out any business arrangements for the future.

Regardless of the characters' decision, Belle also reveals that she knows something is wrong at the Silent Sound lighthouse. For at least two tendays, the normally reliable light has been dark. She fears that some sort of magic is in play, because it isn't just the case that the light is out. Rather, it appears to radiate some kind of dark energy. Moreover, she's heard that sightings of spectral figures and will-o'-wisps in the area are on the rise.

In the end, the sailors must return to their ship or risk the captain's wrath against their friends. The characters are left to explore the lighthouse on their own.

***Treasure.*** The smugglers came ashore to retrieve several bolts of rare Calimshan silk to take to an interested buyer in the Moonshae Isles. The five bolts are worth 100 gp each. The characters might find this loot in a nearby sea cave, along with lots of mundane supplies, if all the smugglers perish. Otherwise, Belle recovers the silk before going back to the *Tortured Tortle*, but offers the characters 30 gp from her own purse in thanks for their help.

#### Mutineers
If the characters agree to help Belle oust Captain Athgar, she suggests that they accompany her back to the *Tortured Tortle*. She plans to tell the captain she picked up new crew members and to invite the characters on board, at which point they can attack the captain and the priest. As planned, Belle will lead the rest of the crew against those who side with the captain. It should all be over quickly.

The trip back to the *Tortured Tortle* is smooth, and the longboat sails into position to be hoisted aboard. Belle yells to the watch that she has new crew to bring aboard, and the watch acknowledges the request. This exchange brings the captain—a tall and muscular Northlander—onto the deck. Standing at his side is a short, stocky human female wearing a holy symbol of Umberlee around her neck.

***Creatures.*** Captain Athgar (NE male human **veteran**) is as mean as the ocean is deep. The devotee of Umberlee is called Sister Foam (NE female human **priest**), and she's a good match for the captain in demeanor and ferocity. The captain berates Belle for bringing back useless chum such as the characters, and demands that they leave his ship immediately—without the use of the boat. If the characters try to reason with him, the captain quickly proves how unreasonable he can be by ordering the crew to kill the characters and dump their corpses overboard.

***Chaos of Battle.*** As soon as the characters attack, Athgar and Sister Foam order the crew to defend the ship. In the first round of combat, two sailors (N human **bandits**) attack the characters alongside the captain and priest. By the start of the second round, Belle convinces other sailors to take up arms against those loyal to Athgar. None of the sailors attack the characters thereafter.

As the battle continues, you can decide how the rest of the combat goes with regards to additional help. If the characters are winning handily, a few loyalists might escape the general melee and fight beside Captain Athgar. If the characters fare poorly, Belle or other mutineers could intervene to relieve some of the pressure.

*A lot of people think of piracy as a dead-end job or a last-resort career. This is remarkably shortsighted, as the gig has a startling number of upsides. For example, it's a job that allows you to wear a lot of scarves and sashes. That's rare. What's more, you're never more than two steps from some sort of convenient rope that you can cut and use to dramatically swing into danger.What's more, people don't realize that profit-sharing arrangements are surprisingly common, and there are great opportunities for internal promotion of the dead-sailor's-boots variety. Also? There are a lot of dead sailor's boots, and the resale on those can be very high. Good boots are scarce.*— Viari***Treasure.*** If the characters assist Belle Mare in carrying out a successful mutiny, she rewards them with a red pearl worth 200 gp, as well as a *yellow diamond elemental gem*. Both belonged to the captain. She then asks the crew to transport the characters back to shore so they can continue their mission.

## Silent Sound Lighthouse
Silent Sound lighthouse is a seventy-foot-tall cylindrical tower of mortared stone, with a square base carved into the rock it stands on. The lantern room is enclosed within glass walls and features an open-air catwalk. Map 3.1 shows the layout of the lighthouse tower, which is reached by way of a twisting but safe path leading up from the beach behind it.

The Order of the Stout Half-Pint had been using the lighthouse as its headquarters for two years before that franchise suffered a fate similar to the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. It was six months ago that the order came into possession of a piece of the *Orrery of the Wanderer* called the *rotor of return*, and just over a month ago that their search for lore on the rotor came to the attention of the Six. The Six's attack on the lighthouse actually preceded the attack on Phandalin by a few days, and was similarly headed by archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop. (As a successful franchise, the Order of the Stout Half-Pint has some slack with Head Office, so that their last missed franchise payment didn't draw the same immediate attention as the missed payment from the Phandalin franchise.)

As with the *timepiece of travel*, Hoobur has so far failed to find the *rotor of return*, but he doesn't mind. He has claimed the lighthouse since returning here from Phandalin, finding the basement laboratory to be a perfect place for his experiments. Even as he works for the Six, Hoobur continues to make it look as if he works for Dran Enterprises. The leadership of the Six expects that attacks on two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises will attract the attention of Acq Inc Head Office, and **Splugoth the Returned** wants that attention directed elsewhere while his plan to claim the orrery comes together.

> ##### Free Sailing Ship! or Is It... ?
>If the characters make a deal with Belle Mare and succeed in taking the *Tortured Tortle*, how they benefit is up to you. Before you decide to allow the *Tortured Tortle* and its crew to work for the franchise, think through the potential ramifications, and how you could use them later in your campaign. Like other deals, this one has potential benefits and possible drawbacks. Even if the crew of the *Tortured Tortle* pledges loyalty to the characters and swears off (most) of their illegal activities, much could go wrong.
>
>Perhaps the ship is in sad shape after years of neglect. Can the characters spare 1,000 gp (a tenth of the sailing ship's worth) for repairs? And what happens if the ship gets into trouble and the characters are constantly called upon to rescue the crew and protect their investment?
>
>Authorities across the Sword Coast might also want to arrest the crew for Captain Athgar's misdeeds. If any crew members are caught, the authorities might learn about the ship's business relationship with the franchise, creating potential trouble for the characters.
>

![[063-map-3-1-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### Beachside Tents
On the beach behind the lighthouse, three large tents are set up as temporary lodgings. The members of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint and their staff were living here while preparing the lighthouse for a new round of franchise renovations. Evidence of a fight from many days ago is spread across the grounds, including slashed canvas and broken weapons. Mundane furniture and gear fills the tents, along with kegs of ale, casks of fresh water, boxes of rations, and bundles of arrows. All the tents feature the Dran Enterprises logo scrawled onto them in chalk.

***Treasure.*** In one tent, a locked chest hidden within a provision crate holds some of the treasure of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. Hoobur Gran'Shoop had his undead servants search the tents, but they weren't savvy enough to spot the chest, which requires a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens the chest. Smashing the chest open requires a successful DC 10 Strength check, but doing so breaks 1d4 of the potions within. The chest contains 500 sp, gems worth 250 gp, three *potions of healing*, and a *potion of heroism*.

#### General Features
The lighthouse is old, and the Order of the Stout Half-Pint has been undertaking recurring renovations since they moved in two years ago. Except where otherwise noted, all areas of the lighthouse have the following features.

***Ceilings.*** Ceilings are 15 feet high and flat.

***Light.*** The lighthouse is mostly dark. Two lanterns full of oil hang within each level on the east and west walls. Window slits stand 3 feet above the floor on each level, at the center of the north and south walls. These slits are 3 feet high but only a few inches wide, so they're too small to allow passage or let much more than a little dim light in.

***Resting at the Lighthouse.*** If the characters attempt a long rest anywhere inside or within sight of the lighthouse, an undead patrol of two **ghouls** and four **zombies** interrupts them. A new patrol passes every 6 hours, making finishing a long rest impossible unless the characters leave the area.

#### Front Door
The door leading into the ground floor at the base of the lighthouse is both locked and trapped.

***Fusillade Trap.*** A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that the lock of the stone door is connected to wires that run into the tower's stone walls. This custom-built franchise defense system is rigged to release a rain of arrows from turrets up higher on the lighthouse. The trap can be bypassed by pressing a hidden button on the door, requiring a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. Or it can be disarmed with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If the check to disarm fails by 5 or more, the trap is triggered.

If the trap is activated, each creature within 10 feet of the door must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) piercing damage from the rain of arrows on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap does not reset itself automatically, but it will be restocked with arrows and reset manually by Hoobur Gran'Shoop's undead minions if the characters are away from the lighthouse for more than a few hours.

Once the trap is disabled or triggered, the lock on the door can be picked with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The sturdy stone door can also be smashed open with a successful DC 20 Strength check, or it can be battered down (AC 13, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).

#### Ground Floor
When the characters gain access to the ground floor, they can see what's inside.

>>In the center of this square room carved into the base of the promontory, a circular staircase spirals upward. The area has been emptied of furniture, but a number of parchments and maps are tacked onto the walls. The corpse of a halfling is sprawled beneath one of those maps. It isn't moving. However, the spectral halfling hanging motionless in the air above it is very much in motion as it drifts toward you, moaning.
>>

![[064-04-22.png|right|300]]

***Creature.*** The **ghost** of one of the members of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint (see below) now guards this area, attacking as soon as any character steps into the room or 1 round after the door is opened.

***Development.*** The ghost and the corpse are all that remain of a deceased member of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, Patsy McRoyne. An examination of the body reveals no weapon wounds, but a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Medicine) check finds evidence of necrotic damage. A familiar sigil has been carved into the corpse's chest—a draconic skull pierced by a sword thrust upward through it.

The maps and parchments tacked up along the walls include the following:

- A number of maps show trade routes in the area around the lighthouse, running all the way to Luskan to the north. Among the handwritten marginalia on one map are the words "Dran Ent. secret HQ in Luskan? Threat?" with a circle around that city.
- One parchment is the franchise contract between Acquisitions Incorporated and the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. The franchise was established two years ago, and has been doing well by all accounts.
- A wall calendar with the name "Wizzy" on it records adventures the order has undertaken. It also notes intended headquarters renovations that are constantly behind schedule, given how much time the franchise members spend away from the lighthouse adventuring. One of those adventures was a raid on an old tomb six months ago, where they cleared out numerous monsters and found something noted as a "magic clock."

#### Second Floor

>>The next floor is circular, as the square base cut into the promontory gives way to the upper levels of the tower. The stairway continues its upward spiral from this floor to another. Building implements, tools, and boards line the walls. Three tall wardrobes and four large chests stand among these materials.
>>

***Creatures.*** Hiding in the wardrobes and chests are four **ghouls** made from gnome and halfling corpses of members of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. The diminutive undead burst out to attack when any creature enters this area, surprising anyone who does not succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If any ghoul attacks an elf and notes its immunity to ghoul paralysis, all the ghouls avoid that target thereafter.

***Treasure.*** In one of the chests that a ghoul emerged from, the characters find eleven pieces of black jasper worth 10 gp each. In the pockets of a cloak hanging in one of the wardrobes are a *potion of frost giant strength* and ten *+2 sling bullets*.

#### Third Floor

>>As you step from the stairs into the single room of this floor, a snarling and growling greets you. On opposite sides of this room stand two vicious-looking hounds with black fur. The creatures smell of sulfur and rot, and both wear ornate collars of silvery metal. Each stands within a square scribed onto the floor, ten feet on a side and edged with runes. The rune-marked boundaries appear to push the creatures back as they try in vain to cross through.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **hell hounds** are presently held within magical wards in this area. Hoobur summoned these fiends but has yet to assign them a task, so he keeps them "crated" here. The hell hounds can't leave the rune-bounded areas unless the runes are disturbed (including by a character who enters the warded area), or if the characters activate the runes on the stairs (see "Trapped Stairs" below). The hell hounds can, however, breathe fire on anyone who gets close enough to them.

***Wards.*** A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check made to investigate the wards understands the purpose of the runes, as well as the ways in which the wards can fail (see below).

***Trapped Stairs.*** Runes scribed onto the six bottom stairs leading up to the next level are linked to the runes holding the hell hounds in place. The stair runes can be noted with a *detect magic* spell or similar effect, or a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check.

A character who is aware of the runes and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check discerns that anyone who steps on the trapped stairs releases the hell hounds from the warded areas. Unless the hell hounds are first destroyed, the only way to safely climb the stairs is to disarm the runes with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Failure by 5 or more triggers the runes, releasing the hell hounds. *Dispel magic* can remove the runes from one stair.

It takes a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb the stairwell walls and avoid the stairs. Jumping over all the warded stairs in the curved stairwell requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Failure on any of these checks sets off the runes. If one or more stairs are deactivated with *dispel magic* first, a character climbing or jumping up has advantage on the check.

***Treasure.*** Each hell hound wears an ornate platinum collar, one etched with the name "Wilbur" and the other with "Wilhelmina." Each collar is worth 50 gp.

#### Fourth Floor

>>The circular staircase ends on this floor in a room that contains vibrant decor despite its sparse furnishings—a bed, a dresser, a desk, and a glass tank. Bright paint in a rainbow of colors is splashed on the walls in something that might be a pattern. Garish rugs and tapestries cover the floor and walls. Costume gemstones adorn almost every surface that can contain them.
>>
>>A set of rungs on the south wall gives access to a hatch in the high ceiling. The hatch presumably provides access to the top of the lighthouse and the lantern room.
>>

Resting in the glass tank among wilting plants and countless dead insects is a multicolored **spider** called Rainbow. Rainbow is the familiar of Wizzy Fotz, the gnome wizard who led the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. Rainbow is a dour and dark creature, despite (or because of) its former master having magically painted the spider in rainbow hues.

If the characters find a way to communicate with Rainbow, it speaks in a droll and erudite accent, laced with casual profanity and dripping with sarcasm. If it can't speak with the characters, Rainbow can spin a web to create words, but these are equally derogatory, bitter, and profanity laced. In either case, the spider can pass along the following information:

- Rainbow has been Wizzy's familiar for as long as it can remember. That excruciating and annoying existence could be matched only by a stint in the Nine Hells according to the spider (which claims to have been there once).
- The Order of the Stout Half-Pint was a successful adventuring franchise made up only of gnomes and halflings. Its members had gained enough prestige and capital to acquire the lighthouse, which undergoes an endless spate of renovations.
- A weird gnome named Hoobur approached the group a month ago, asking to join them. When the members of the order let their guard down, the new gnome called forth a horde of undead creatures that slaughtered everyone.
- Since then, Rainbow has remained in this area. The spider can feel that its master is not dead, but is also not truly alive. Rainbow believes Wizzy persists in some sort of half-life at the hands of the gnome archmage.
- A tiefling unexpectedly teleported into the lighthouse a few days after the order had been wiped out. She was spotted by Hoobur's undead minions and captured. Rainbow doesn't know what happened to her after that.

***Development.*** Rainbow knows that the lantern room at the top of the lighthouse allows people to teleport to the secret basement beneath the tower. However, it shares that information only with characters who agree to search for and save Wizzy. Or put the mage out of his half-dead misery. (The spider isn't choosy; it just wants some closure.) Rainbow does not know the current passphrase to activate the teleporting power of the lighthouse lens.

***Treasure.*** Rainbow's glass terrarium is full of dirt, plants, insects, and webs. It also contains the *rotor of return*, buried beneath the dirt in the tank. Rainbow knows the rotor is there but reveals its presence only if Wizzy is dead and the characters haven't found the object on their own. A character who searches the tank and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check finds the rotor. If it is taken before Wizzy is confirmed dead, Rainbow is sullen but makes no argument.

#### Lighthouse Top
The hatch in the ceiling of the fourth floor provides access to the top of the lighthouse. Magical shadow causes this area to be lightly obscured. When the characters arrive, read:

>>This area is gloomy and dancing with shadows. A ten-foot-wide catwalk encircles the fifteen-foot-high lantern room housing the lighthouse's crystal lens. The lens rotates lazily, but rather than shedding light, it emanates an aura of cold shadow. The walls of the lantern room are five-foot-wide panels of glass set with a single glass door.
>>

***Creatures.*** Hoobur has entrusted the protection of the necromantic lens to a **will-o'-wisp** and three **shadows**. The shadows resemble halflings and gnomes, former members of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. These undead remain hidden until the second character gains access to the balcony, at which point they attack. The creatures retreat into the lantern room if necessary (with the shadows slipping through a gap beneath the door), knowing the characters can't enter without some effort (see "Glass Door" below).

***Catwalk.*** A 10-foot-wide stone catwalk set with a low railing encircles the lantern chamber housing the necromantic lens. A character who falls from the catwalk can grab onto the railing with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.

***Glass Door.*** The glass door that provides access to the lantern room is magically locked, and all the glass making up the door and wall is magically reinforced. The lock can be opened with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check or Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A character can also shatter a panel or the door with a successful DC 20 Strength check, or can bash through it. The door and each glass panel has AC 18, 30 hit points, and is immune to cold, necrotic, poison, psychic, and radiant damage.

***Necromantic Lens.*** Hoobur Gran'Shoop has scribed the magic lens atop the lighthouse with faint runes that cause it to radiate necromantic energy. In addition to filling the area with shadow, the lens grants any undead creature at the top of the lighthouse the following benefits:

- It has advantage on saving throws.
- It has resistance to radiant damage.
- The undead regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

***Light 'Em Up.*** Any character who witnesses the effects the lens's shadow has on the undead can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check to assess the lens's magic. With a success, the character understands the properties of the shadow and intuits that a powerful necromantic ritual has transformed the lens.

Once the lens's power has been determined, any character can reverse part of the corrupting ritual with any of the following actions:

- A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check disrupts the flow of necromantic energy within the lens.
- A successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check subtly sabotages the runes scribed into the lens.
- A character can expend one use of Channel Divinity to force divine power into the lens.

For each successful action undertaken to disrupt the lens, its power falters as follows:

- The area around the top of the lighthouse is no longer lightly obscured.
- The lens no longer grants benefits to undead.
- The energy of the lens is reversed for 1 minute, shining out as bright light that fills all exterior areas of the lighthouse within 20 feet. While the energy is reversed, each undead creature that starts its turn in this area takes 11 (2d10) radiant damage. Each creature that isn't a construct or undead regains 11 (2d10) hit points at the start of its turn. A creature that could regain hit points but has died within the last minute returns to life with 1 hit point. (This includes any creatures that have fallen from the lighthouse.)

![[065-04-23.png|right|300]]

***Arms and Armaments.*** The arrows that fuel the fusillade trap seen at the entrance to the lighthouse are restocked in magazines set under the outside edge of the catwalk. This will likely only be important if the characters decide to take over the lighthouse (see "Franchise Downtime" at the end of this episode). But if the trap wasn't triggered, you might also decide that a character who slips from the catwalk and manages to hang on to the railing can redirect one of the magazines toward any threats. Each creature in a 15-foot cone directly in front of the magazine must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Development.*** If the characters learned about the lantern's teleporting qualities from Rainbow on the fourth floor, it's a simple matter to figure out how the lens works. If they didn't learn that information, they can note that the lens continues to pulse with magic even after its necromantic corruption is expunged. An *identify* spell, or a few minutes of study by a character with proficiency in Arcana or who uses *detect magic*, reveals not only evocation magic within the lens (used to produce the magical light), but conjuration magic tied to teleportation.

Speaking a command phrase and stepping into the lens teleports a creature to a fixed destination somewhere nearby. The command phrase can be ascertained from the runes newly carved into the lens with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. (The passphrase is automatically learned if the lens was initially assessed with *identify*. Undead creatures can activate the teleportation power of the lens simply by stepping into it.) A character who speaks the command phrase "Hoobur Osto Draco" and steps toward the lens is teleported into the secret basement beneath the lighthouse. In that basement, Hoobur Gran'Shoop conducts his dark experiments.

(If the characters came up unlucky in gaining information from Rainbow and have no inclination to further investigate the lens, have an undead patrol of four **zombies** step suddenly out of the lens after the fight but before the characters leave this area. Anyone who sees the zombies appear recognizes that the magic lens is the teleportation portal that brought them forth.)

## Secret Basement
The original builder of the lighthouse was a kindly old wizard who enjoyed the romantic idea of living rustic by the sea in his final years. He wanted a laboratory inaccessible to the prying eyes and wandering feet of normal folk. He therefore created the magic lens that allowed him to teleport directly from the top of the lighthouse to his underground workshop.

When the Order of the Stout Half-Pint took over the abandoned lighthouse two years ago, Wizzy quickly discovered the teleporting power of the lens. However, renovating the disused basement laboratory had long remained just another item on the franchise's to-do list, and no one ever discovered the super-secret basement beyond.

After Hoobur Gran'Shoop led his undead minions in the attack on the lighthouse, the gnome archmage used the teleporting lens to inspect the secret basement laboratory, and soon discovered the super-secret basement beyond. Though he didn't explore the super-secret basement, he was delighted to find that most of the equipment he needed to do his work (minus the victims) was already set up for him in the lab. The place was even dark and dreary, just the way he liked it. Not wanting to pass up an incredible opportunity, the archmage decided to make the Silent Sound lighthouse his new home.

During his attack on the lighthouse, Hoobur made sure that his troops captured rather than killed Wizzy Fotz, the gnome leader of the Order of the Stout Half-Pint. When the tiefling Talanatha appeared out of nowhere in her flight from the attack on Tresendar Manor, Hoobur's minions took her alive as well. He later brought these two prisoners to his lab and has been performing magical rites on them, draining their vitality and will to keep them in a state between life and death.

Map 3.2 shows the layout of the lighthouse secret basement and the super-secret basement beyond.

![[067-map-3-2-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### Arrival
When the characters teleport into Hoobur's lab, read or paraphrase the following:

>>A blinding flash leaves an indelible mark in your brain as you step into the lens. When your vision clears, you find yourselves in the corner of a stone chamber filled with laboratory and arcane equipment. Tall bookcases filled with tomes line two walls, while the other walls feature long tables covered with alembics, flasks, cauldrons, beakers, and containers holding weird reagents and components. An iron cage is set against one wall, its door open.
>>
>>Two more tables surrounded by chairs stand in the center of the room. The first contains a variety of humanoid body parts, all on the small side. The second table holds a tiefling restrained with leather straps. She struggles against the bonds with a wild look on her face.
>>
>>Standing near the tiefling's table is an odd-looking construct with an even more oddly placed spigot at the base of its barrel-shaped body. A gnome dressed in garishly colorful clothes sits on a stool nearby, his eyes blank. Another gnome sits next to the first, but this one is most lively and chipper. He wears dark robes and a red fez bearing the Dran Enterprises logo—apparently scrawled in white chalk.
>>
>>"See Wizzy?" the chipper gnome says to the other. "I told you we would have visitors. I felt their presence in the lantern room." He sips from a cup of tea as he beckons to you. "Would you like to have a seat? And can I get you some chamomile tea? My name is Hoobur Gran'Shoop, by the way. Pleased to meet you."
>>

***Creatures.*** Hoobur Gran'Shoop (LE gnome **archmage**) depends on a **keg robot** (see *appendix B*) to defend him. (The construct was originally a servant of the lighthouse franchise.) Wizzy (NG male gnome **mage**) is also under Hoobur's power, and acts as the archmage's unwitting ally. In his current state, Wizzy can cast only cantrips, 1st-level spells, and 2nd-level spells.

![[068-04-24.png|right|300]]

The tiefling—Talanatha Three-Coins from Phandalin—is alive for now. But if the characters fail to act quickly, she transforms into a **vampire spawn** also under Hoobur's control (see below).

*Necromancy as a business model needs more discussion, I think. Who hasn't had that fantasy about having all undead employees? No? Just me? Okay.*— Omin Dran
#### To Fight or Not to Fight?
Hoobur Gran'Shoop is a far more powerful foe than the characters can handle at their current level. Fortunately, he doesn't want to kill them. In fact, the archmage is a big fan of the plucky, can-do attitude that's brought them this far. He was hired—and given a great deal of magic and money—by the Six to wipe out a couple of Acquisitions Incorporated franchises, here and at Tresendar Manor. His instructions were to make it look like Dran Enterprises was responsible. Other than that, he has no dog in this fight.

Hoobur attempts to establish a sincere dialogue with the characters, chatting about the serenity of the area surrounding the lighthouse, the importance of good friends, the relaxing qualities of a good cup of tea, or any other topic that catches his fancy. During the conversation, he drops as many references to Dran Enterprises as possible, implying that the organization is the characters' true enemy. He reinforces any rumors the characters have heard about Dran Enterprises, or spins those rumors if they haven't. This includes the speculation seen on the map on the lighthouse first floor that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters—and thus a sinister presence—in Luskan.

When the talk becomes serious, Hoobur tells the characters he's willing to let them walk away right now, taking Wizzy and Talanatha with them, if they leave him to his work here. The laboratory is such a great space, and the archmage is making incredible strides in understanding the thin veil between the worlds of the living and the dead.

If the characters are quick to accept Hoobur's offer (even just to avoid a fight they know they can't yet win), you get to decide how the freed Wizzy and Talanatha feel about that. You can also decide how to handle the super-secret basement. If you have a sense that the characters will return to the lighthouse at some point to take on Hoobur, you can leave the areas beyond this one to be explored at a later date. Alternatively, if the players and characters seem keen on making Hoobur a lifetime ally, you can have the archmage offer them a first job for friendship's sake—exploring the super-secret basement and clearing out any threats there. See "Secret Door". If Hoobur Gran'Shoop offers the characters the job of clearing out the super-secret basement, he shows them the secret door behind the bookcase. If not, any character who searches the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check notes scuff marks on the floor near the bookcase or spots the hinges on it. The bookcase swivels open to reveal a passage beyond. Talanatha is also aware of the doorway, having seen Hoobur open it to toss garbage into the hallway beyond." below.

> ##### Hoobur as a Recurring Npc
>Hoobur Gran'Shoop, gnome archmage, is thoroughly evil, and most likely a few phalanges short of a hand. But just because a gnome is a tiny bit on the dark side doesn't mean he can't be a useful ally! Make note of the terms on which the characters part ways with Hoobur, whether they leave him in control of the lighthouse or throw down against him. The archmage could turn up later in the campaign with an interesting business proposition, or might work with the characters in an "enemy of my enemy is my friend" scenario. Alternatively, if Hoobur was forced to flee, he might decide that the franchisees are a threat to his livelihood and reputation that need to be eliminated.
>

#### Okay, to Fight
If the characters are itching for combat, Hoobur casts *wall of force* or *globe of invulnerability* to show off his spellcasting prowess. If the characters don't back off, he sighs as he uses *lightning bolt* or *cone of cold* to get down to business. (At your discretion, give Hoobur a spell save DC of 15 and +7 to hit with spell attacks because he's a little out of it. Maybe there's more in that tea than just tea, right?)

![[069-04-25.png|right|300]]

Hoobur is not much into combat, however, and the first time he takes any damage, he snarls at the characters and casts *time stop*. With his extra actions, he pulls and uses a *spell scroll* of *teleportation* to flee somewhere safe, leaving the characters to fight his minions.

The **keg robot** attacks at the first sign of trouble involving Hoobur. Unless you want the characters to claim the construct, it fights until destroyed. Wizzy also joins the fray, but he moves in a stilted and exaggerated manner that shows he's not acting of his own free will.

***Talanatha's End.*** As soon as Hoobur escapes, a glowing draconic skull with a sword piercing it appears on Talanatha's forehead as she struggles against her bonds. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check can tell she's turning into an undead creature. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character knows the group has 2 rounds to stop the transformation. A character within 5 feet of the table must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check to remove the draconic sigil and stop the transformation. If the characters kill Talanatha in the hope of stopping the ritual, the change occurs immediately.

If Talanatha turns into a **vampire spawn**, she's still restrained on the table and needs to succeed on a DC 15 Strength check to break her bonds. Once she's free, she attacks the characters with abandon. If the **vampire spawn** threatens to overwhelm the party, you can say that the manner in which she was suddenly transformed keeps her Regeneration trait from functioning.

***Treasure.*** If the characters force Hoobur to flee, the gnome leaves a number of valuables behind. The equipment in the lab amounts to *alchemist's supplies*, *carpenter's tools*, a *herbalism kit*, a *poisoner's kit*, *thieves' tools*, and *tinker's tools*. Hanging on a hook in the corner is a *cloak of the manta ray*. Hoobur also has two *potions of greater healing*, a * potion of resistance (necrotic)*, a *potion of water breathing*, and a *spell scroll* of *teleport* on his person. (If Hoobur does a deal to have the characters clear out the super-secret dungeon, he offers the cloak and two potions of their choice as payment.)

***Teleportation Panel.*** Where the characters appeared in the empty corner of the room, the wall contains a glowing teleportation panel keyed to the lighthouse lens. Any creature touching the panel is teleported through the lens to the lantern room.

***Developments.*** If Wizzy is knocked unconscious instead of being killed, the gnome mage regains his senses when he awakens. He can remember little about the attack on the lighthouse or the time spent with Hoobur. He does remember hiding the *rotor of return*, which he reveals to the characters at the adventure's conclusion if they haven't found it already.

***Secret Door.*** If Hoobur Gran'Shoop offers the characters the job of clearing out the super-secret basement, he shows them the secret door behind the bookcase. If not, any character who searches the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check notes scuff marks on the floor near the bookcase or spots the hinges on it. The bookcase swivels open to reveal a passage beyond. Talanatha is also aware of the doorway, having seen Hoobur open it to toss garbage into the hallway beyond.

## Super-Secret Basement
The kindly old wizard who built the lighthouse and its underground laboratory went by many names over his long life. By the point at which he decided it was time to slow down a bit, he was simply called Screve. However, he had more than a few other names throughout his career as a slinger of magic, including Brutar the Bloody, Murst the Merciless, and That Wizard Who Fried All Those People in Suzail. Screve was an edgy sort, in other words.

Most of Screve's "normal" wizarding work was undertaken in the laboratory that Hoobur found and utilized. But he also had a secret series of chambers off the main basement where he did some more... esoteric arcane experimentation.

#### General Features
No one has fully explored this area in more than a decade, since Screve left his mechanical creations to sit dormant. The hallways and rooms are dusty, showing few signs of life or movement. Except where otherwise noted, all areas of the super-secret basement have the following features.

***Light.*** The basement is dark. Torch sconces and hooks for lanterns can be found in each room, but no lanterns or torches are present.

***Ceiling.*** The ceilings in areas 1 through 3 are 10 feet high and flat, while the arched ceiling in area 4 is 20 feet high to accommodate the **mechachimera** there.

***Walls and Floors.*** The basement is all worked stone, but the walls and floors have begun to crumble in spots. Cracks and crevices are common, but are too small to admit anything but insects and other tiny vermin.

***Automatic Doors.*** A number of doors in the super-secret basement are activated by placing magically charged disks into special slots. Those doors open automatically, remaining open until the disks are removed. The doors cannot be opened by any other means.

#### Replica Modrons
A number of "modrons" found in this area are replicas crafted by Screve. Each uses the stat block of one type of modron from the *Monster Manual* with these changes:

- The creature is unaligned.
- It lacks truesight and instead has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- It can understand Common but speaks only preprogrammed responses.
- If the modron has a flying speed, the replica has wings but can't fly.
- The modron's Disintegration trait results in the replica falling into a pile of parts—gears, plates, screws, and wires—rather than turning to dust.

Each collapsed modron also spits out a six-inch-diameter magically charged disk that powers the creature, as well as a platinum rod. The disks are of use to the characters as they explore the super-secret basement, and the rods can be claimed as treasure, as noted in the areas where they appear.

#### 1. Out of Service
Opening the secret door reveals a hallway leading to this area.

>>The dust in the hallway is thick, disturbed only by tiny vermin that have settled into a pile of trash just beyond the secret door. At the end of the hall, a chamber opens up, within which leather tarps cover twelve spherical objects placed along the walls. In the center of the room, another tarp covers a larger cylindrical object. Dusty webs cover everything. A metal door stands closed in the center of the adjacent wall.
>>

***Creatures.*** The "spherical objects" covered with tarps are Screve's attempts to create monodrones to serve him. These twelve replica modrons look exactly like their true modron counterparts and use the **monodrone** stat block, with the changes noted in "Replica Modrons" above.

If the characters disturb any tarp covering a monodrone, the constructs all spring to life, whirring and clanking. Issuing a metallic cry of "Intruders!", the **replica monodrones** attack until destroyed.

***Buzz Saw of Doom.*** The cylindrical object in the room's center looks like two barrels placed atop one another, with sharp, circular blades jutting out in various directions. When the **monodrones** activate, so does the buzz saw of doom.

On initiative count 0, the buzz saw moves up to 20 feet in a random direction on rollers, then makes a melee attack against a random creature within 5 feet of it: +3 to hit; 3 (1d4 + 1) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The buzz saw makes no distinction between the monodrones and the characters when it attacks.

The buzz saw of doom has AC 17, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage. It can also be deactivated as follows:

- The device has an easily spotted 6-inch-wide slot on its back, with the edge of a round disk protruding from it. A character within 5 feet of the buzz saw who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check can pull out a charged disk from the slot, causing the buzz saw to power down. This charged disk is identical to the disks that power the replica modrons.
- A character can topple the buzz saw over with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If tipped over, the buzz saw can still attack, but it can't move.

***Treasure.*** Each destroyed monodrone reveals a magically charged disk and a small platinum rod as part of its components. Each rod is worth 20 gp.

***Door.*** The door exiting this area is made of steel, and is closed and locked. Its only features are three 6-inch-wide slots set in a row at its center. The characters can easily note that the charged disks from any fallen modrons fit perfectly into the slots. If a charged disk is placed in each slot, it completes a circuit that automatically opens the door inward into area 1. It also activates the creatures in area 2.

#### 2. Incomplete Circuits

>>As the door opens toward you, a buzzing sound rises from beyond a dusty corridor ahead. At the end of the corridor, a room covered in dust and webs opens up. Six mechanical cubes with arms and legs scurry about, disturbing the dust for what appears to be the first time in years. Each carries pieces of wire, which it attempts to place into gaps between other wires set into the crumbling walls. Another metal door stands along the wall across from the end of the corridor.
>>

***Creatures.*** Four **replica duodrones**, activated by the door opening, are tasked with maintaining circuits in this room, which have become badly corroded over time. Their second task is to remove intruders who attack them or attempt to open the door into area 3. These replica modrons look exactly like their true modron counterparts and use the **duodrone** stat block, with the changes noted in "Replica Modrons" above.

In addition, hidden in the webs on the ceiling are two **swarms of insects (spiders)**, which have come to dominate the vermin food chain in this area.

***Tactics.*** A character must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the swarms hiding in the webs. One swarm drops on the first character to come into the room, gaining surprise if the character is unaware of it. The other swarm lurks on the other side of the room, and attacks in the second round of combat.

Unless they are attacked first, the **duodrones** ignore the characters to start. But if combat with the swarms goes to three rounds, the duodrones assume they are under attack and enter the fight. They target the characters as intruders but ignore the swarms. Or if the swarms are doing a good enough job against the characters, the duodrones could provide comic relief by trying futilely to sweep the spiders away while getting in the way of the characters' attacks.

***Treasure.*** Each destroyed duodrone reveals its magically charged disk and platinum rod. Each rod is worth 20 gp.

***Door.*** The steel door between areas 2 and 3 has no features. However, the characters easily spot four slots on the wall next to the door, into which charged disks can be inserted. Wires run between these slots, this door, and the door to area 1, but the wires on the crumbling walls show several gaps. Spare wires are easily had by digging through duodrone wreckage or pulling them from other areas of the wall, allowing the circuit to be completed. If the characters need assistance in figuring this out, a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to study the walls and assess the duodrones' activities can fill in the details.

When the characters complete the circuit and insert charged disks into the four slots, the door automatically opens into this area, revealing area 3 and activating the mechanical creatures in that area.

#### 3. Recharging Station

>>A buzzing sound and a deep hum rises suddenly as the door opens, and a blast of musty, dust-choked air spills out from the room beyond. That dusty chamber holds three creatures that look like inverted pyramids with mechanical arms and legs, and another creature resembling a cube with wings. All of them work to place parts into two fifteen-foot-wide, floor-to-ceiling, metallic walls at the room's center. Those walls are the source of the hum, and each glows with a faint light. As one of the creatures shuffles through the ten-foot-wide gap between the two walls, it begins to glow as the walls do.
>>

***Creatures.*** The opening of the door has activated three **replica tridrones** and one **replica quadrone**, whose task is to bring a modron charging station—the two metallic walls—back online. These replica modrons look exactly like their true modron counterparts and use **tridrone** and **quadrone** stat blocks, with the changes noted in "Replica Modrons" above.

It takes the replica modrons 5 rounds to reassemble the station. As they make progress, the hum from the station intensifies, as does its glow. After completing that task, the modrons assemble the five charged disks they need for the secret door in the far wall, which takes another 5 rounds. They then open the secret door to check on the **mechachimera** in area 4.

The **tridrones** and **quadrone** attack if they are attacked, if the characters interfere with their tasks, or if any character moves between the recharging station's walls.

***Recharging Station.*** The recharging station functions by pulsing power into any creature or object that moves into the area between the two rectangular walls. In the 5 rounds during which the modrons repair it, the station hums and glows but does nothing more. If the station is repaired, it has the following effects:

- A replica modron that starts its turn within the charging station regains 5 hit points if it has at least 1 hit point.
- A replica modron standing within 5 feet of either of the charging station's walls has advantage on attack rolls.
- Any other creature that enters the area between the rectangular walls must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The characters can sabotage the recharging station, either before or after it is repaired. As an action, a character within 5 feet of either station wall can attempt a DC 15 Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Sleight of Hand), or Intelligence (Arcana) check to disable that wall. On a failed check, the character takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage. Both walls must be deactivated to render the recharging station inert. If one wall is deactivated, any of the replica modrons within 5 feet of the wall can use an action to counteract the sabotage. It takes three such actions to reactivate the wall.

***Treasure.*** Any of the destroyed modrons reveal their magically charged disks and platinum rods. Each of these rods is larger than those previously seen, and is worth 50 gp.

***Secret Door.*** A 15-foot-wide secret door is hidden in the wall farthest from the entrance, and contains five concealed slots for charged disks. If the modrons finish repairing the recharging station, or if the characters sabotage the station, a shower of sparks erupts from the edges of the secret door and its slots, revealing the door. Otherwise, a character who searches the area and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check notes the door or the gaps in the mortar where the slots are hidden.

If the characters insert charged disks into each of the door's five slots, the door automatically opens into this area and activates the creatures in the next room.

#### 4. Mechachimera
This chamber holds a construct chimera, Screve's crowning achievement before he gave up his pursuits in this area.

>>Thin wires set into the walls of the room beyond the secret door buzz with magic, bathing the room in a blue glow. This chamber is filled with disparate gears, pistons, sprockets, screws, bolts, and countless other mechanical bits—all of which twitch and slide across the floor as if drawn together by some unseen force. The pieces connect and entwine to take the shape of a winged mechanical beast with the heads of a dragon, a lion, and a goat.
>>
>>A voice calls out from a dark corner of the room. "We have been here for a long time. Please help us go home." Wrapped in padlocked chains in that corner is a creature consisting of five mechanical arms, like those of a starfish, and which stands on five spindly mechanical legs.
>>

***Creature.*** The **mechachimera** moves to place itself between the characters and the prisoner. It uses the stat block of a **chimera** with these changes:

- It is a construct.
- It has immunity to poison and psychic damage.

In addition to defeating the construct in combat, characters can pull out its charged disks to hinder its attacks. With a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, any character fighting the **mechachimera** notes that each of its heads features a slot from which a charged disk protrudes slightly. A character within 5 feet of the construct who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check can remove a disk, causing one head to power down and preventing it from making attacks. If the dragon head is disabled, the creature loses its Fire Breath. If the goat head is disabled, it loses its horns attack. If the lion head is disabled, it loses its bite attack.

***Prisoner.*** Screve held a **pentadrone** from Mechanus as his prisoner in this area, using the modron as a model for the constructs he was creating. The pentadrone, known as 57EV1E (or "Stevie" to its friends), has been disconnected from the axiomatic mind of Primus, making it a rogue modron. (See the "Variant: Rogue Modrons" sidebar in the modron section of the *Monster Manual*.) It wants to go back to Mechanus and reestablish its link with the rest of its kind.

Stevie is willing and able to help the characters, but it must be freed from the padlocked chains that restrain it. One locked chain secures each of the modron's five arms. A successful DC 13 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens one lock and removes the attached chain. The chains can also be severed (AC 10, 15 hit points, immune to poison and psychic damage) or broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The manner in which Stevie is tightly bound prevents the modron from attacking or trying to break the chains.

***Treasure.*** The **mechachimera** falls apart when destroyed, revealing five large platinum rods worth 100 gp each, as well as its three charged disks. In addition, characters poking through the construct's remains can spot two magic items that were part of its components—a *sentinel shield* and a *Quaal's feather token (anchor)*.

***Development.*** If the characters release Stevie, the modron is grateful for the rescue and happy to share its story. The construct relates the story of how it had been sent to the Material Plane to recover a rogue modron that was spreading chaos, but was captured by Screve. The wizard held the pentadrone prisoner and used it as a model to create replica modrons. (If none of the characters speaks Modron or has some alternative means of communication with the construct, Stevie picked up enough Common from Screve during its years of imprisonment to get by.)

Stevie isn't sure how long it has been separated from the mind of Primus, but it wants desperately to return to Mechanus. You can decide whether the characters can help Stevie with this plight as a side trek or a downtime activity. Alternatively, the modron might have been disconnected from Primus for too long, keeping it a rogue modron that might become a recurring villain or allied NPC.

## Conclusion
After dealing with the threats at Silent Sound lighthouse, the characters attain 4th level! They can take stock of whatever treasure they salvaged from the lighthouse and what information they learned within, then figure out their next move.

If the characters didn't find the *rotor of return* when exploring the lighthouse, Wizzy can reveal where the relic is hidden if he survived. He is happy to give it to the characters as thanks for their rescue. Alternatively, if Talanatha survived, she knows that Hoobur Gran'Shoop spoke of not finding the rotor, and can join the characters in another search of the lighthouse.

#### Talanatha Three-Coins
Assuming that the tiefling Talanatha is rescued, she is both grateful and beholden to the characters. She can fill in any information regarding what happened in Phandalin if the characters have overlooked something, as she can with what the Company of the Golden Mongoose had learned about the orrery.

Talanatha would be keen to work with a franchise whose members are clearly as cool and capable as the characters. However, she's an adventurer, not a follower. As such, she's not suitable as franchise staff but would make an excellent allied NPC or hired troubleshooter (perhaps after joining another franchise). To use Talanatha as an NPC, you can give her the stat block of a **berserker** or **priest** (depending on what use you wish to make of her). Talanatha has these racial traits: She knows the *thaumaturgy* cantrip, and Charisma is her spellcasting ability for this spell. She has resistance to fire damage. She has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. She speaks Common and Infernal.

As a paladin and an iconic occultant franchisee (see "*Company Positions*" in chapter 2), Talanatha would also make an excellent replacement character if a fight against Hoobur Gran'Shoop went badly for the party.

#### Returning the Diamonds
If the characters recovered Omin's diamonds, they need to return the goods. It's up to you whether they have to make a side trek to Waterdeep for delivery, or if Omin sends a courier to retrieve the stones. If the characters lost the jewels, the consequences could be financially dire.

#### The Orrery
With the *rotor of return* in their possession, the characters can undertake additional research into that component and the *Orrery of the Wanderer* as a whole. See *appendix D* for information on the rotor, which can be revealed as you determine.

## Franchise Downtime
The most important piece of information the characters take away from this episode is the "evidence" that Dran Enterprises was involved with the attacks on both Acquisitions Incorporated franchises, back in Phandalin and at the lighthouse. The rumor that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in Luskan can be repeated by both Wizzy and Talanatha, setting the stage for the next episode. If the characters need further prodding to think about heading for Luskan, you could also have the orrery housing provide a mental hint that at least one more of its components has recently been sensed north of the lighthouse, and relatively close.

All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the "*Franchise Tasks and Downtime*" section in chapter 2.

#### The Luskan Connection
Making use of scrutineering, research, carousing, or schmoozing during downtime can all yield up hints confirming that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in the city of Luskan—and adding rumors suggesting that the organization has recently been engaging in conduct even more secretive than usual. Such activities can also preview some of the information on Luskan presented in *episode 4*.

#### Modron in Need
The **pentadrone** Stevie wants to travel back to Mechanus, and the characters could assist by using downtime or franchise tasks to make that happen. Research or schmoozing might gain information from knowledgeable sages regarding existing portals to Mechanus, or unique rituals that can open a temporary portal.

If the characters are successful in helping Stevie get home, the pentadrone thanks them by removing components from itself that reassemble to function as an *axiomatic weapon*, a rare magic item that requires attunement. When an attuned wielder hits a chaotic-aligned creature with this weapon, the target takes 1d6 extra damage of the weapon's type.

#### Our Very Own Mechachimera
A character trained in Arcana can study the **mechachimera's** design if its components are laboriously collected and taken from the basement. Over time, a similar construct could be used as an offensive upgrade to the franchise's headquarters, either as part of future franchise advancement or with the headquarters modification franchise task.

#### Business Is Expanding
Having a small castle estate in Phandalin is cool. But having a lighthouse on the Sword Coast might be even cooler. If it seems like the thing to do, the characters could use the franchise restructuring or headquarters modification activities to officially ask permission to relocate their franchise to the Silent Sound lighthouse. (This assumes that Hoobur Gran'Shoop was driven from the basement, and that the characters are prepared to deal with the possibility of him coming back.)

Even if the characters don't want to officially change territories, nothing prevents them from quietly checking out the commercial landscape in the area. Characters searching the sea caves along the cliffs near the lighthouse might find that a variety of ne'er-do-wells use them as places to hide from naval pursuers, stow contraband, secure prisoners held for ransom, and engage in other nefarious activities. Joining in on (or getting a percentage of) such activities could be set up with the shady business practice activity—possibly connecting to any deal the characters have recently struck with the newly installed captain of a fast ship.

#### Living the Good Life
Characters not wanting to flout the law (or at least not to do so outside their own territory) could instead clear out smugglers and other riffraff along the coast. Doing so as part of a philanthropic enterprise could get them in good with the authorities in Neverwinter or Luskan.

Taking over the lighthouse also provides the opportunity for a philanthropic enterprise. The light is a warning beacon for ships traveling the coast between Neverwinter and Luskan, but it needs someone to keep it running. Before the Order of the Stout Half-Pint moved in, the authorities in Luskan and Neverwinter struggled to entice anyone to live at the remote lighthouse, given the amount of dangerous bandit and pirate activity in the area. If the characters take over the lighthouse or arrange for it to be staffed, they'll earn the favor of Neverwinter, Luskan, and possibly even the Lords' Alliance for their generosity.

## Continuing the Adventure
While the characters are engaged in downtime and franchise activities, Omin Dran makes contact. He embraces the characters' reports from Phandalin and the Silent Sound lighthouse as proof that Dran Enterprises is involved in the attacks against Acq Inc franchises, and that its agents are willing to kill to claim the components of the *Orrery of the Wanderer*. However, something about that approach feels inconsistent with Dran Enterprises' normal approach to acquisition. A ruthless attitude and wanting Acquisitions Incorporated taken apart and absorbed into its own corporate space is one thing, but doing it one franchise at a time seems odd. As such, Omin wants more information before committing to reprisals or confrontation.

The characters are directed to go to Luskan to confirm that Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters in that lawless city. If they do, they then need to find and infiltrate the operation, learning as much as they can about the plans of Acquisitions Incorporated's biggest business rival!
---
# Episode 4: Dran Enterprises
![[070-04-27.png|right|300]]

The attacks on Acquisitions Incorporated franchises have left signs indicating that Dran Enterprises is involved. The characters (now 4th level) head to Luskan, seeking to find that organization's secret headquarters, infiltrate it, and determine what Dran Enterprises is up to—and what plans they have for the *Orrery of the Wanderer*.

The search for the headquarters takes the characters first to the rough-and-tumble Fishbone Tavern, then to Arla Razortongue, a disgruntled Dran Enterprises ex-employee running a well-known peg and hook shop. After dealing with thugs sent to quiet Arla, the characters learn the location of Dran Enterprises' secret headquarters, and can plan their infiltration.

That headquarters is a seemingly small and unimportant ship at the Luskan docks. But Dran Enterprises' magic has filled the ship with portals leading to some of the faction's many franchises, ships, and business locations. When the characters visit, those portals lead to:

- A dead ship being consumed by the power of the Far Realm—which quickly threatens to consume the characters as well.
- A faction warehouse whose overworked attendant will help them only if they help her.
- A Dran Enterprises cargo ship caught in a raging storm, and which will founder on rocks unless the characters lend the crew a hand.
- Another cargo ship whose well-armed crew will finish the characters off in short order unless they make their way through the rigging unseen.
- A Dran Enterprises pirate crew under attack by undead at a remote dock.
- An array of merchant barges that must be crossed while moving along a busy river.

Only by traveling through a sufficient number of these portals can the characters key themselves to activating the portal to Dran Enterprises' true headquarters—a palatial ship named *The Maverick*. There, they are met by a Dran Enterprises operative who is aware of their quest, and who informs them that Dran Enterprises in fact has nothing to do with the attacks against the two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. Moreover, Dran Enterprises is also aware of the dark power of the *Orrery of the Wanderer*—and its operatives have collected two of the orrery's components, hoping to keep that power in check. But the characters are not alone as they seek this information. Operatives of the Six are already within the portal network, and are racing to claim the orrery components collected by Dran Enterprises before the characters do.

## Traveling to Luskan
The City of Sails is located far to the north of the Sword Coast, and the journey there can be as eventful as you desire. If the players are hankering for random encounters, the wild lands of the North can certainly oblige them. Or you might wish to have the journey pass in relative peace while the players coordinate franchise tasks left over from the previous episode.

Luskan rests upon stone escarpments on either side of the icy River Mirar. Three bridges, named Upstream Span, Dalath's Span, and Long Span, cross forty feet above the river to connect the two sides of the city. The Open Shore docks sit on the northernmost edge of the river, while Dragon Beach holds docks to the south. As they seek out Dran Enterprises' secret headquarters, the characters start in the south and work their way to the Open Shore docks.

A key aspect of Luskan life is its rule by groups known as Ships. Five High Captains each rule a Ship made up of pirates and other Northlanders. Ship Kurth, under High Captain Beniago Kurth, is the First Ship, which controls the city's docks and trade. Ship Baram is the Second Ship, operating the fishing industry. Third Ship Suljack leads piracy and raiding, handing down less-desirable opportunities to Fourth Ship Taerl. Fifth Ship Rethnor acts as the city's guard—an unprofitable enough duty that many of its members look for other ways to earn coin.

The order of mages known as the Arcane Brotherhood is the other major power group in Luskan. Though its members include ambitious arcanists of any and all genders, the newly restored order maintains its original name as a reflection of its past power—and as a sign that it seeks to restore that power once again.

If you want to make Luskan a bigger part of your campaign, more information about the city can be found in the *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*.

## Searching for Dran Enterprises
The characters' main goal in this episode is to find Dran Enterprises' secret headquarters. However, owing to that organization's habit of breaking the legs of anyone who talks about company business, this information is hard to come by. Thankfully, the characters are able to learn that Dran Enterprises employees often frequent a specific tavern in Luskan, giving them a starting point for seeking the information they need.

The characters can learn the name and location of the Fishbone tavern in any number of ways, including talking to other tavern owners, seeking out merchants and mercenaries who've done business with Dran Enterprises, and the like. Two example encounters are provided to help the characters find the tavern. You can add similar encounters to increase the complexity of the search as desired.

#### Trouble at the South Gate
The characters are assumed to enter Luskan from the south. Modify the text below as needed to fit their arrival.

>>A sharp, icy wind whistles through South Gate as you enter Luskan. The shops and taverns lining the main thoroughfare of the City of Sails are as battered and weathered as the grim customers entering them. At first glance, the city's reputation as a den for pirates and raiders appears well earned.
>>
>>Just ahead of you, a wagon has broken down in front of a tavern. The elderly human driver calls out for help, but passersby ignore her. As she calls out once more, the tavern door behind her opens and two guards toss a young male human in bright clothing out into the street. He tumbles into the old woman, sending both of them sprawling to the ground. The door closes, then opens once more as a mandolin comes flying out of the tavern.
>>

If the characters want to lend a hand, they have ample opportunity to step up. Catching the mandolin requires a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, and if no party member tries to do so, it crashes to the ground at the characters' feet.

The tavern is called the Last Dregs, and the owners don't care for strangers. Allow the characters a quick look in if they like, but there are no leads to Dran Enterprises to be found here.

> ##### Where Is the Orrery?
>At some point before the party arrives in Luskan, ask the players whether their characters are bringing the orrery housing and any components with them, and if so, who carries the relics. If they plan instead to secure them elsewhere, ask about that location and their security measures. For the purpose of the adventure, it's best if the characters keep the orrery components with them, rather than leaving them at headquarters. (Certainly, reminding the characters of what happened to the last two franchise headquarters that held orrery components should be enough to inspire them to hold onto the components themselves.)
>
>You don't need this information now, but it becomes relevant in episode 5. Asking now gives the players time to forget you asked!
>

***Failed Minstrel.*** The minstrel Noriel (NG male human **commoner**) has spent a rough month in Luskan. He believes that his father was once a pirate working for one of the Ships, but he's had no luck so far tracking him down. Noriel's poor sense of fashion, nervousness, and lack of musical skill have not helped his efforts. An impressionable (and starving) teenager, he faithfully serves anyone who takes him under their wing, and can provide comic relief as desired.

Having been thrown out of countless taverns, Noriel knows the general rumors talking of how Dran Enterprises has a secret headquarters somewhere in Luskan. He also knows the even more widespread rumors of how Dran Enterprises punishes anyone who talks about the organization's business. However, he has heard and shares that many Dran Enterprises employees wander the northern part of the city in their off hours.

> ##### Always Be Branding
>As long as they're in Luskan, the characters might take the opportunity to try to extend their franchise's reach into the city. A formal presence in this far-flung territory is far beyond the scope of their charter of operations, naturally. And savvy franchisees might have heard rumors that Head Office is working to open a franchise in the City of Sails. However, clever players could work to increase their own franchise's notoriety and add a few more customers without unduly violating the terms of their contract. You might tie such attempts to future franchise tasks or downtime incorporating the shady business practice activity, as the characters try to keep an official distance from any Luskan opportunities.
>

***Driver in Need.*** Dabahl (NG female human **commoner**) works as a wagon driver out of Neverwinter, and her hired help all fled after a failed bandit attack during her most recent run north. She made it safely to Luskan alone, but her wagon wheel has just given out.

Repairing Dabahl's wagon takes at least 1 hour and requires a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) or Wisdom (Survival) check. The DC drops to 10 if the characters spend 20 gp on replacement parts, if any character knows the *mending* cantrip, or if any character is proficient with land vehicles.

Dabahl cannot afford the repairs or offer to pay the characters for their service, but in her gratitude, she can share that Dran Enterprises has a nefarious reputation. The location of their headquarters is a closely guarded secret, but the organization's employees are said to favor a tavern frequented by fishers. Dabahl sells her goods to Ship Kurth and could also introduce the characters to its merchants, though she does not have any influence with them.

#### The Broker
With a couple of initial clues at hand, the characters can start the search in earnest for the tavern frequented by Dran Enterprises employees. Unfortunately, most folk in Luskan are smart enough to not talk about Dran Enterprises too openly, and the characters are rebuffed or ignored during their initial inquiries. Eventually, though, the party is referred to Eriss (N female gnome **commoner**), said to broker deals between guilds and other organizations.

Eriss works with Ship Taerl, and can be found in a small but well-maintained curio shop on a busy street just north of the city's central bridge, Dalath's Span. An enormous half-orc **thug** named One-Tusk stands guard outside the shop. Eriss is inside, polishing bottles containing miniature ships. She claims that these were once real ships, forced into the bottles through powerful magic. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check suggests that this story isn't worth a ship-in-a-bottle's 100 gp sale price. However, Eriss answers the party's questions only if they buy one of the models or another equally expensive curio from her shop.

***What Eriss Knows.*** Speaking with Eriss is not without risk. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check confirms that the gnome is a broker for criminal organizations, trading information and helping stolen goods find their ways to buyers. A result of 15 or higher on this check also imparts that like most fixers, Eriss is hesitant to engage with the enemies of any company she wants to stay on good terms with.

When the characters inquire about Dran Enterprises, the gnome asks why they seek the organization. If she gets any hint that the characters are opposed to Dran Enterprises, she sends a message warning operatives of the organization as soon as the party leaves her shop. If the characters suspect this, they might need to attempt DC 15 Charisma checks (using Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion, depending on the situation) to talk Eriss down.

If the characters stay on her good side, Eriss confides that she doesn't know where Dran Enterprises has its headquarters. However, she can share that the employees of the organization sometimes gather at a watering hole known as Fishbone Tavern. They keep a low profile, but the tavern's bartender, Fryer, might be able to identify a member of Dran Enterprises or help the characters further.

> ##### Extending the Luskan Experience
>NPC scenes can encourage cooperative roleplaying, so give the players lots of space to discuss how to help characters like Noriel and Dabahl—and then run with the players' ideas. A desire to help Noriel could lead to helping the bard land a paying gig at a tavern, or seeking out one of the Ships or the loremasters of the Arcane Brotherhood to learn of his father. Helping Dabahl could lead to an encounter with a guild of teamsters or a disgruntled repair shop employee. Such efforts could lead to additional roleplaying scenarios, to which you can add ability checks and combat encounters as desired.
>
>Of course, some players will simply ignore Dabahl and Noriel. That's okay. Let the characters' reactions take things in a different direction, and have a different NPC provide the same information. However, always feel free to have Dabahl or Noriel make another appearance. Maybe the two team up, with Noriel helping improvise the repairs (soon to fail at any time), while Dabahl teaches Noriel a song or two. Their story can move forward, intersecting with the party's story at a later opportune moment.
>

## Fishbone Tavern
Any fisher or laborer in the north of the city can provide directions to Fishbone Tavern. None of the NPCs currently at the tavern know the location of Dran Enterprises headquarters, but they can provide pointers to someone who does.

>>Fishbone Tavern is located a few blocks from Luskan's Open Shore docks, close enough that you can smell the sea air and hear the cries of gulls swooping over the fishing ships. A few lazy snowflakes fall from a cloudy sky as you approach the tavern's front entrance—and a sign decorated with an actual rotting fish nailed to a board bearing the tavern's name. Standing before the door is an immense figure who beams a smile missing most of its teeth. He squints his eyes as if trying to make sense of you. "What... uh... what's your business here?"
>>

![[071-04-28.png|right|300]]

The dimwitted bouncer is Zurb (CG male human **thug**). Zurb's job is to keep any potential troublemakers out of the raucous tavern, including enemies of Dran Enterprises. Fortunately for the party, he can be fooled very easily with some skillful roleplaying or appropriate ability checks.

Zurb knows (and absolutely shouldn't share but does) that employees of Dran Enterprises drink at the Fishbone frequently, though he hasn't seen any of them in a few days. He ponders a while on how that's rather unusual. Zurb can suggest the characters talk to Fryer the bartender to figure out why. (She earned that name when she hit a would-be-thief with a searing-hot frying pan.) Zurb can also describe any of the tavern's regulars, including warning the characters that Rakeem can't be trusted.

When the characters decide to enter, Zurb opens the door for them. If the characters have befriended him, Zurb announces them as "really nice people that talked a lot." This causes Fryer to shake her head in weary disbelief.

>>The interior of the Fishbone Tavern is cramped and shadowy. Only two of the eight tables are occupied, one by two fishers and another by a lone figure in a dark, leather-patched cloak. One wall holds a small, smoky fireplace, while a long bar of dark-stained wood stands along the opposite wall. Standing behind the bar under oval plaques set with yellowing fish skeletons is a heavyset human bartender. She pours ale for a half-elf seated at the bar, quietly engaging him in conversation.
>>

#### Friends of Dran Enterprises
Fryer (N female human **commoner**) is the owner of the Fishbone Tavern. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher might hear her refer to the half-elf as Rakeem as she talks to him. She is in the service of Dran Enterprises, receiving payment for keeping an eye on the organization's employees and reporting any lack of loyalty to their management.

Although Fryer is tight with Dran Enterprises, she carries a certain amount of guilt over an incident from a few months ago. She reported a former friend and Dran Enterprises operative named Arla Razortongue to her bosses for speaking out about the organization's unethical practices. (See "The Peg and Hook" below for more on Arla.) Recent word on the street is that Arla continues to be a thorn in Dran Enterprises' side—and that she's been marked for exile or elimination. A character might sense Fryer's remorse over having sold Arla out with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check, and could encourage her to share what took place and where to find Arla with appropriate roleplaying.

Rakeem (N male half-elf **spy**) is a regular drinker at the Fishbone, a friend to Fryer, and a professional snitch. Though not in the employ of Dran Enterprises, Rakeem tries to sell any information he overhears regarding the organization. If the characters talk openly about Dran Enterprises while Rakeem is anywhere in the tavern, he overhears them and alerts company operatives as to the characters' intentions.

A character notices Rakeem spying on the group with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight or Perception) check. Rakeem is not eager to fight, though, and once confronted, he can be persuaded or intimidated into keeping anything he heard to himself—at least until the party leaves town. He might also be convinced to share what he knows with appropriate bribes or well-worded threats.

Word on the street is that Dran Enterprises has "turtled up," retreating into wherever they hide due to some trouble known to the company's higher-ups. Rakeem doesn't know what that trouble is, but one person who keeps her ear to the ground about Dran Enterprises is Arla at the Peg and Hook (see below). He can share Arla's story and provide directions to her shop.

#### Working-Class Rumors
The two fishers drinking at a central table are Milo and Tortuk (both N male human **commoners**). Both are deep into their cups, lamenting their inability to find employment on the better fishing boats owned by Ship Baram. Even inebriated, they know enough to be wary at the idea of talking about Dran Enterprises to strangers. They do offer up, though, that they haven't seen any Dran Enterprises employees in going on a tenday now. It's an easy guess that there's a big operation in progress, but neither fisher knows what that might be.

The lone figure sitting at a corner table is Velos (N male human **bandit**), nursing a glass of rum and rubbing his hand. A pirate by trade, Velos tries to conceal that his hand is turning black with infection after an injury during a recent raid. Without treatment such as a *lesser restoration* spell, he will lose the hand, and he can't afford treatment. Velos knows Arla and her story, and knows that he and his hand will be bound for the Peg and Hook shop before long.

If the characters help Velos and mention their interest in Dran Enterprises, he shares that he recently overheard a melancholy employee talking about how a friend "got invited to headquarters but accidentally took a wrong door. They managed to scoop up what was left of him." His gratitude also makes him a solid potential hire, especially if the franchise has future business in Luskan.

#### Moving Things Along
If the characters need help connecting the dots, Rakeem could make an obvious mistake such as tipping his stool over from trying to strain to hear the party. Or Velos could fall unconscious from his wound, allowing the characters to see his predicament and win Fryer over to their cause with some beneficial healing. Alternatively, an NPC the characters have previously confided in might appear (perhaps Noriel or Dabahl), asking loudly whether the characters have found Dran Enterprises yet, and provoking a noticeable reaction from Fryer and Rakeem.

Once the characters have learned about Arla from any of the possible sources at the Fishbone, they can travel to her shop.

## The Peg and Hook
Arla Razortongue (CG female human **spy** with iconic Dran Enterprises employee features; see "*Iconic Faction Features*" in *appendix B*) had a good thing going as an employee of Dran Enterprises. So when she was fired from that organization, the need to start over again in the cutthroat environs of Luskan inspired her to think outside the box. Way, way outside. Given the number of seedy sailors that call the City of Sails their home port, she knew that a shop helping pirates with limb replacements would always make money. However, she felt that a hook was more useful as a replacement for a leg (instead of the traditional peg leg), and that a peg was more useful to replace a lost hand.

Dran Enterprises ignored Arla at first, convinced that she would be a failure. Surprisingly, though, the plucky entrepreneur managed to convince enough pirates to try out her unconventional system that her business thrived. She has since developed a number of unique attachments (hook shoes, peg arm accessories) that provide surprising functionality—and even replaced one of her own hands and a leg to prove her point.

#### Talk First, Fight Later?
When the characters approach the Peg and Hook, first decide whether their previous investigation has alerted Dran Enterprises. If they allowed Rakeem to eavesdrop and report their conversations, alerted Eriss the broker of their antagonistic intentions, or asked too many strangers how to find the organization, a strike team is already inside the shop and attacking Arla. Go straight to "Dran Strike Team" below and roll for initiative.

If the characters were discreet in their inquiries, Arla is alone in her shop and can be approached in any way they want. Then run the "Dran Strike Team" encounter as the characters prepare to leave the shop.

![[072-04-29.png|right|300]]

#### Talking to Arla
Arla initially assumes the characters are customers, and points out various arm peg accessories, hook foot options, and other products she has developed. She then whips out a bone saw and asks which of the characters she can help first.

When she realizes the characters aren't customers, Arla is disappointed, but she's open to their questions. She despises Dran Enterprises, and is willing to help anyone who opposes that organization. Conveniently (for her), she's also looking for investors to help her expand her burgeoning business. She initially asks for 1,000 gp for her information, or half as much if the characters bring her a paying customer. She can be talked down to 500 gp, or 250 gp with one customer.

Velos the pirate (from the Fishbone tavern) is a potential customer for Arla, but many others can be found around the city. Talking a stranger into getting a hook for a leg or a peg for an arm is best left to humorous roleplaying, but could also be accomplished with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Getting a limb replaced costs 25 gp, and Arla offers no-interest payment plans.

#### The Hidden Headquarters
Arla shares that Dran Enterprises' true headquarters is an expensive and well-appointed flagship called *The Maverick*. The ship sails constantly, rarely putting into port for security reasons. But the organization has a much more subtle and just as secret alternative headquarters that hides in plain sight at the heart of Luskan.

A tiny and unassuming ship named *Dangerous Business* is always moored at the Open Shore docks, and is more than it appears. The ship houses a series of magic portals leading to various Dran Enterprises warehouses, ships, marketplaces—and to *The Maverick* itself. Each of *Dangerous Business*'s magic portals is set with and activated by a differently shaped and colored stone. Employees memorize where each stone leads, but the configuration changes on a regular schedule. Moreover, employees are subject to enchantment magic that prevents them from sharing the information. Arla does not know the current portal configuration.

> ##### Being Noticed
>As the characters rise in level and franchise rank, NPCs will begin to take notice of them, and not just vice versa. Rather than the adventurers constantly thinking about which NPCs might make solid prospective business partners, those NPCs might start showing up later in the adventure to pitch the franchise on commercial deals. Keep note of which NPCs the players have the most fun interacting with, and keep those NPCs in mind for future engagement. Conversely, the NPCs the players most actively dislike could become foes, joining Dran Enterprises or the Six, then appearing later in the campaign to pay the characters back for some real or imagined slight.
>

#### Dran Strike Team
A Dran Enterprises strike team has been sent to deal with either the characters or Arla, depending on how the characters got here. The team is led by a fixer named Hoffman (LN female human **veteran** with iconic Dran Enterprises employee features; see "*Iconic Faction Features*" in *appendix B*). If Dran Enterprises has been alerted to the characters' investigations, the strike team is already inside the shop when the party arrives, preparing to take Arla out. Otherwise, the strike team has been sent coincidentally to shake down Arla, as some of the higher-ups at Dran Enterprises aren't happy with their disgraced employee's success. In that case, the strike team enters the shop just as the characters start to leave.

The team's primary objective is to convince Arla to abandon her business and leave town. If she won't, they have orders to kill her. Hoffman focuses on attacking Arla, castigating her verbally and physically for being a traitor to Dran Enterprises. In combat, Arla's shortsword attacks take the form of either her sharpened leg hook or a retractable blade attached to her arm peg.

Hoffman is backed up by three operatives named Pieter, Marks, and Molley (each a N male halfling), each using the **spy** stat block. The three spies use the mobility afforded by their Cunning Action to change targets, and can be easily goaded into focusing on the characters and ignoring Arla.

#### Treasure
The strike team members are dressed in fur cloaks and leathers, and their weapons and armor are well maintained. They have the equivalent of a priest's pack and an explorer's pack between them, plus a total of 180 gp.

Hoffman wears a round metal pin bearing the symbol of Dran Enterprises, and which radiates abjuration to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. The pin allows passage through the portal doors on the Dran Enterprises ship (see the next section).

## Infiltrating Dran Enterprises
*Dangerous Business* is a small sailboat with a single cabin rising from the center of its deck. It is docked alongside two larger sailing ships (named *The Ghost* and *The Rogue*). All three ships are owned by Dran Enterprises, with the two larger ships housing fishers, pirates, and others in the company's employ.

Map 4.1 shows the layout of the docks where the characters make their initial approach to Dran Enterprises headquarters.

![[073-map-4-1-dm.jpg|right|300]]

#### Racing Against the Six
As the characters seek an approach to *Dangerous Business* and the portals within, they are unaware that they are competing against the Six, who have already infiltrated the ship and are seeking Dran Enterprise's main headquarters aboard *The Maverick*. The Six are initially at no more advantage than the characters are in their search for the headquarters, but the characters' actions might tip that balance one way or the other.

During this part of the episode, you'll track a one-off mechanic called "failure points," which are used to represent the race against the Six and determine which side finds the headquarters first. The resolution of that search is described in the "*On Board The Maverick*" section, but the characters will have opportunities before that to realize they are competing against the Six. When that becomes clear, you can underscore any situation in which the party earns a failure point, letting the players know that accumulating too many points means that the Six will pass through the final portal and arrive at *The Maverick* first.

In addition to you tracking the number of failure points, each time the party earns a failure point, you gain a pool of two **guards**. You can add one or more guards from your pool to any scene within the "Portal Nexus" section of this episode. Whenever these guards appear, they enter the scene aware that Acquisitions Incorporated and the Six have infiltrated their territory, and are actively looking for intruders.

> ##### The Other Kind of Winning
>As always in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, keep an open mind to alternative ways to advance the story, and don't worry if the characters happen to lose an important fight. The face-off against the Dran Enterprises strike team is a tough encounter, and might not go the way the characters expect.
>
>If the entire party is defeated or surrenders, Hoffman can order the characters to be kept alive and loaded onto a cart to be taken to Dran Enterprises for questioning. This won't see the characters taken directly to the company's main headquarters, but could provide an alternative means of reaching *Dangerous Business*. Once on that ship, one of the spies might mistakenly open the portal door leading to the Far Realm horror, with the strike team members alone dragged into that deadly trap to allow the characters to gain their freedom. See "Infiltrating Dran Enterprises" for more information.
>

#### Dangerous Business
This humorously small ship is watched over by four **guards** that stand a silent vigil around the cabin. The ship can be reached from the main dock or the smaller jetty leading out between *Dangerous Business* and *The Rogue*. A single door opens up into the cabin.

The area of the docks around the three ships is patrolled by two groups of Dran Enterprises operatives, each consisting of four **guards** and four **mastiffs**. Crates and equipment piled along the docks can provide cover, potentially allowing the characters to make a stealthy approach. Various booms and scaffolding can also grant access to the larger ships, from which the characters can work their way to *Dangerous Business*. The players might also devise any number of ways to talk their way on board. Dran Enterprises is often hiring, so the characters could pose as expert sailors or specialized consultants. Give the players and characters the freedom to develop a plan, gather information, and fail or succeed spectacularly!

If any of the guards see the characters as a threat, they shout out, raising the alarm and imposing one failure point. The alarm alerts all other guards on the docks, and can draw an endless supply of reinforcements from other ships over time. As such, the characters should realize quickly that a stand-up fight will involve more foes than they can handle.

The party can retreat and come back when the heat dies down, but this delay imposes another failure point. Or they can push past any threats to get to *Dangerous Business* and the portals within.

## Portal Nexus
When the characters step through into the cabin on *Dangerous Business*, read:

>>The small square cabin's interior is far larger than its exterior, opening up as an oval room thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide. Crumpled on the floor before an iron door on the far side of the room, the body of a guard lies in a pool of blood. Standing closed between you and the body, six other oval-shaped iron doors are the only features in the room. Each door has a heavy latch that bears the insignia of Dran Enterprises, but no lock is visible. Above each of the iron doors, a differently shaped and colored glowing stone is set.
>>

The characters can examine the dead guard or investigate the doors and stones. However, the amount of time they have to do so depends on whether they had other guards in pursuit. If the characters were pursued, give them a round or two to investigate the portal nexus, then have an increasing number of guards burst into the area each round, forcing the characters to enter a portal.

If the characters infiltrated the ship without raising the alarm, they have five minutes before they hear a guard patrol approaching. If they leave this area to go back onto the deck of *Dangerous Business* for any reason, they immediately attract the attention of nearby guards.

#### Dead Guard
The dead guard is a male half-orc. Lying on his chest is a black business card bearing unintelligible symbols. More notable is that the unfortunate guard's brain has been removed from his shattered skull. The guard was killed by the mind flayer leading the Six operatives (see "Portal 4" and later for more information). The condition of the guard's head makes it impossible to talk to him with *speak with dead*.

Aside from his grievous head wound, the guard's body is untouched except where his shirt is torn over his chest. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check confirms that a brooch or pin was ripped from that location. If a character thinks to check, the size of the round metal pin claimed from Hoffman after the fight with the Dran Enterprises strike team matches the size of the torn hole. (If the characters didn't claim the pin from the strike team and you haven't already arranged for a replacement to be found, this guard has a second pin in his pocket.)

#### Portal Doors
Each portal door is made of reinforced iron. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the doors are mundane, but that each is magically trapped. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of evocation on a door's latch. If a latch is opened by anyone not wearing the round metal pin bearing the symbol of Dran Enterprises, the trap goes off. Each creature within the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Each trap can be disarmed with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

Each of the seven doors has a glowing semiprecious stone above it, carved into a different shape: a green turquoise square, a red feldspar triangle, a white pearl circle, a purple amethyst oval, a blue aquamarine rectangle, a black hematite pentagon, and an orange tiger-eye hexagon. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of conjuration on the space beyond each door and on each of the stones.

The stones are coded markers indicating which doors lead to specific portals. That coding is changed regularly, with the portals reassigned to different locations and the stones swapped around to help keep their destinations a secret. As such, a portal still functions if its stone is removed, and a stone can be reattached to a door with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Placing a stone over a different door makes it harder for the operatives of the Six to know which doors they've already gone through as they make use of the portal network. Swapping one or more stones thus removes one of the party's failure points. If the players don't work out that the stones can be moved, a character infers this with a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

***Treasure.*** If the stones are removed, they lose their magical properties but are worth 25 gp each.

## Portal Encounters
Each portal door leads to a different encounter. Opening any door transports all characters in the portal nexus into the area beyond, with the entrance portal disappearing behind them. The characters must navigate the scene that takes place in the new location, then find an exit portal (another iron door identical to the doors in the nexus) to return to the portal nexus. (Portal 1 is an exception, bringing the characters back automatically.) Eventually, the characters find the portal leading to Dran Enterprises' headquarters in this way.

As an advanced security measure, the magic of the portal network prevents a creature from gaining access to the headquarters on board *The Maverick* without a certain amount of experience traversing the network. As such, the first three portals the characters access will never lead to the headquarters.

The current destinations of the portals are noted on the Portals table. You can choose encounters you favor, or roll on the table to see where the characters end up, rerolling any locations already visited. For the first three destinations, roll a d6 to prevent the characters from reaching *The Maverick*. For subsequent destinations, roll a d8. Alternatively, you can allow the characters to reach the headquarters ship (see "*On Board The Maverick*" below) any time after they've returned from three other destinations.

With the exception of the Far Realm horror, the specific locations of portal encounters are not detailed here. If the characters ask about where they are in any given encounter, or if they're inclined to venture outside the encounter area, the choice of location is up to you.

##### Portals
| d6 or d8 | Portal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Far Realm horror |
| 2 | Guarded warehouse |
| 3 | Raging storm |
| 4 | Amid the rigging |
| 5 | Pirates versus zombies |
| 6 | River barge crossing |
| 7–8 | The Maverick |

![[074-04-31.png|right|300]]

#### Just Cut to the End
If the players are particularly clever, they might come up with novel ways to shortcut the search for the headquarters portal. Perhaps they use *detect thoughts* on a Dran Enterprises operative who knows which stone currently marks the headquarters portal. Maybe exceptional roleplaying allows them to talk an operative into using that portal while the characters watch. If this happens, the first time the characters try to use the headquarters portal, they are shunted back into the portal nexus.

Any Intelligence (Arcana) check made to read the portal's magic reveals that the way forward is blocked except to those with experience using the portal network. The characters must pass through three other portals first, but you can say that their attempts to access the headquarters portal have locked it down temporarily, preventing the Six from accessing it. Remove one failure point from the party's total.

#### Portal 1: Far Realm Horror
A month ago, an encounter with operatives of the Six led Dran Enterprises to try to fight that group using its own dark magic. Sadly, that attempt failed, and this portal now remains tied to a pocket dimension channeling the power of the Far Realm. Danger lurks on the other side of the door, whose stone has been marked as off limits for Dran Enterprises employees. If a character opens this door, read:

>>As the portal opens, a pulse of magic draws you forward. The door vanishes and you stand within an impossible scene. The deck of a ship opens up around you, but the shifting sea to all sides is the color of bruised flesh, roiling beneath a clear sky filled with unfamiliar constellations. Suddenly the door to the ship's main cabin explodes out in a pulse of sickly ethereal light. With a horrid slurping sound, writhing tentacles spill forth through the open doorway and lash toward you.
>>

This self-contained dimension is fueled by the power of the Far Realm. Planar instability prevents characters from moving beyond the immediate area of the deck (including jumping off the ship or fleeing belowdecks).

***Creature.*** The mass of writhing tentacles is a Far Realm horror known as a **chaos quadrapod** (see *appendix B*). It uses its Chaos Cloud at the start of combat, then surges forward to lay into stunned characters. Each round, it focuses its grappling ability on whichever characters dealt it the most damage in the previous round.

If any part of the chaos quadrapod is pushed back through the door, it can be forced to return to its void of origin if the door is closed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If this happens, any creatures it has grappled are automatically released.

As soon as the chaos quadrapod is killed or sent back through the door, the unstable magic of this portal draws the characters back to the portal nexus, giving them no time to explore the ship. However, a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the strange surroundings and the chaos quadrapod as products of the nightmarish Far Realm.

#### Portal 2: Guarded Warehouse

>>As the portal opens, you feel a lurch as its magic wraps around you. The door is gone suddenly, and you are standing in a hot and humid warehouse filled with crates stacked to the ceiling. Windows high up on the walls let in light and reveal what look like tropical trees outside. The crates are organized in mazelike rows, making it hard to see how far the warehouse spreads. From somewhere to your right, you hear humming, running footsteps, and the squeak of a wheeled cart drawing closer.
>>

***Warehouse Worker.*** The guardian of this warehouse is **Dagdra Deepforge** (NG female dwarf), a long-time employee of Dran Enterprises. She has the iconic documancer feature (see "*Iconic Faction Features*" in *appendix B*) and uses the **priest** stat block with these changes:

- She wears half plate (AC 15).
- She has these racial traits: Her speed is 25 feet. She has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. She has advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage. She speaks Common and Dwarvish.

**Dagdra** wears a tabard that is so worn that the bottom half of the image it bears is missing. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) or Wisdom (Perception) check determines that the holy symbol of Moradin was once on the tabard, but only a bit of the flame remains. She pushes a cart loaded with Chultan-themed tourist keepsakes and collectibles. All bear the logo of Acquisitions Incorporated, but these are actually knock-offs created as part of Dran Enterprise's ongoing efforts to undercut Acquisitions Incorporated's reputation and success.

Dagdra has made a lot of bad choices in her life, from leaving her church to joining Dran Enterprises and getting stuck with warehouse duty. Her job mostly involves running from one row of crates to another, filling orders for customers and grouping them for retrieval by other Dran Enterprises employees. She receives her instructions through her documancy satchel.

If Dagdra notices intruders, she is startled and begins to call for help. The characters must either silence her, overcome her quickly, or convince her to hear their story. Fortunately, Dagdra is open to reconsidering her life choices and allegiances—and is having a really bad day. If the characters agree to help her complete her tasks, she reveals the location of the exit portal.

***Lending a Hand.*** Helping **Dagdra** complete her tasks involves a specific process and a number of ability checks, all at DC 12. When an order comes in, it appears magically on Dagdra's ledger, three items at a time (see the Dagdra's List table below). The dwarf calls out the three items, and a character must make an ability check using one of the skills noted for an item to locate that item in the warehouse. Each check represents the act of either physically searching for the item or understanding the characteristics of the item. The narrow space between piles of crates means that only one character can search for each item.

Once three items are located with three checks, any character must then make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to place the three items in Dagdra's cart as the dwarf races around the warehouse.

The items are found and collected regardless of the success or failure of the checks. But if the characters fail three or more of the four checks necessary to collect a group of items, their lackluster performance causes a **bearded devil** productivity specialist to appear and attack the party (including Dagdra) for 1 round. The devil then vanishes, and the party gains a failure point.

##### Dagdra's List
| Item | Ability Check |
| Chultan bold-tan body lotion | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) |
| Feathered "dino fury" handaxe | Strength (Athletics) or Intelligence (History) |
| Voodoo doll of Omin Dran | Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) |
| Lil' explorers first medicine kit (any item in the kit inflicts the poisoned condition if swallowed) | Wisdom (Medicine or Survival) |
| Guidebook to famous Chultan day spas (none of which exist) | Intelligence (History) or Charisma (Deception) |
| Jim Darkmagic's feral beast pacifying spray (incites rage in any beast exposed to the spray) | Wisdom (Animal Handling) or Charisma (Persuasion) |
| Triceratops action figure (has four or more horns) | Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) |
| Genuine Batiri goblin pottery set (not at all genuine) | Intelligence (History) or Wisdom (Perception) |
| Môrgæn never-miss arrow set (always misses) | Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Wisdom (Survival) |
| Acquisitions Incorporated t-shirt and underwear gift set | Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Charisma (Performance) |
| Donaar Blit'zen Chultan fibers floss kit | Intelligence (Nature) or Charisma (Persuasion) |
| Viari "swinging chandelier" diorama | Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Charisma (Persuasion) |

![[075-04-32.png|right|300]]

Once all twelve items have been found, Dagdra leads the characters to a stack of crates that conceals the exit portal. Due to the standard Dran Enterprises enchantments placed upon her, she can't share any information about how to reach *The Maverick*. She stays behind to slack off for the rest of her shift, but might show up at some later point if you wish. Having decided to make a new life for herself, Dagdra makes an excellent potential employee for the franchise.

If the characters did not befriend Dagdra, they must search the endless maze of crates for the exit portal. This search can reveal the various products noted above (which the characters are free to steal and later resell using the shady business practice activity). Either way, unauthorized movement in the warehouse causes a **bearded devil** to appear and fight the characters until destroyed. Only then can the exit portal be found. The party gains one failure point as a result of the time they spent in the maze.

#### Portal 3: Raging Storm

>>The moment you open the door, magic wraps around you, drawing you through the portal and into a raging storm. You stand on the deck of a ship that heaves from one side to the other as waves crash over the rails. Crew members pull lines and tie down cargo, as a heavyset, bearded captain calls out orders. Looking across the bow, you see tall spires of rock emerging through the storm—and the ship is headed straight toward them!
>>

Captain Nuxoll (NG male human **veteran**) and the crew of the Dran Enterprises cargo vessel *Liar's Luck* are overwhelmed by the storm. Though they recognize at once that the characters are not in Dran Enterprises livery, they are in no mood for a fight and need any help they can get. The characters can determine what needs to be done on their own, or the captain or first mate twins Travis and Benham (both NG male half-elf **commoners**) can suggest useful actions.

Each of the tasks below involves one or more characters attempting specific ability checks to aid the ship's crew during the storm. All six checks must be attempted by the characters. The players can decide which characters make which checks, but a character cannot make a second check until all the characters have made one check. A character with the sailor background has advantage on these checks. If the characters fail three or more checks, the party gains one failure point.

***Lower Main Sails.*** The storm's winds will shatter the mast if the sail can't be brought down, but its lines are tangled. A successful DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check is needed to reach the tangled lines, followed by a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to untangle them. A crew member named Streams (CG female halfling **commoner**) provides advice to any character attempting this task. A character who fails is tangled up and takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage.

***Secure the Rum.*** Casks of rum are rolling around the decks, creating a short-term danger to the crew—and a longer-term danger to the crew's morale if too much of the rum goes overboard. A successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check helps first mates Travis and Benham secure the casks. If a character fails, they are slammed by an errant cask and take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

***Wave Lookout.*** The captain needs a sharp eye to call out when waves are about to strike the ship. An intern named Heian (LN female half-elf **commoner** wearing a shirt emblazoned with "Aeofel Lives") is currently on this duty, but she needs help. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check provides timely warning for the next set of waves. If the character's check fails, the next check made by any character to aid the ship is made with disadvantage.

***Calm the Beast.*** A **tiger** being transported on the main deck in a large metal cage is frightened by the storm and trying to escape. Its keeper Bendari (N male elf **druid**) needs help. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check calms the tiger. Failure results in the tiger making one attack against the character through the bars of its cage.

***Lift the Curse.*** A crew member named Incindorita (CN tiefling **acolyte**) claims that the ship has been cursed. They insist that one of the newcomers to the ship must offer up a prayer to calm the storm. There is no curse, but a character who succeeds on a DC 11 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check can go through the motions to calm Incindorita and inspire the crew.

***Spot the Rocks.*** Captain Nuxoll needs someone to mark the distance and direction to the spires of rock along the shore, allowing the ship to pilot around them and to a calmer bay beyond. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check allows the ship to make a safe passage, or a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check can give the captain the confidence to navigate the treacherous waters. If the check fails, the ship shudders as it grinds against rocks, and each creature on board takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

***Calmer Waters.*** After all six checks have been attempted, the ship passes through the storm. The crew hails the characters as heroes (or, if they failed, at least appreciates their attempt to help). Captain Nuxoll forgives the characters for infiltrating the Dran Enterprises portal network, and agrees to pretend that the crew never saw the party. He allows the characters access to the exit portal, which is located in his chamber.

While passing through the captain's chamber, the characters can clearly see a logbook filled with records of Dran Enterprises trade transactions, which is worth 250 gp to Acq Inc Head Office. A character can steal the logbook with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failed check, the captain and crew members spot and prevent the theft, and each character takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the beating they endure as they escape through the portal.

#### Portal 4: Amid the Rigging

>>The moment you open the iron door, a tug of magic leaves you clinging shakily to a triangular foretop platform, high above the deck of a gently swaying cargo ship. From your vantage point forty feet above the deck, you can see dozens of crew members below. All wear the livery of Dran Enterprises, and most carry swords and crossbows. Rigging and rope ladders connect your platform to the crow's nest in the middle of the ship. Similar rigging connects the crow's nest to a platform at the aft of the ship. On that far platform, you see an iron door—the exit portal.
>>

Out of sight of the ship's crew, the characters face no immediate threats but are nonetheless in a difficult predicament. The most obvious resolution is to try to cross the rigging in stages—first reaching the crow's nest, then continuing on to the aft platform and the exit portal.

At different points during the crossing of the rigging, the characters might attract the attention of crew members on the deck. The first time the characters are spotted, the party gains one failure point, and each character comes under attack by two crew members firing crossbows (use the **bandit** stat block). If the characters are spotted during the first stage of the trek across the rigging, the attacks repeat during the second stage, though no additional failure points are gained.

***Reaching the Crow's Nest.*** Crossing the rigging requires a successful DC 13 group check using Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If at least half the characters succeed on the check, all the characters make it across unseen, with characters who failed checks being grabbed and aided by the other characters.

If more than half the characters fail the check, each character who failed slips from the rigging but manages to hang on. The characters must then succeed on a DC 12 group Dexterity (Stealth) check to prevent the commotion from drawing the attention of those below. If at least half the characters succeed, the party reaches the crow's nest unseen. If the check is a failure, crew members on the deck spot the characters.

*Big Daddy Donaar's Yum Yum Hut began as a braggadocious endeavor masterminded by one Donaar Blit'zen, when taking over the operations of the Dran & Courtier and attempting to rebrand for the night. Though the endeavor was an overall disaster, the brand remains unnervingly strong. Folks travel far and wide to sample Yum Yum Hut wares and merchandise. I yearn to know why.*— Omin Dran***Crow's Nest.*** As the characters reach the crow's nest, have the two lead characters attempt DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) checks to spot Bardok the ship's cook (N male human **commoner**) currently lounging there. He wears an apron that reads "Big Daddy Donaar's Yum Yum Hut," which is the first thing visible if he is spotted. Bardok is too mellow to care about intruders, so that if the characters approach him carefully, they discover he's a big fan of Acquisitions Incorporated and is willing to help them out. The characters could instead handle Bardok in other ways, but if the initial Wisdom (Perception) checks are failed or Bardok is attacked, the startled cook cries out and alerts the crew.

***Trade Route Maps.*** When the characters reach the crow's nest, even if they raised the alarm, they have time to look around. On the main deck below the crow's nest, a female elf dressed in green leather armor has been studying a map of the Sword Coast marked with trade routes. A number of other maps are stuffed into a backpack at the foot of the mast.

The characters can attempt to steal the backpack and the valuable trade route maps within. Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to reach a favorable position in the rigging, followed by a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to use some kind of rope-and-hook setup to hoist up the backpack. A *mage hand* cantrip can also be used to retrieve the pack, and the players might come up with other suitable ideas.

If the backpack is claimed, it holds maps worth 500 gp to Head Office. If only one of the checks succeeds, the characters still gain the maps but a crew member spots them if they are not already spotted. If neither check succeeds, the crew is alerted to the characters' presence if not already alerted, and each character comes under attack by two crew members firing crossbows (use the **bandit** stat block).

***Aft Platform.*** Traversing the rigging and the rope ladders from the crow's nest to the aft platform requires another DC 13 group check using Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). Once the characters reach the aft platform, they face one final barrage of attacks if they've been previously spotted. They can then step through the portal.

As the characters step through the portal, read the following, making adjustments as necessary if they have already seen the Six operatives:

>>Even as your group reaches the aft portal, you see another group appear through the foredeck portal. Five humans surround a tall, purple-skinned creature in black and purple robes—and which has four tentacles where its mouth should be. Oddly, those tentacles are tied together into a stylish handlebar mustache. The creature's companions fire arrows and swing down the rigging to do battle below. As your portal begins to close, the tentacled creature looks up to coldly watch you.
>>

Choose one of the characters to receive a telepathic message from the mind flayer: "I will consume you and your companions. Your end comes soon." More information on this Six agent can be found in "*On Board The Maverick*" below.

#### Portal 5: Pirates Versus Zombies
Opening this door brings the characters into the middle of a battle with undead. Map 4.2 shows the setup of the dockside pirate fight.

![[076-map-4-2-dm.png|right|300]]

>>As you open the iron door, the magic of the portal wraps around you, pulling you onto the stern of a large galleon. The door behind you vanishes as the noise of a raging battle rises. A horde of zombies surrounds a dozen Dran Enterprises pirates, who are fighting for their lives. The ship is moored at an old and decaying dock, with a single building visible against a forest of thick trees. In the trees beyond the building, you can see a freestanding iron door with the oval shape of a portal entrance.
>>
>>No zombies are present on the land, though they swarm every part of the ship. One group of undead turns in unison in your direction as they spot you. Then a strong voice calls out as the ship's captain, wearing a flamboyant feathered hat and wielding a hammer decorated with seaweed, shouts to be heard. "Rally to me side, me crew! We fight still! Fight for our lives! No curse shall bring us down!"
>>
>>The captain smashes a zombie with her hammer, then pulls a scroll from a satchel and reads words of power. A thunderous boom shatters the zombies around her, though more quickly press in. Several pirates call out: "Rally to Captain Torwyn!"
>>

The ship's hard-fighting captain is Aela Torwyn (LN female dwarf **priest** with no remaining spell slots and the iconic documancer feature; see "*Iconic Faction Features*" in *appendix B*). She brought a curse down on her ship, the *Kraken's Lament*, when she found the hammer she wields. (That hammer uses the statistics for the priest's mace attack.) Dedicated to a dark god, the weapon causes those it slays to eventually rise as undead that seek their killer. Torwyn does not realize this, merely believing that some dark curse affects the ship.

***Creatures.*** The characters have an immediate problem with the group of six **zombies** that initially engage them in battle. Once those are defeated, other options present themselves.

***Quell the Curse.*** Any character caught up in the zombie attack who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check sees that the undead are drawn to the dark glow of the captain's magic hammer. If Torwyn throws the hammer overboard into the sea, half the zombies follow it, reducing the forces the characters must face and ensuring the pirates gain the upper hand. However, convincing the captain requires a compelling argument and a successful DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

***Keep a Low Profile.*** The characters can ignore the plight of the crew and work their way toward the docks and to the portal. This requires moving past three **zombies** and one **ogre zombie**, which are facing off against a lone pirate named Davena (N female human **bandit captain** with 12 hit points remaining). The characters can help Davena or they can sneak past and leave her to her doom with a successful DC 10 group Dexterity (Stealth) check. If the characters haven't made the connection between the hammer and the zombie attack, Davena can be overheard muttering about the curse, and how she's sure it's caused by the hammer Torwyn recovered from an old shipwreck.

***Join In.*** The characters can rally to the captain while helping the crew. Pirates Fallinoor, Goldie, Whiskey, and Wemp (all human **berserkers** with 8 hit points remaining) are trying to reach the captain but face twelve **zombies** in their way (or half that number if the hammer was abandoned). Defeating the zombies helps to unite the pirates, the characters, and the captain, so they can work more effectively against the horde.

Once they rally, the pirates and the captain working together destroy one zombie per round. The characters have advantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and the zombies have disadvantage on saving throws.

***Aftermath.*** If the characters fought more than two groups of zombies but did not help the crew achieve victory, the party gains a failure point. If they stayed and helped the crew, Captain Torwyn thanks them effusively, and tells them that if they ever need a ship near Luskan, they can call on the *Kraken's Lament*. Once off the ship, the characters can easily reach the portal, then return to the portal nexus. If the characters ignored the pirates to head straight for the portal, remove one failure point from the party's total and have the characters think about their life choices.

***Treasure.*** In thanks, Torwyn and her crew offer the party a *wand of magic missiles*, a *+1 vicious rapier*, and a *rope of entanglement*. The rope is seemingly made of seaweed.

#### Portal 6: River Barge Crossing
This encounter brings the characters into direct contact with the operatives of the Six who are also traversing the portal network. Map 4.3 shows the initial setup of the river barge crossing.

![[077-map-4-3-dm.jpg|right|300]]

Read the following, making adjustments as necessary if the characters have already seen the Six operatives:

>>When you pull open the iron door, the view beyond shows another place—and you are suddenly there, the door disappearing behind you. A grassy slope leads down to the banks of a slow-moving river. A number of barges decorated in bright colors move up and down the river, bearing merchants crying out to attract customers. Those customers move from the river bank to the nearest barge, then carefully hop from barge to barge until they reach the merchant they want. On the opposite bank, you can see a small outhouse set with an oval iron door.
>>
>>A flash of light draws your attention to the right, where some fifty feet away from you, another group exits a portal that vanishes behind them. The group consists of five humans and a tall, purple-skinned creature. That creature's face has tentacles where its mouth should be—with those tentacles oddly tied into a stylish handlebar mustache. The creature wordlessly looks at two archers accompanying it, who draw their bows. Its three other companions break into a run toward the riverbank as the creature vanishes with a popping sound.
>>

Roll initiative. Having seen the characters (or having seen them again), the mind flayer has used its *plane shift* ability to get back to the portal nexus. There, it prepares for the assault on the Dran Enterprises headquarters, leaving its lackeys to try to get to the outhouse portal before the characters. Of the four human **scouts** among the Six operatives, two stay behind and fire arrows at the party, while the other two scouts and a human **cult fanatic** race toward the barges.

The intention of the Six operatives is to cross the river barges as quickly as possible and reach the portal before the characters. The running scouts focus on crossing, though they use their shortswords against any character who jumps into the same or an adjacent barge. The cult fanatic races across the barges as well, but casts *spiritual weapon* as soon as possible. He then uses spells such as *command* or *hold person* on any character who gets a commanding lead.

The river is 85 feet wide and filled with 10-foot-wide barges. At the start of each round, a barge moves either left or right 1d4 × 5 feet, either drifting with the current or being poled against it. The movement of the barges adds an unpredictable element to the characters' attempts to get across the river.

Each barge holds a merchant and 1d4−1 customers, and all its area counts as difficult terrain. Characters in one barge can jump to a barge within 5 feet without an ability check. However, each barge is filled with different wares, so that some of the barges require checks by both the characters and the Six operatives to successfully cross them. See the Barge Contents table for more information.

Characters are free to try to swim across the river, but doing so while avoiding the shifting barges requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check for each move made to swim. Any character in the water also attracts the attention of the **giant poisonous snake** from barge 1.

Between the characters and the Six, the first group to have half its members reach the riverbank wins the race and gets to the portal first. If the characters lose this race, the party gains a failure point.

##### Barge Contents
| Barge | Merchandise | Complication |
| 1 | Produce | The barge contains nothing of note, but the first creature to cross it attracts the attention of a **giant poisonous snake** in the water. The snake surges onto a barge to attack and uses its swimming speed to follow the creature from barge to barge, continuing to attack until it is killed. |
| 2 | Fortune-teller | The fortune-teller asks for a donation. A character who drops one or more coins (no action required) gains advantage on their next d20 roll. |
| 3 | Weapons | A creature on the barge can find and purchase (or steal) any weapon in the *Player's Handbook* as an action. One of these finely crafted weapons grants advantage on the first attack roll made with it. |
| 4 | Fireworks | As an action, a character can use the fireworks to create a fire hazard for a pursuing creature. Any creature entering the barge must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage. (The Six operatives don't think to do this.) |
| 5 | Alchemist | A creature moving through this cramped barge must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or crash into a shelf and be doused in alchemical fluids and potion reagents. Roll a d4 to determine the equivalent potion effect: 1—*potion of diminution*, 2—*potion of growth*, 3—*potion of healing*, 4—*potion of poison*. |
| 6 | Hot Noodles | The cantankerous customers on this barge heave bowls of hot noodles at anyone pushing past them: +3 to hit; 4 (1d6 + 1) fire damage, and the character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, the character takes the damage again. A successful saving throw ends the effect. |
| 7 | Monkeys and small pets | One of the many monkeys on this barge throws a banana peel at any character moving across it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. |
| 8 | Flowers | The florist becomes furious at any character moving across the barge, ordering that character to slow down and attempting to trip them. The character must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. |

## On Board The Maverick
When the characters have traveled through three other portals, they are able to finally make their way through the portal leading to Dran Enterprises headquarters. This portal can conveniently be the next one the characters pick after returning from the third portal, unless you want to have the characters run through more portal encounters.

When the characters enter the headquarters portal, read:

>>At last, you step through the iron door that leads into a palatial room on Dran Enterprises' headquarters ship. A placard on one richly polished wooden wall reads, "The Maverick." Two dazzling chandeliers, fine paintings, and lacquered chairs and tables set with gold trim decorate this opulent and expansive study. Large, curved windows to all sides reveal that you are below decks and far out at sea, the ship's wake extending behind it under clear skies. But you are not alone.
>>

Who the characters find in this room depends on how well they navigated the portals. Total the failure points earned by the party and consult the following table.

| Failure Points | Outcome |
| 0–2 | The characters arrive first |
| 3 | The characters and the Six operatives arrive at the same time |
| 4 or more | The Six operatives arrive first |

#### First to the Meeting
If the characters beat the Six operatives here, the only person in the room is a businesslike lizardfolk wearing a collar, a bow tie, and spectacles. Bracus (N **lizardfolk** with the iconic hoardsperson feature; see "*Iconic Faction Features*" in *appendix B*) studies the characters, touching his fingers to his chin as he invites them to introduce themselves. He then states his own name, confirming that he is in the employ of the unparalleled Dran Enterprises.

Bracus shares information with the characters, pausing to allow for questions and posing queries of his own. He's interested in what the characters encountered in the portal network, and responds favorably to any talk of assisting Dran Enterprises staff. He might ask what aspirations they have, or what it's like working for Omin Dran and Jim Darkmagic. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

![[078-04-35.png|right|300]]

- Bracus has been aware of the characters and their franchise since the first time any of them made use of the orrery components the party holds. (If the characters have not used any of the components, it's been the process of drawing them together that has enabled Bracus to get a sense of the party's activities through the orrery components in his possession.)
- Dran Enterprises normally views taking over failed Acquisitions Incorporated franchises as a sound investment decision, salvaging those franchises for parts and turning them into proper businesses. Nothing personal, of course.
- In response to talk of what brought the characters to him, Bracus says he understands how Acquisitions Incorporated might have come to believe that Dran Enterprises was responsible for the destruction of its franchises. Nothing could be further from the truth.
- The true culprit is an enigmatic group known as the Six. They seem to be linked to dark gods and the Far Realm. Dangerous stuff.
- The Six came into the possession of the *far gear* just over a year ago—one of the components of the *Orrery of the Wanderer*. Operatives of the Six are now actively seeking the orrery's other components, hoping to rebuild it for some dark ritual. But Bracus believes that even recovering a few components could be enough for the Six to accomplish their goals.
- In an attempt to foil the Six, Dran Enterprises secured two of the orrery's components—the *chronolometer* and the *dimensional loop*. Dran Enterprises also knows that the last unclaimed component, known as the *wheel of stars*, has been securely stored in the northern holdfast known as Horn Enclave, and is under the protection of the dwarves who dwell there.
- Bracus is aware that the Six are attempting to gain access to the headquarters portal, and suspects they will arrive at any moment.

Bracus takes the characters' measure during the conversation. However, as long as the characters stop short of killing the lizardfolk immediately, the imminent appearance of the Six convinces him that the enemy of his enemy is now his friend. Reaching into his hoardsperson *living loot satchel*, Bracus retrieves the *chronolometer* and the *dimensional loop*. He then offers both to the characters in exchange for them defending him when the Six operatives arrive—as they do only moments later. See "Operatives of the Six" below for more information on the fight with the mind flayer Szorrulax and its minions.

#### Right on Time
If the party arrives at the same time as the Six, roll initiative! Szorrulax prioritizes killing Bracus during the fight, forcing the characters to try to save the Dran Enterprises employee. If Bracus is killed, Szorrulax flees with his *living loot satchel* and the orrery components at once. If the characters save Bracus, defeat the Six operatives, and force Szorrulax to flee, they gain the components and the information noted above. If Bracus dies, they might still find a valuable book and some treasure, as described below.

#### Unfashionably Late
If the Six operatives arrive at the headquarters first, Szorrulax easily defeats and kills Bracus. When the characters arrive, Szorrulax is claiming Dran Enterprises' two components, having destroyed the lizardfolk's *living loot satchel* to empty its contents. Roll for initiative, but Szorrulax's first act is to *plane shift* away.

All is not lost, though. Once the characters defeat the remaining foes, they can investigate the cabin. In the spilled contents of Bracus's satchel, they find a book entitled *Great Dwarven Halls*, with a page turned down. It mentions the dwarves of Horn Enclave as being noted for their work of securing items of great value. Written in the margin is the note: "The wheel of stars, hidden by its creator." They also find the treasure noted below, since Szorrulax doesn't have the time to take it.

![[079-04-36.png|right|300]]

#### Operatives of the Six
Szorrulax is the **mind flayer** the characters might have previously seen in the portal network. It has the iconic secretarian feature (see "*Iconic Faction Features*" in *appendix B*) and braids its tentacles together into a handlebar mustache. If Szorrulax kills anyone, it immediately drops a black business card set with unintelligible symbols onto the body as a calling card.

Accompanying the mind flayer are the Six operatives who survived the portal 6 encounter (originally four **scouts** and one **cult fanatic**). If all those foes were killed in that encounter, Szorrulax has two **bandits** with it—a pair of guards held back from previous encounters, and who are now the last survivors of the Six's forces.

In battle, Szorrulax uses Mind Blast on as many characters as possible, making sure that Bracus is in the blast if the lizardfolk is alive. The mind flayer prioritizes killing Bracus before turning to other targets, but it has no interest in a fair fight. It uses *plane shift* to escape if it can seize the components or if it is badly wounded, leaving its lackeys behind to deal with the characters.

#### Treasure
In addition to the book, the study holds 30 pp, 150 gp, two pieces of pink coral (100 gp each), a small gold bracelet (50 gp), five *+2 arrows* decorated with green flames, a *dagger of venom*, an *immovable rod*, and two *potions of greater healing*. Bracus gifts all this to the characters if they save him, or they can loot it if things go the other way.

#### Getting Away
When the fight is done, the characters can exit through the portal, return to the portal nexus, and leave *Dangerous Business*. If they want to explore *The Maverick* first, that enormous ship is crawling with elite Dran Enterprises operatives (use the **veteran** stat block), all of whom know to kill intruders on sight.

If Bracus is alive, all Dran Enterprises personnel have been magically ordered to allow the characters to leave the Luskan docks unharmed. If such a message is not received, the guards on the boat and the docks react badly to the party's appearance, and the characters must sneak, talk, or fight their way to safety. Once away from the docks, the characters can lie low for as long as necessary, then depart Luskan.

*The Six? Don't waste my time with fables. Yeah, there are people who don't like Acq Inc. People with grudges. People with axes to grind. But they're not some sort of... I don't know, cult or gang or whatever.How am I so sure? Because I've been in this from the beginning. Do you have any idea what I know? What I've seen? The hits I've taken for Acquisitions Incorporated? If there were a cabal of subtle masterminds working the shadows, cunningly plotting the downfall of Acq Inc, they would have definitely recruited me by now.*— Viari
## Conclusion
With their exciting portals-based adventures in Luskan done, the characters attain 5th level! Just as importantly, they've learned that Dran Enterprises isn't the real villain behind the attacks on Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. If the characters spoke to Bracus or obtained the book from the lizardfolk's satchel, they also have a solid lead indicating that Horn Enclave holds the final orrery component. If they failed to talk to Bracus and have not yet deciphered the book, see "Enter Flabbergast" in the next episode to bring them up to speed.

When the characters complete the journey from Luskan back to their headquarters, they find their half-orc majordomo in a great mood.

>>Gilda Duhn is all tusks, grinning from ear to ear. "I just heard word from Head Office! The bosses have been watching how well you run the business, and your mission in Luskan is all anyone is talking about! Our license has been expanded to cover a broader territory around Phandalin! And even better, I've been crunching the profit statements, and I think we're ready to expand this headquarters!"
>>

## Franchise Advancement
As the characters attain 5th level, the franchise attains rank 2! You and the players should all spend some time in the "*Franchise Advancement*" and "*Company Positions*" sections of chapter 2 to read up on the exciting improvements for the franchise, for its headquarters, and for the characters as their company positions yield even more powerful benefits.

#### Franchise Headquarters Upgrades
All the characters' hard work and luck to date is about to pay off in the form of headquarters upgrades! The "*Franchise Advancement*" section in chapter 2 has details of the cosmetic, expansion, transportation, and weapon options available to the characters for their headquarters. The available upgrades can cover literally any features that you and the players decide on, but always keep in mind the ways in which the events and developments of the adventure might drive those upgrades.

For example, the expansion option available to the headquarters might amount to simply digging out more space beneath Tresendar Manor. But it also might arise as a result of the franchise moving its headquarters to the Silent Sound lighthouse—or even claiming both sites as a joint headquarters. That latter option is even easier to set up if the characters' possession of the orrery and its components allows them to channel teleportation magic into their headquarters as their transportation option.

#### Hiring Staff
At rank 2, the franchise gains four additional untrained hirelings and one skilled hireling, allowing the characters to hire new staff to meet their needs. Such hires can be done in-character if the players enjoy those kinds of scenes—and the franchise could even set up a job fair for potential employees at a local market or tavern. If the characters have made any allies or hired NPCs during preceding episodes, those NPCs might be taken on as official staff members at this time. This is also an excellent time to bring in an NPC the characters enjoyed interacting with, making that character an official part of the franchise family.

***Crew.*** In addition to staff, ten crew are hired to help with the franchise. In addition to working on the upkeep of the franchise headquarters, these NPCs might be part of the team necessary to operate a mobile headquarters (sailors for a sailing ship or airship, arcane engineers for a walking statue or teleporting tavern, and so forth).

#### Making Franchise Advancement Rewarding
Advancing a franchise is meant to be a major accomplishment for the players and their characters. This is a moment to celebrate and reward the party's deeds and to help the players get excited about designing and selecting their franchise upgrades. Some players might focus on mechanics, while others enjoy the creativity of dreaming up how a franchise headquarters looks and feels. There is no wrong way to approach the process.

Headquarters customization is deliberately open-ended to allow for creativity. This might create some work for you as the DM, since you adjudicate the characters' customization choices. A good rule of thumb is to allow the players full creative freedom while sticking to the mechanics (however loose) presented by the rules in chapter 2. If the characters want their headquarters to be a giant bouncing rubber ball, let them go for it! In the end, that option can still make use of the general idea and mechanics of a walking statue headquarters, even if the description of the headquarters' appearance and movement is vastly different.

Once the characters are done planning their upgrades, Gilda the majordomo takes over the mundane task of hiring contractors and starting construction. The length of time it takes for upgrades to be completed is up to you, but one to two months is reasonable. During that period, the characters have plenty of opportunity to engage in downtime activities and franchise tasks.

## Franchise Downtime
During the break between episode 4 and episode 5, the characters are likely to be focused on deciding their next move. The urgency of seeking out the final orrery component at Horn Enclave depends on whether the party successfully claimed the two components held by Dran Enterprises, or whether they watched the mind flayer Szorrulax vanish with the components in hand. Moreover, knowing that the Six are behind the attacks on Acquisitions Incorporated, the characters can learn everything Head Office knows about that faction—but what is known about the Six amounts to little more than rumors and their somewhat-trademark-infringing logo. You can tease any of the information from "*Factions and Rivals*" in chapter 3 as you see fit.

Since the characters are now running a rank 2 franchise, they can assign two franchise tasks to be run by staff in addition to any personal downtime activities they wish to engage in. If those downtime activities or franchise tasks involve actively seeking connections to and information about Horn Enclave, that information can be revealed in any number of ways.

All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the "*Franchise Tasks and Downtime*" section in chapter 2.

#### The Road to Horn Enclave
Characters or staff engaging in the research, marketeering, or scrutineering activities can uncover all kinds of connections to the dwarven Clan Horn and its fabled fortress. The characters might connect with customers or allies who know of caravans that make regular runs to the enclave, or who have heard rumors about local nobles or mages who have left relics there to be safeguarded.

The carousing activity can bring the characters into closer contact with merchants or nobles connected to Horn Enclave. One of those is a company called Dhargun Ironworks, who are sending a caravan to the enclave within the next month for the unlikely purpose of celebrating a wedding. *Episode 5* has much more information on the Dhargun wedding—and the unique opportunity it offers for the characters to gain access to the enclave.

You can use the following guidelines to give the characters a quick overview of Horn Enclave. And as they learn about the enclave, they'll also discover its storied and problematic (for them) connections to Acquisitions Incorporated:

- Horn Enclave is a dwarven stronghold run by the wealthy shield dwarves of Clan Horn.
- Lady Kira Horn and Lord Zardak Horn head the clan. Rizwin Horn is their daughter, and the public face of the enclave. Ironbeard is the enclave's head mage.
- The dwarves of Horn Enclave are no friends to Acquisitions Incorporated. During a prior visit to/incursion of/assault against Horn Enclave by Acquisitions Incorporated, a number of regrettable incidents occurred.
- Those incidents may or may not have included impersonation, mendaciousness, and violence.
- Also, there was a major theft from the enclave's vaults.
- And there was a thing about threatening Ironbeard. And sleeping with Rizwin, then stealing Rizwin's jewelry under the pretense of wanting to remember her... it's a long list, actually.

If the characters double down on research, you can share additional specific details from the "Horn Enclave" section of episode 5 if you like. This might include information on residents and guards, gaining access to the hold, the general workings of its vaults, and so forth.

## Continuing the Adventure
The more the characters learn about Horn Enclave, the stronger their understanding that getting inside will be a difficult task for most—and an impossible task for anyone openly connected to Acquisitions Incorporated. Thankfully, Head Office has some assistance it can offer in that regard as the characters plan their incursion!
---
# Episode 5: Hide and Seek
![[080-04-37.png|right|300]]

The characters (now 5th level) know that Horn Enclave is the hiding place of the last unclaimed clockwork component of the *Orrery of the Wanderer*, called the *wheel of stars*. They also know that Horn Enclave is all but impossible to get into. Thankfully, Acquisitions Incorporated has the party's back.

With the help of Acq Inc fixer Flabbergast, the characters make use of a unique ritual that lets them swap bodies with a group of dwarves heading to the enclave for a wedding. This gives the characters access to the vaults, but the deception creates complications as they struggle with the deep secrets of their possessed dwarves and must try to keep the wedding on track.

Accessing the orrery component vault reveals valuable information from the clockwork creatures that guard the vault. But the characters are ultimately chagrined to discover that the component isn't there, with the vault set up as a ruse to distract anyone attempting to rebuild the orrery. Still, the orrery's creator—a wizard named Lottie—wishes to meet anyone savvy enough to have come this far, provided they share her interest in ensuring that the orrery's power is never used.

Traveling in style in a borrowed battle balloon, the characters journey to Lottie's sanctum in the Greypeak Mountains. But en route, the franchise is intercepted by airships belonging to the Six. The characters get their first glimpse of Splugoth the Returned, one of the Six's mysterious members, and the point goblin for the plan to claim the orrery. In fact, the attack is only a distraction, providing cover for an attempt to steal the orrery housing and the components the characters have obtained.

Continuing across the Greypeaks, the characters reach the ruined town of Fortune and the casino resort known as Lottie's Palace. There, they discover that Lottie is a lich whose exclusive retreat holds secrets and deadly threats in equal measure. With no hope of winning a fight against Lottie and her numerous lich allies, the battle must be one of wits as the characters attempt to convince her to help Acquisitions Incorporated, tell the orrery's origin story, and provide the final orrery component.

## Enter Flabbergast
While the characters sought out information on Horn Enclave, word of their investigations reached Head Office. Alternatively, if the characters couldn't figure out the connection between the orrery and the enclave, word of that mystery reaches Head Office instead. Either way, the characters receive an unexpected visitor, offering some unexpected assistance.

>>Standing before you is a tall, smooth-headed male human with a neatly trimmed black beard, dressed in pressed business attire. He pauses from writing in his ledger to look up at you. His eyes narrow as if evaluating you. At his feet is a calico cat wearing a monocle and a horned helmet. The cat is busy licking itself but pauses to look at you. It also narrows its eyes.
>>
>>"I am Flabbergast, gentlepersons," the figure says. "In the employ of Acquisitions Incorporated's Head Office, and at your service." He gestures down to the cat. "This is Mister Snibbly. We need to talk. It's about your mission."
>>

**Flabbergast**, wizard and majordomo to Head Office (see *appendix A*), has been dispatched to assist the characters with the goal of gaining the final orrery component from Horn Enclave. Mister Snibbly has no agenda, beyond making it clear that he thinks the characters leave much to be desired. If the characters haven't yet figured out that the enclave is where the component is stored, Flabbergast can fill in the missing bits of what they know, all the while chiding the characters for missing important clues. If the characters haven't yet heard about the Dhargun Ironworks caravan's imminent trip to Horn Enclave (see "Dhargun Ironworks" below), he can relay that information as well.

Flabbergast can also provide or reinforce the backstory regarding Acquisitions Incorporated's well-known incursion of the enclave. In response to any discussion of that past mission, the wizard sums up the party's position as follows:

>>"As you might well guess, gentlepersons, infiltrating Horn Enclave by traditional means would be difficult at best. And if you were discovered, then your status as agents of Acquisitions Incorporated would place you in grave peril. Though likely not for long." Flabbergast sighs. Mister Snibbly spits up a hairball in disgust. "The dwarves of Clan Horn would kill you immediately, is what I'm saying. As such, Omin Dran has requested that I offer my assistance. Have you ever heard of the *ritual of astral transmogrification*?"
>>

The characters will not have heard of the legendary ritual Flabbergast names, which has long been lost to history. Its magic allows characters to enter a dreamlike state, leaving their bodies safely behind while their souls temporarily possess other bodies. Flabbergast explains that the ritual's creator died long ago, and its components are now unknown. But if the characters can help him determine and track down those components, Flabbergast can provide them the perfect means to infiltrate the dwarven stronghold. By taking possession of some other group with legitimate business in the enclave, the characters can wander its vaults at their leisure without arousing suspicion. Well, maybe just a little suspicion. But it'll all be fine.

#### Seeking the Ritual
You decide what form the ritual's components might take, from ancient verses and arcane inscriptions, to rare herbs and alchemical reagents, to any other obscure bit of magical paraphernalia in between. You also decide how much time and what specific effort is necessary for the characters and Flabbergast to determine and track down those components. This might involve short side quests of your own devising, or having NPCs conveniently turn out to be a source of some components. The Splintfig sisters from episode 2 are good candidates, as is Hoobur Gran'Shoop if the party stayed on good terms with the psychopathic gnome.

If the characters take more downtime to seek out the ritual's components, they might use marketeering to find customers or brokers of magical supplies and rare spell components. The shady business practice activity could alternatively turn up connections to those who dabble in more dangerous and secretive magic.

#### Does Anyone Have a Better Idea?
This episode assumes that the characters make use of Flabbergast's ritual to enter Horn Enclave, but the information presented on the enclave is easily adaptable to other approaches. As such, the players and characters are absolutely free to come up with other methods of seeking the final orrery component. Even though the dwarves of Clan Horn remain furious at Acquisitions Incorporated and the enclave's defenses are formidable, the players should always have the last say regarding the characters' actions.

Workable alternatives include such plans as the characters secreting themselves aboard the Dhargun Ironworks caravan, posing as last-minute wedding guests, or masquerading as others making a vault deposit. They might attempt to convince the guards that their appointment time was somehow overlooked, pay someone off to learn the song of the day that is the password into the enclave, or any other plan they dream up.

If another plan is hatched, Flabbergast successfully seeks out the components for the astral transmogrification ritual by himself, strictly as a backup plan for the characters. He's been ordered to journey to the enclave with the party and watch over the operation, and provides one of the characters with a small stone token bearing the symbol of Acquisitions Incorporated.

If the characters need the ritual performed in an emergency, they can activate the token by speaking the command word "Whippoorwill." Flabbergast then uses a crystal ball to locate them and perform the ritual. By possessing the bodies of dwarf guards and Clan Horn operatives, the characters should be able to successfully defend their own magically slumbering bodies and get them out of the enclave safely. And possessing the token also puts the characters in a position where the ritual might be cast accidentally if they don't use it to enter the enclave, strictly for your amusement.

## Traveling to Horn Enclave
The Dhargun Ironworks caravan bound for Horn Enclave is set to reach the main gates in the morning, then depart again that evening. With the characters able to enter the enclave in the bodies of the caravan's wedding party, they can locate the vault, secure the orrery component, and leave when the caravan departs at the end of the day. Should be easy, right?

With their mobile headquarters, the characters should have a straightforward time traveling from Phandalin to the mountains northeast of Silverymoon. Or if the players are dying for some action, you can use wandering monsters to liven the journey up. Once close enough, the characters can set their franchise down in a safe location away from prying eyes, then approach the wide dirt road leading to Horn Enclave. From the safety of cover alongside the road, Flabbergast casts his ritual when the Dhargun Ironworks caravan is spotted. See "Flabbergast's Ritual." Flabbergast casts the *ritual of astral transmogrification* as the caravan comes to a stop. As the magic takes effect, each character's consciousness departs its normal body and enters that of a named caravan NPC. Go down the list of caravan NPCs in the order presented in the "Wedding Guests" section above, assigning each guest to a random player until each character has an NPC. (If your group has more than seven players, you'll need to come up with additional NPCs and secrets.) Describe the NPCs and their relationships to all the players, but do not divulge any NPC's secret until it is triggered as described in each itinerary section." in the "11:00 AM" section below.

## Dhargun Ironworks
The challenges in this section of the adventure arise from the goals of the caravan members and how they intersect with those of the characters. Once Flabbergast's ritual is activated, each character possesses one of the NPCs in the caravan. However, each NPC has a secret goal that remains dormant until the goal is triggered during a specific scene. When the secret is triggered, the DM tells the player the secret and informs them that their character is compelled to fulfill that secret goal. For maximum entertainment value, wait until the triggering scene to tell the players about any secret goals.

#### The Caravan
The caravan is made up of three horse-drawn carriages and bears sixteen dwarves to Horn Enclave for a wedding that will unite the Dhargun and Thunderwind clans. Both dwarven families are quite different, with the Dharguns favoring commerce and the Thunderwinds dedicated to warfare. But the unlikely love between Gwendolyn Dhargun and Tannus Thunderwind has brought them together.

The reason for holding the wedding at Horn Enclave is that the caravan also bears valuable gifts provided by both families, which will be placed in a vault until Gwendolyn and Tannus complete their honeymoon and decide where they'll spend their lives as a couple. (The pressure from both families to choose one clan over the other is huge.) Gifts include furniture, art pieces, and other large items, along with adamantine bars worth 5,000 gp, a suit of *+1 mithral half plate* inscribed with the insignia of Dhargun Ironworks, and a *belt of dwarvenkind* bearing the insignia of the Thunderwind Clan.

#### Wedding Guests
Each of the guests in the wedding party is a dwarf, including the happy couple, their family members and wedding party attendants, and various retainers to both clans. Except for Rala, each guest uses the NPC stat block noted below with the following racial traits:

- Their speed is 25 feet.
- They have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- They have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage.
- They speak Common and Dwarvish.

You should familiarize yourself with the key NPCs detailed below. Any of the information that isn't secret can be shared with characters when they first possess an NPC through Flabbergast's *ritual of astral transmogrification*.

***Gwendolyn Dhargun.*** Gwendolyn (LG female dwarf **veteran**) is the cherubic overseer of Dhargun Ironworks, having recently taken over from her aging mother, Amara. Gwendolyn is an excellent metallurgist and runs the business with superb aplomb. She worries that her professional success overshadows her betrothed, Tannus, who until recently was a raving barbarian bent only on war. She believes that Tannus has changed. Her goal is to convince him that she believes in him and is proud of the person he has become. Gwendolyn carries no weapons with her for the wedding.

Gwendolyn's secret revolves around wanting to prove that she believes that Tannus has truly changed, but that she still respects his past. During the celebration, she asks Thoman, her family's head of security, to go to the vault and bring out the suit of armor as a gift to her husband.

***Tannus Thunderwind.*** Tannus (CG male dwarf **berserker**) is a reformed barbarian. His only love used to be the battlefield, but that changed when he met Gwendolyn. Everything about her was peaceful, tranquil, and better than him. He has since sworn to give up violence, become a partner to Gwendolyn, and help grow the ironworks. His goal is to convince Gwendolyn's family that he is good enough for her, and that he has given up his violent ways. Tannus carries no weapons with him for the wedding.

Tannus's secret involves wanting to prove himself to Gwendolyn. He must abstain from violence all day long, no matter what happens.

***Rala Dhargun.*** Rala (NG female dwarf spy, to all appearances) is Gwendolyn's cousin, lifelong best friend, and attendant of honor for the wedding ceremony. Having lived a life of adventure herself, she is supportive of Gwendolyn marrying someone different. She stays at Gwendolyn's side, encouraging her and ensuring that she has a wonderful day. Rala carries a shortsword as well as a set of thieves' tools and mason's tools.

Rala's secret is that she isn't actually Rala. The dwarf was recently kidnapped and is currently held by agents of the Zhentarim. This version of Rala is a **doppelganger** on a secret mission to steal the *belt of dwarvenkind*, which the Zhentarim plan to sell to an eager buyer. Rala's plan is to pickpocket the vault key held by Gorat, one of Tannus's attendants. She'll then access the vault while everyone is having drinks in the tavern. One of the gift boxes present at the celebration has her crossbow hidden within.

Rescuing the true Rala might make an interesting side quest for further development, depending on how and if the characters interact with the dwarves in the wedding party.

***Amara Dhargun.*** Amara (NG female dwarf **bandit captain**) is Gwendolyn's mother—a crotchety old dwarf with serious doubts regarding Tannus Thunderwind. However, Amara loves her daughter and is willing to trust her judgment. She carries no weapons at the wedding.

Amara's secret concerns a pledge to ensure that her daughter's marriage goes off without a hitch. If anything gets in the way of a successful ceremony, she plans to cut that thing to pieces with a family heirloom battleaxe that she's hidden inside a gift box present at the celebration. (The battleaxe uses the same statistics as the bandit captain's scimitar attack.)

***Thoman Dhargun.*** Thoman (LN male dwarf **priest**) is head of security for Dhargun Ironworks. He cares little for weddings or love. All that stuff just gets in the way of business and creates security risks. Thoman carries a warhammer that uses the same statistics as the priest's mace attack.

Thoman's secret involves his professional devotion to Amara. To make sure nothing goes wrong with the ceremony that might upset Gwendolyn's mother, he plans on checking the vault while Gwendolyn and Tannus are saying their vows, and must report any disturbances or thefts.

***Gorat Thunderwind.*** Gorat (CN male dwarf **berserker**) is Tannus's cousin and oldest friend, and bears many scars from the battles they've fought together. He loves battle still, and is struggling to understand and support Tannus's change of heart and mind. Gorat carries no weapons for the wedding, but he's resourceful enough to turn anything he grabs into a weapon. Such improvised weapons use the normal berserker attack statistics.

Gorat's secret involves his goal to deliver a toast during the dining hall celebration that will call Tannus to battle, to see once and for all whether his friend has changed. Gorat does not do this out of malice, but out of love. He wants to ensure that his friend is on the proper path.

***Jormun Thunderwind.*** Jormun (NG male dwarf **priest**) is Tannus's father, and will conduct the ceremony to marry his son to Gwendolyn. He carries a warhammer and a shield.

Jormun's secret involves relief that his son has changed his ways. Though he has not confessed this to anyone, he hopes that Tannus can leave his days of battle behind and find love and peace with Gwendolyn. If a battle breaks out, Jormun stands by Tannus or Gwendolyn (whoever is in greater danger).

***Other Guests.*** Nine other dwarves representing both families have come to see the wedding—and to underline the fact that the two families really don't trust one another. The Dharguns see the Thunderwinds as uncouth and violent, while the Thunderwinds see the Dharguns as uppity and boring. None of the guests carry weapons, for the safety of all attending.

#### Character-Building Exercise
If the characters use an alternative plan to gain access to Horn Enclave, they might not play out the NPCs' secret agendas. However, these secrets can still be relevant factors in the episode. While the characters are in Horn Enclave, they will likely interact with members of the wedding party, and might even be invited to join the festivities or ride in the caravan when the group departs. At opportune moments, an NPC might befriend a character and ask them for help with their secret goal. And, of course, if things start going badly at any point, the characters can say "Whippoorwill" into the stone token given to them by Flabbergast to have him perform the ritual—or they might have the ritual cast for them whether they want it or not. See "Ironbeard's Entrance." As the gifts from the families are being placed in the wedding vault, a dwarf wizard with a steel-gray beard appears. Ironbeard (LN male dwarf **mage**) introduces himself and wishes the happy couple well. He then inspects the vault, carefully examining everything with the help of a *glass jeweler's eye* (a magic device that functions as a *gem of seeing*)." in the "11:15 AM" section of the wedding itinerary for more information.

## Horn Enclave
Horn Enclave is a legendary dwarven stronghold run by Clan Horn, wealthy shield dwarves whose estates and holds spread across the Spine of the World mountains. The enclave's business is the leasing of secure vaults to wealthy patrons, with nigh-impregnable defenses designed to keep each vault's contents safe from thieves. Map 5.1 shows the layout of Horn Enclave.

![[081-map-5-1-dm.jpg|right|300]]

#### Within the Enclave
Horn Enclave is a fully inhabited living space, workshop, and stronghold.

***Residents.*** The enclave is home to more than one hundred dwarves, with nearly half of those working as guards. Clan Horn is led by Lady Kira Horn and Lord Zardak Horn. Zardak is getting on in years, nearly blind, and increasingly defers to Lady Kira's decisions. Rizwin Horn, their daughter, is a capable diplomat and negotiator who greets all guests to the enclave. The head mage for the enclave is a dwarf known as Ironbeard, responsible for security and charged with inspecting all deposits to the vaults. (The stat blocks to be used for these NPCs are found when they first appear in the adventure.)

***Layout.*** The Horn Enclave map shows the layout of the fortress and its described locations. Guest quarters are located in the northwest, near the tavern. The vaults are located to the northeast. The chambers of the enclave's lady and lord are located to the east, beyond the great halls. To the south stand residences, forges, and the enclave's temple.

***Entrance.*** Entrance to the hold is through a long passage secured by four sets of portcullises and by fortified doors. The doors are opened by iron golems, who do so only when they hear a set of bagpipes play the song of the day that is the passphrase into the enclave. A dwarf outside the main doors plays this song each time an approved caravan arrives. The doors lead to the Hall of War, a large room containing a terrifying construct—the aptly named slaughterstone eviscerator—ready to defend the enclave in times of need. See the "11:15 AM" section of the wedding itinerary for more information.

***Guards.*** Scores of dwarf **guards** can be called upon to defend the enclave, with most occupying the barracks adjoining the vaults. Patrols are infrequent due to the overall security level of the enclave, but a group of four guards is dispatched if an attempt to pick a vault's locks is detected. If the guards find trouble they can't handle, they summon more guards and raise a general alarm, summoning Ironbeard, Rizwin, Lady Kira, or Lord Zardak. In true emergencies, Ironbeard activates the slaughterstone eviscerator in the Hall of War (see the "11:15 AM" section of the wedding itinerary).

***Alarm Response.*** If an alarm is raised, the dwarves cordon off sections of the enclave by accessing levers in hidden chambers, each of which drops a portcullis along a major hallway. The lever chamber north of the Hall of War controls the main gates and the two portcullises north of the Hall of War. The lever chamber east of the forge controls the portcullis south of the Hall of War. The lever chamber west of the war room controls two portcullises east of the dwarven residences. Other defenses are noted in relevant sections of the episode.

***Vaults.*** Details of the famed vaults of Horn Enclave are provided in the "11:15 AM" section of the wedding itinerary.

## Wedding Itinerary
The Wedding Itinerary table provides an overview of the day's events, which are part of your recipe for hilarity and disaster. At the appointed times, guests move from one location to another and begin a specific event. If an NPC has a secret, it activates during the appropriate event. Take the player of an NPC aside and inform them of their secret goal, and explain that the importance of the goal to the body they inhabit means that they are compelled to try to accomplish this goal. Players can share their secret goal with other individual players once they learn it, as long as sharing it would not contradict that goal. For example, the player running Gwendolyn should not share their goal with the player running Tannus, because the whole point is for Gwendolyn to surprise her new husband with the gift. Likewise, the player running Rala does not share her goal with anyone having an interest in what's in the vaults.

In any free time between events, or by sneaking away from events, the characters can try to realize their primary goal of finding the final orrery component. The time of each event in the itinerary is known to all members of the caravan, so the characters can plan when to perform their heist. Of course, the secret goals of the wedding guests might impact those plans.

Unlike a typical dungeon infiltration, the layout of the enclave is not as important as the itinerary. Players are not expected to turn this into a dungeon crawl, if only because Horn Enclave is teeming with guards and other dwarves. Any wedding guests seen in private chambers or away from the events of the wedding itinerary are given a warning the first time, then questioned more carefully and searched each time thereafter. Evidence of theft or other lawbreaking could result in a guest being supervised by a guard until the caravan departs.

If the dwarves of Horn Enclave somehow find out that the characters are members of Acquisitions Incorporated, permanent incarceration or execution are among the best possible outcomes. Ideally, the players coming up with hilarious ways to escape will allow them to prevent such fates. Even if the characters have not used Flabbergast's ritual, it should be clear to them that paying attention to the wedding's schedule makes it easier to find times when they can more easily reach the vaults.

#### 11:00 AM—Arrival
The Dhargun Ironworks caravan rolls up the mountain and approaches the gates to Horn Enclave. Excitement runs high among the dwarf wedding guests, both for the coming events and for their first trip to the storied enclave. Read or paraphrase the following:

>>On a gray morning with cloudy skies, three horse-drawn carriages roll up the mountain, heavy with cargo. Dwarves can be seen steering the carriages and peering out of windows, and their voices carry a sense of excitement and wonder as they approach Horn Enclave.
>>
>>The stronghold is indeed awe-inspiring. A massive arched stone entrance—a marvelous work of art in and of itself—leads into the mountain. Four sets of heavy iron portcullises stand fast before the caravan's approach, with a set of stone doors taller than a giant set behind them to mark the interior entrance to the enclave. The caravan stops and waits as a dwarf with bagpipes steps forward before the portcullis gates.
>>

***Flabbergast's Ritual.*** Flabbergast casts the *ritual of astral transmogrification* as the caravan comes to a stop. As the magic takes effect, each character's consciousness departs its normal body and enters that of a named caravan NPC. Go down the list of caravan NPCs in the order presented in the "Wedding Guests" section above, assigning each guest to a random player until each character has an NPC. (If your group has more than seven players, you'll need to come up with additional NPCs and secrets.) Describe the NPCs and their relationships to all the players, but do not divulge any NPC's secret until it is triggered as described in each itinerary section.

While the ritual is in play, characters have full control of their host bodies and enjoy all capabilities of their new forms, including weapon and skill proficiencies, vision, languages, and spellcasting. They can also apply proficiency bonuses or expertise for skills their characters have, albeit using the ability scores of their new form. However, any spellcasting characters discover that they have left their original magic in their original brains.

Let each player refer to the entry in the *Monster Manual* for their NPC's stat block, so that they can familiarize themselves with their new capabilities. The ritual's magic lasts until nightfall, which is after the caravan's departure. It can be ended before that time for any character with a *dispel magic* spell (DC 20).

![[082-04-39.png|right|300]]

***Bagpipe-Activated Doors.*** Once the dwarf with bagpipes has identified the caravan properly, they play the song of the day. (This can be whatever tune you think has appropriate comedic value.) As the bagpipes fill the cavernous entranceway with sound, the portcullises rise. The enormous stone doors are pulled open by two **iron golems**, allowing entrance to the Hall of War.

The carriages remain outside the Hall of War, and dwarves of Clan Horn approach to help with the cargo and lead the guests to the vault. If the characters have a different plan, they can execute it now. The party can contact Flabbergast to have him perform the ritual at any time.

***Secrets.*** No secrets specifically activate at this time. However, several NPCs have secrets triggered by events rather than a specific time. For example, you would provide Tannus's player with the groom's secret if at any time Tannus is about to swing a weapon to damage a creature. (You can decide whether to allow Tannus to fight to protect himself or others, but should encourage the player running him to think about creative nonattack ways to influence the fight.) Provide Amara her secret if she sees her daughter Gwendolyn in danger. Provide Jormun his secret if he sees Gwendolyn or Tannus in danger.

> ##### Secret? What Secret?
>Though most players should embrace the mayhem and roleplaying opportunity created by their NPCs' goals, some might have trouble reconciling these goals with their desire to accomplish their franchise mission. Downplaying a secret goal can feel like the best path to securing the orrery component and winning, while some players might blurt out their secret goal with the excuse that their character would try to do so.
>
>Encourage players to embrace the roles and enjoy the concept of momentarily placing their NPC's secret goal as a top priority. Players might be more willing to take this on if you let them know that the scenario takes their conflicting priorities into account. Indeed, these scenes place an emphasis on situational comedy over numerical challenge. So players should think of the role as their challenge—can they succeed at playing someone they're not?
>

#### 11:15 AM—Hall of War and the Vaults
The caravan is met in the Hall of War by Rizwin Horn, daughter of Lady Kira and Lord Zardak. Rizwin is a capable diplomat and negotiator, and she expects the wedding guests and caravan servants to stick to the areas indicated by the itinerary. She despises Acquisitions Incorporated, and brings the full force of the enclave down upon the characters if she learns they are members of a franchise.

>>Beyond the double doors is an enormous rectangular hall, easily fifty feet wide and over a hundred feet long, with smaller double doors set into the other three walls. Every surface of the walls, floor, and ceiling is exquisitely carved with runes and bas reliefs depicting dwarves at war. Grand pillars shaped like stone dwarves hold up the ceiling.
>>
>>The floor is intricately carved and appears to be inset with stone tiles that can shift, lift, and rotate. Five dwarves are in the process of moving tiles around, as if shaping a massive mosaic. Not far from the dwarves is a large metallic construct with a terrifying number of appendages ending in blades and saws. It is thankfully unmoving.
>>
>>A female dwarf with sharp eyes and deep red hair tied in braids calls out a greeting as she approaches the caravan. "Welcome, guests and friends of Clan Dhargun and Clan Thunderwind! Horn Enclave is at your disposal for the wonderful occasion of your wedding!"
>>

Rizwin (LG female dwarf **knight**) personally greets and congratulates Gwendolyn and Tannus, inquiring about their trip and wishing them a wonderful day. She reviews the itinerary with all members of the group (see the Wedding Itinerary table) and makes sure everyone understands that they are not free to wander the enclave at will.

If asked about the construct, Rizwin calls it the slaughterstone eviscerator, and explains that it's there to protect Horn Enclave. "Moradin help anyone who crosses us," she says, laughing. The construct can be activated by Ironbeard or Rizwin, or by anyone who accesses the control panel in its belly and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If the check fails by 5 or more, the construct animates and attacks.

The slaughterstone eviscerator is a deadly wild card, which might serve as a frightening distraction or be woven into the characters' outrageous plans. It uses the stat block of a **stone golem**, but its slam attack is a blade attack that deals slashing damage.

When all other business is done, Rizwin addresses the wedding party one last time.

>>"Your vault awaits, ready for the gifts each family has brought for the wedding. As instructed, we will safeguard these gifts until Gwendolyn and Tannus are ready to receive them. For today only, keys will be given to Thoman Dhargun and Gorat Thunderwind, for the storage of any additional gifts during the celebration. After that time, Thoman Dhargun will retain one key and Horn Enclave shall retain the other."
>>
>>Rizwin then grows suddenly stern. "Please remember that Horn Enclave is a secure location. As we are responsible for our other clients, you are expected to remain at all times with your group in the areas indicated for your itinerary. Now, let us proceed together to the vaults."
>>

Rizwin leads the wedding party through the double doors to the north, through the corridor leading past the barracks where dwarf guards can be seen lounging and training, and to the vaults. The double vault indicated with an "X" on the map is the vault for the wedding gifts, the largest and most valuable of which are deposited at this time. (Characters with a solid background in company history might recall that this is the same vault that the core members of Acquisitions Incorporated once robbed.)

***Vault Doors and Keys.*** Each vault door is covered in iron bands, lined with lead to prevent scrying, is air- and watertight, and features layers of locks that make opening a vault without its keys nearly impossible. Two keys are required to open a vault door, with one typically held by the enclave and a second by the owner of the vault's contents. When both keys have been turned in multiple locks, the door opens. While the wedding is in progress, Gorat and Thoman each have one of the keys for the wedding vault.

The vault holding the orrery component has one of its keys held by Ironbeard. The other key is with Lottie at the end of this episode. See "Orrery Vault" below for more information.

***Picking the Locks.*** Three consecutive successful DC 20 Dexterity checks using thieves' tools are required to open an outer vault door. Failing any check requires restarting the process. After three overall failures, the door to the vault gives off a loud ringing noise and four guards come to investigate. The DC is reduced to 10 if the character has one of the vault's keys. Any character who has read the vault records (found in Ironbeard's quarters or Lady Kira and Lord Zardak's quarters) has advantage on checks to open a vault door.

***Vault Walls.*** Despite how strong the doors and magic of the vaults are, the walls between adjacent vaults are relatively thin. Dealing 40 bludgeoning or force damage to an inner wall creates a hole wide enough for a character to enter another vault. (What kind of attention doing so attracts is left to your determination.) Other means of entering might be possible, including some of the scrolls carried by **Two Dry Cloaks** the tabaxi (see "11:30 AM").

***Double Vaults.*** Some vaults are set up as two rooms, with the magically locked door of the second room also requiring a password to be spoken before the door can be opened. The wedding vault is a double vault, with the password set as seen at "Ironbeard's Entrance" below.

***Orrery Vault.*** The single vault holding the orrery component is immediately northeast of the vault marked "X." This vault is further detailed in the "Orrery Vault" section below. Discovering which vault holds the component is an important bit of business that the characters must accomplish at some point during the day. Rizwin knows the location, as does Ironbeard, Lady Kira, and Lord Zardak. The contents of all vaults are also noted in the vault records, a copy of which is kept in Ironbeard's quarters, with another copy in Lady Kira and Lord Zardak's quarters. A character who has studied the records has advantage on checks to open any vault door.

***Ironbeard's Entrance.*** As the gifts from the families are being placed in the wedding vault, a dwarf wizard with a steel-gray beard appears. Ironbeard (LN male dwarf **mage**) introduces himself and wishes the happy couple well. He then inspects the vault, carefully examining everything with the help of a *glass jeweler's eye* (a magic device that functions as a *gem of seeing*).

When he's convinced that all is well, Ironbeard asks the couple to set the password they wish to use for the inner door. For the duration of the wedding, the inner door will remain open so that Gorat and Thoman can access the vaults. But Ironbeard explains that afterward, even someone with both keys cannot open the inner vault unless Gwendolyn or Tannus speaks the password.

If the characters are running Gwendolyn and Tannus, they can set the password as they wish. If the characters are not possessing the wedding guests but are present in the vault, things can get potentially interesting.

***Plan B.*** If the players are not running the wedding party at this point—and if they're up for even more of a roleplaying and improvisational challenge—Gwendolyn and Tannus look to one another and whisper, "Whippoorwill." They laughingly explain that a whippoorwill flew overhead when they first met. Ask any characters within earshot (as they will be if they're acting as tag-along wedding guests) to make Wisdom (Perception) checks, with the highest check overhearing the password. That character gets a moment's warning of what's coming.

In an amazing coincidence, "Whippoorwill" is the phrase Flabbergast set on the stone token to trigger casting the ritual. If the players have come up with a savvy approach to entering the enclave that didn't make use of the ritual, you don't need to use this option. But if your group will have fun with it, Flabbergast hears the word spoken and casts the ritual, so that the characters' bodies slip into a state of slumber as they possess the bodies of the wedding party. What approach the possessed dwarves—now run by the players—might take to explain the characters' sudden unconsciousness, then safely hide those slumbering bodies away, is up to the players and you.

***Secrets.*** No secrets specifically activate at this time. However, Thoman and Gorat now each have a key to the vault that allows them to act on their secrets later.

#### 11:30 AM—The Tavern
Rizwin leads the caravan party back through the barracks, then north, west, and north again to the tavern.

>>Great tree trunks have been cut in half to form a series of long tables in this drinking hall. The northern wall behind the bar is formed entirely of kegs of ale, all of them tapped. Busy servers pour frothy mugs and serve them to the multitude of dwarves already here. As Rizwin steps into the tavern, she claps her hands once and several dwarves quickly clear two central tables for the wedding party and guests. Tall mugs of amber beer are served, while platters loaded with skewers of roasted meat and root vegetables are brought to the table. Drinks and food are on the house!
>>

For the next two hours, the caravan party enjoys ale and food, toasts Gwendolyn and Tannus, and swaps tall tales. Guests can visit other tables to meet Clan Horn dwarves, so the characters can move around without drawing attention to themselves. Ironbeard and Rizwin are both here, and the characters can speak to them to try to pick up clues as to the location of the orrery component. (Attempts by any characters to hit on Rizwin are made with disadvantage.)

Many of the Clan Horn dwarves have been drinking heavily. Targeting the heavier drinkers can grant advantage on checks made to pry information from them. While in the tavern, the dwarves are relaxed and won't react negatively to a failed Charisma check. However, continued failures result in guards being called. Those guards issue a warning against bothering folk not in the wedding party, and might eventually search or incarcerate any individual who continues to cause trouble.

***Tabaxi Merchant.*** Sticking out like a sore thumb is a lone merchant at the end of one of the long tables. **Two Dry Cloaks** (N female tabaxi) wears a bandolier of magic wands and watches over a number of small chests beneath her table. She passes herself off as an accomplished mage and merchant, though she's actually a career rogue—and a member of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. After looting the treasury of a religious order she was formerly affiliated with, **Two Dry Cloaks** has come to Horn Enclave to deposit her ill-gained goods and lay low for a while. Whether her franchise is known to the characters (and whether her recent theft was done for the franchise or as a solo job) is left up to you. Naturally, **Two Dry Cloaks** has made sure that the dwarves of Clan Horn know nothing of her company affiliations.

To use **Two Dry Cloaks** as an NPC, give her the stat block of a **spy** with these changes:

- She has the following attack option: **Claws**. *Melee Weapon Attack*: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 2 (1d4) slashing damage.
- She has the following racial trait: **Feline Agility**. When the tabaxi moves on its turn in combat, it can double its speed until the end of the turn. Once it uses this ability, the tabaxi can't use it again until it moves 0 feet on one of its turns.
- She has the iconic hoardsperson feature (see "*Iconic Faction Features*" in *appendix B*).

(More information on the tabaxi can be found in *Volo's Guide to Monsters*.)

**Two Dry Cloaks** is a wild card, placed in the adventure to help the characters gain information. She can share details about the vaults in general, where vault records are stored, and the like. Intimidation and trickery work on her well enough, but a friendly attitude wins her over to the characters more strongly. If the characters stay on her good side, she might become a valuable ally and resource.

![[083-04-40.png|right|300]]

**Two Dry Cloaks**'s wands pulse with magical light, though only two of them have actual useful properties. The first is a *wand of binding* that glows purple. The second wand blinks with blue and green light and is a *failed experiment* at combining a *wand of fireballs* and a *wand of lightning*. It functions as a *wand of fireballs*, except it has only two charges per day and casts either a green-flamed *fireball* or a blue *lightning bolt* at random. **Two Dry Cloaks** also carries a scroll tube with three *spell scrolls*: *prayer of healing*, *silence*, and *stone shape*.

***Lady and Lord Horn.*** Lady Kira Horn and Lord Zardak Horn (NG female and male dwarf **veterans**) arrive halfway through lunch. Zardak is half-blind and periodically confers with his wife to make sure he is speaking to the correct person. Both are pleased to have a wedding in their halls, and they engage in small talk to ask polite questions of their guests. Many of those questions involve the business operations of Dhargun Ironworks and the military history of Clan Thunderwind. Thankfully, neither Kira nor Zardak appear to mind if a character isn't too sure about the answer.

At a time of your choosing, Lord Zardak appears to notice something odd about one of the characters or the body they inhabit, but this ends up just being his bad eyesight. Fifteen minutes after they arrive, the two take their leave.

***Rala's Secret.*** Rala's secret triggers during this scene, and the character inside Rala's body is momentarily overwhelmed by the doppelganger's personality. Stealing Gorat's key requires a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by Gorat's Wisdom (Perception) check. Gorat has disadvantage on the check from the distraction of the festivities—or, if controlled by a character, he could decide to just hand over the key. Rala must then decide whether to also try to steal Thoman's key (if he isn't possessed by a character inspired to give it to her). Having two keys makes opening the door effortless, but the security chief is a cagey and suspicious sort.

Once she has at least one key, a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check allows Rala to exit the tavern without being drawn back into the general merriment by one of the guests. She must then succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check to make it past the barracks without notice and reach the vaults. Rala could instead do away with stealth and attempt to talk her way past the guards, given that she's a known member of the wedding party and has the vault key in her possession. Combat is a poor option, however. Each barracks room holds ten dwarves (use the **guard** stat block, with the modifications noted for dwarf members of the wedding party).

#### 1:30 PM—Guest Quarters
Rizwin directs the guests out of the tavern and to the guest quarters. Here they can relax, take a nap (and sober up as necessary) before changing into the formal wedding attire waiting for them in their rooms.

This time off is a perfect opportunity to figure out where the orrery component is stored and make a move on the vault. Rala's disappearance might complicate things, but she can reappear just as everyone is entering their chambers. Depending on how the player handles the scene, Rala might not admit to having already been in the wedding vault (and likely has the *belt of dwarvenkind* hidden upon her person). It takes a number of successful ability checks (possibly group checks) to leave the guest quarters, cross the barracks, and reach the vault. Use the same DCs and options provided for Rala in the previous itinerary section as guidelines.

Once the characters reach the vaults, they must decide how to proceed. See the "11:15 AM" section for information on breaching the vaults and the "Orrery Vault" section below for information on what is found within that vault.

***Secrets.*** No secrets specifically activate at this time.

#### 4:00 PM—Temple
Dressed in their finest, the members of the Dhargun and Thunderwind families head to the temple. Rizwin leads them south through the Hall of War and east past dwarven residences. Ironbeard exits his quarters to join them, revealing the location of that area if the characters haven't sussed it out already. The temple is beautifully carved to depict the Mordinsamman (the dwarven pantheon), including fine statues of Moradin, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Berronar Truesilver, and Haela Brightaxe.

After initial pleasantries, Rizwin indicates to Jormun that he may climb the steps to the dais to begin the ceremony. At this time, Thoman's secret triggers.

***Thoman's Secret.*** As the ceremony begins, Thoman gets an odd feeling as he recalls hearing Amara worrying about the vault and what might happen to the still-fractious relationship between the families if anything were stolen from it. To appease Amara, he wants to check the vault and report to her if all is not well. This requires borrowing Gorat's key, which Gorat lends willingly (whether run by a player or not). The mercurial Thunderwind has no concerns that a Dhargun lackey would dare do anything to jeopardize the wedding. However, if Gorat's key is still missing after being stolen by Rala, the doppelganger will need to quickly arrange to have it found to avoid a sudden catastrophe.

Thoman won't return in time to see the vows, so he plans to meet everyone at the celebration in the dining hall. He feels compelled only to report missing items (such as the *belt of dwarvenkind* or anything taken by the characters). If under a player's control, he need not mention anything else amiss (such as a hole in the wall) as long as the vault's contents are intact.

***The Ceremony.*** Jormun would normally provide a fiery ceremony on the virtues of the Mordinsamman, with an emphasis on Clangeddin's battle prowess. If a character is controlling him, that character can be put on the spot to describe the ceremony and how the dwarves reconcile the different elements of the pantheon (in particular, the balance between gods of war such as Clangeddin and those of marriage and home, such as Berronar Truesilver). Clan Dhargun is pleased by an emphasis on the hearth, while Clan Thunderwind appreciates an emphasis on battle.

The hall then grows quiet. Look to the characters inhabiting the wedding couple, letting them know everyone is staring at them. If they don't guess what's happening, one of the guests leans forward and reminds the couple to join Jormun on the altar. The guests have a good laugh at the couple forgetting the ceremony details, chalking it all up to the pair being nervous.

Once at the altar, Jormun asks for the couple's vows. This is a fun opportunity to see if the two players want to improvise vows, since they were supposed to have memorized them. After the vows, Jormun pronounces them a married couple and the hall erupts in cheers.

After allowing everyone to receive the couple, Rizwin thanks Jormun for the wonderful ceremony (even if it left much to be desired) and leads everyone back the way they came and north to the dining hall. Characters could try to make their way to the vault at this time, though anyone doing so runs into Thoman, and are likely to be noticed arriving late to the celebration.

#### 4:30 PM—Dining Hall
The dining hall has been festooned with colored streamers and lit with huge braziers. Long tables in the center include platters of food and seats for guests, while a table nearby holds gifts from attendees (including a few from Clan Horn). Servers bring ale and spirits, and the mood is festive. Ironbeard, Rizwin, and even **Two Dry Cloaks** are all here, though Lady Kira and Lord Zardak are not.

***Gorat's Secret.*** Gorat's secret is the first to activate in this section. His goal is to come up with a toast that calls Tannus to battle, to see once and for all whether his friend has changed. Encourage the player whose character possesses Gorat to make up a toast that urges Tannus to tell a story of his prowess at war. Secretly, Gorat hopes that Tannus turns down the challenge. How Tannus responds could determine whether his clan has an easier or harder time calming down once chaos erupts. A good battle tale leaves them eager to fight!

As the challenge is being resolved, Thoman returns from checking the vault and heads to Amara to report his findings.

***Gwendolyn's Secret.*** When Thoman arrives, Gwendolyn asks him to borrow Gorat's key (if he doesn't still have it), then go to the vault and bring the suit of armor to the celebration. Depending on what Thoman has found, it's possible that he's in the middle of telling Amara about missing items.

> ##### No Trouble Here
>If the players were lucky, clever, showed amazing restraint, or somehow failed to have their characters access the vaults at all, it's possible that Thoman didn't find anything missing. If he reports to Amara that all is well, the celebration is uneventful and the ending could feel a bit flat. If you want to shake things up a bit, you could activate the tabaxi merchant. In this option, **Two Dry Cloaks** is a thief who hits the vault before the first or second time Thoman checks it. This act achieves the desired chaos, and should give the characters opportunities to notice **Two Dry Cloaks**. Perhaps she looks guilty, has some cuts and bruises, or has a bulge under her shirt from concealed treasure. Once the tabaxi is identified as the culprit—and especially if the characters out her as an Acquisitions Incorporated franchisee—the chaos dies down.

***Amara's Secret.*** If an item has been stolen, Amara's secret triggers and she races to get her battleaxe from the gift table. She then begins searching for the culprit and screaming about thieves and saboteurs. The items in the vault are meant to bind the fractious families, and if any are missing (presumably taken back by one family or the other), the wedding might be considered invalid.

***Missing Items.*** News of any trouble at the vault spreads like wildfire, and members of both families begin accusing each other. Chaos erupts! Thankfully, the guards of Horn Enclave know that any dwarven wedding comes with a certain amount of chaos, and are keen to let the two families sort their problems out before getting involved. As such, this scene is a great opportunity for the characters to explore their NPCs' personalities and backstories as things get heated. By focusing on the humor of potential conflicts, you can avoid having the guards rush in as a first response.

The characters have many options here. They could use the opportunity to escape (or head to the orrery vault if they haven't already). More than likely, they'll be inside NPC bodies and need to defuse the situation so they can reach the caravan departure phase in one piece.

The characters could try to save the marriage, perhaps resolving the crime by pinning it on one person (or convincing Rala to take the fall). Let the players develop a plan and add reactions from the crowd (including Clan Horn NPCs) as needed. Accusations and turmoil prompt Ironbeard and several guards to inspect the wedding vault, which could lead to the discovery of any breach into the orrery vault.

***Tannus's and Jormun's Secrets.*** If violence breaks out between the families (or between Horn Enclave and any possible thieves), Tannus finds that he really wants to avoid being violent. This might be his last chance to prove his love to Gwendolyn! Jormun's secret causes him to protect the married couple at all costs. His actions could help bring the warring families together by example.

> ##### Innocent Bystanders
>If the characters have already accessed the orrery vault, they could decide they don't care what happens and sit on the sidelines to watch. In this case, take the events directly to them so that they're encouraged to react. An effective technique is to couple an NPC approaching them with a surge of emotions within one of the controlled NPCs. For example, Ironbeard could call for everyone to be searched, just as Amara (and the character controlling her) begins to contemplate what might befall her daughter if the families decide the wedding is invalid.
>

#### 6:00 PM—Departure
Once the chaos dies down, the guests can go back to merrymaking until the evening comes. If the chaos doesn't die down, the dwarves of Clan Horn eventually order the warring Dhargun and Thunderwind families to leave the enclave and sort out their problems on their own.

Guests are led—or driven at spear point—through the Hall of War and out the main doors to their waiting carriages. (Characters who triggered the ritual within the enclave will need to juggle getting both their dwarven hosts and their original bodies out.) Rizwin, Ironbeard, Lady Kira, and Lord Zardak all come to say appropriate goodbyes. Ironbeard takes Gorat's key, then returns to the dining hall with several guards to take any last gifts from the celebration to the vault. By the time he does so, the caravan has safely departed.

The characters can say any final words. If they stole any treasure, they can attempt to drop it over the side of the caravan for later retrieval. As the sun dips below the horizon, Flabbergast's ritual ends and the characters return to their normal bodies. Continue with the section "Battle in the Skies" as they travel toward Lottie's domain.

## Orrery Vault
At some point during the wedding itinerary, the characters attempt to breach the vault containing the *wheel of stars*. See the "11 AM" section for information on the wedding vault, the vault doors, and other defenses. When the characters enter the orrery vault, read:

>>Statues of human-sized brass dragons stand at the center of the vault, their heads pointed at a globe of light hovering in the air between them. A circular clockwork device floats within the light, recognizable even at a distance as one of the components of the *Orrery of the Wanderer*."
>>

![[084-04-41.png|right|300]]

#### Clockwork Dragons
Each of the dragon statues in this area is a **clockwork dragon** (see *appendix B*), and is indistinguishable from a metal statue until it moves. If the characters are possessing the bodies of the dwarf wedding guests, two clockwork dragons are on guard here. If the characters are themselves, they face five of the creatures.

The clockwork dragons take no action until a character moves toward the globe of light, at which point, they swivel their heads toward the nearest characters and speak (see below). If any character steps within 5 feet of the globe of light, the clockwork dragons attack all creatures in the room, though they continue to respond to characters engaging them in conversation even during the fight. (If a character attempts to seize the component, see "The Missing Component," below.)

Properly engaging the constructs gives the characters a chance to learn about the orrery's creator and where she can be found. As part of the conversation, the clockwork creatures start off by asking the characters the following questions:

- "Who are you, and what are your ideals?" (Ideals related to running a business or earning a fortune appear to please the clockwork creatures.)
- "Who do you serve?" (The clockwork creatures show no reaction to any response.)
- "Why have you come to Lottie's vault?" (This can lead the characters to ask about Lottie, who the clockwork creatures know as the wizard who created the orrery.)
- If any character mentions the orrery, the clockwork creatures ask, "Why do you seek the orrery?" (Responses that suggest the franchise is trying to stop some great evil can result in the clockwork creatures sharing Lottie's location.)
- "What would disappoint you the most right now?" (If a character mentions the need to recover the final orrery component, a clockwork creature answers, "Prepare to be disappointed.")
- "What is the best way to make money?" (The clockwork creatures are particularly pleased if a risky endeavor, including running a franchise, is mentioned.)

If fully and properly engaged, the clockwork creatures share the following information:

- The creatures state that they will harm only those who have come to the vault with the intent of misusing the orrery (which they assume includes anyone trying to steal the component). However, they are not automatically friendly to those claiming other intent.
- The creatures were created to guard this vault and its contents.
- Lottie, a powerful wizard and clockmaker, created them. (The clockwork dragons do not identify Lottie as a lich.)
- Lottie also created the orrery, but later scattered it and its components. The creatures do not know why Lottie did this.
- "It is best not to cross Lottie. She destroys all who dare rise against her."
- If the creatures believe the characters' cause is just (or at least coincidentally would prevent a great evil), they can share that Lottie lives in a cave near a destroyed town called Fortune, located amid hills to the east of the Greypeak Mountains, not far from the desert of Anauroch.
- The town of Fortune was built recently and quickly destroyed by Lottie for daring to challenge her authority.
- "Lottie would not like our telling you too much about her. She's very powerful, is a master of clockwork, and has lots of style."

If the characters earn the clockwork dragons' complete trust, they are allowed to reach for the orrery component where it floats within the light. But the dragons warn them that they might not get what they want.

#### The Missing Component
The final orrery component, the *wheel of stars*, appears to float within the globe of light. However, the characters are ultimately unsuccessful in their attempt to claim the component, because the orrery's creator is using the vaults of Horn Enclave as a clever ruse.

A **lich** named Lottie created the orrery—and then scattered its pieces far and wide when she realized how dangerously powerful it was. Wanting to dissuade adventurers and others from trying to collect the pieces, she made it known that one piece was sealed in the vaults of Horn Enclave. In truth, that piece has been with Lottie the whole time, even as the false story kept those seeking the *wheel of stars* away from her.

The orrery component cannot be moved or manipulated by magic. When any creature attempts to physically seize the component, it reveals itself as an illusion. As the illusion dissolves, it is replaced by a small (real) leather bag floating within the globe of light, on which is written "Congratulations!" Within the bag are thirty strange coins that appear to be gold, but which are actually copper covered in gold foil and stamped with the letter L. (These are tokens for Lottie's casino; see "Lottie's Palace" later in this section.) Also in the bag is a note bearing a message in a regal script.

>>*Congratulations on the determination that got you this far in search of the *wheel of stars*! And sorry that your reward has been denied you. The wheel has been with me always, and even as this ruse is ended, I promise it shall never be given over to those who would use the power of the orrery for woe. If that be you, feel free to face me—and know your doom. But if perchance you have come here seeking the orrery so as to destroy it*...*well, then, you have piqued my interest*.
>>
>>*My name is Lottie. Find me if you can*.
>>

#### Loose Ends
If the characters kill the clockwork dragons without talking to them, the constructs are able to speak even after being smashed. This can allow the characters to question them, and vice versa. If the characters completely miss all the clues in this section, additional downtime or asking Head Office for help can provide details regarding someone named Lottie with a penchant for creating clockwork creatures.

Though the characters are unable to claim the final orrery component at this time, they now know where it and its creator can be found. Once the caravan departs and they return to their bodies, they can plan their next move.

## Going in Style
The journey south and east to the Greypeak Mountains covers miles of treacherous terrain, and time is of the essence. As such, the trip presents an opportunity for the characters to play with one of Acquisitions Incorporated's most sought-after assets—a battle balloon.

The characters can report back the outcome of their Horn Enclave mission to Flabbergast or Omin Dran, or Head Office makes contact with them if they report back to Gilda Duhn first. Knowing the importance of tracking Lottie down, Omin authorizes the loan of the battle balloon at once, with the vehicle arriving at the characters' location within a few days—accompanied by a voluminous contract and an extensive list of penalties to be paid if anything should happen to it.

The primary focus of the agreement is to clarify the incomprehensibly high rental cost (waived by Omin for this mission), and to emphasize that the vehicle remains the property of Acquisitions Incorporated. The lengthy process of signing, countersigning, witnessing, and signing again is followed by the characters providing samples of fingernail and hair clippings. In case of the destruction of the balloon and all aboard, the company reserves the right to resurrect characters as indentured servants to work off the loss.

The crew that delivered the battle balloon remain with the ship, though the characters are firmly in charge and have plenty to do on board, as seen in the next section. *Appendix C* provides combat statistics for the battle balloon (because you know that's coming), so assume that a suitable number of crew are available to operate the balloon and its weapons alongside the characters.

> ##### Sticking with What They've Got
>If the characters' mobile headquarters is something cool enough that they would rather use it than the borrowed battle balloon to travel to the Greypeaks, that's fine. Just rework the encounters in the "Riders on the Storm" and "Battle in the Skies" sections appropriately. For example, a giant walking robot can be toppled by rough storm winds or damaged by lightning and hail. The area around a teleporting headquarters such as a tavern that lets characters travel to other taverns can become the site of the Six's airship attack, and so forth.
>

## Riders on the Storm
As the characters travel to the Greypeaks, they encounter unusual weather, followed by an ambush by the Six. How well the characters negotiate the weather determines certain elements of the ambush.

#### Nasty Weather

>>The sun hides behind clouds that increasingly darken as you head toward the Greypeak Mountains—and, hopefully, the wizard who created the orrery. A steady rain begins to fall, and the wind begins to howl. A crash of thunder is followed by forks of lightning. Soon, sheets of rain are falling while lightning flashes on every side. The lightning forms concentrated pockets, creating a maze of sorts.
>>

A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check confirms that the storm is not natural. It might have been manipulated by a powerful spell, an artifact, or proximity to a portal to an elemental plane. But whatever its origin, it is obvious to the characters that they must maneuver the battle balloon through the storm, and retreat is not an option.

Have the characters select a role on the battle balloon from one of the following:

**Captain**, providing leadership to the other characters and crew

**Pilot**, charting a safe course

**Weapon master**, directing the crew operating the vehicle's weapons in case enemies appear

**Lookout**, watching for dangers

**Mechanic**, leading the crew battening down the hatches and making repairs

Additional characters in a really large party can use the Help action to aid one of the characters taking a role above, or can come up with their own strategy (such as casting an appropriate spell). Any roles not filled by characters can be filled by crew members, who have a +3 bonus to any ability checks made in this section.

Riding out the storm takes place as three distinct events that play out over a few minutes.

#### Event 1
The storm has become deadly, with pockets of lightning flaring all around the battle balloon. Have the characters make the following ability checks, with the outcome determine as noted . Spells and clever ideas can be substituted for any of the suggested actions if you deem them effective.

***Weapon Master.*** No enemies appear during this event. However, the weapon master can use the Help action to assist the lookout or the captain.

***Lookout.*** Have the lookout attempt a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check to call out the many pockets of lightning ahead.

***Captain.*** The members of the crew are on edge. Have the captain make a DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check to steady the crew and prepare them for the pilot's commands.

***Pilot.*** Have the pilot attempt a DC 13 Dexterity check to chart a course through the lightning. Proficiency with flying vehicles can be used for this check. The check is made with disadvantage if the lookout failed their check, but is made with advantage if the crew has been steadied by the captain. If the check succeeds, the battle balloon avoids any lightning. If the check fails, each character takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage. The battle balloon takes the same amount of damage to its hull and catches fire (see below). In addition, the crew is shaken, imposing disadvantage on any checks by the captain in the next event.

***Mechanic.*** If the ship is on fire, the mechanic must make a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to reach the fires and put them out with the crew's aid. On a success, the fire is extinguished. On a failure, the fire deals another 9 (2d8) fire damage to the battle balloon's hull before being extinguished by the driving rains.

If there is no fire, the mechanic can lock down stray lines to give the pilot advantage on their next check.

#### Event 2

>>The storm dies down as the battle balloon sails away from the pockets of thunder and lightning. That's when fist-sized hail begins to drop out of the sky. As you search for a path out of this storm, a rock of ice the size of a giant's boulder misses the balloon by a few feet!
>>

***Lookout.*** Have the lookout attempt a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot areas where the storm thins and warn the pilot when boulder-sized hail would strike the battle balloon.

***Captain.*** The captain must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check to steady the crew and prepare them for the pilot's commands. This check is made with disadvantage if the pilot failed their check in the previous event.

***Pilot.*** Have the pilot attempt two DC 14 Dexterity checks to chart a course through the hailstorm. Proficiency with flying vehicles can be used for these checks. A check is made with disadvantage if the lookout failed their check this event, but is made with advantage if the crew has been successfully steadied by the captain this event or if there was no fire in the previous event. If both checks succeed, the pilot manages to avoid the hail and heroically steers the battle balloon to safety. If one check succeeds, each character takes 5 (1d10) cold damage from the hail and the crew is shaken for the next event. If both checks fail, two NPC crew members are killed, the captain has disadvantage on their check in the next event, and a massive boulder of ice heads for the battle balloon.

***Weapon Master.*** If the pilot failed both checks, the weapon master must attempt to shoot the ice boulder with one of the battle balloon's weapons. If the attack hits, the boulder is destroyed. If the attack misses, the boulder strikes the battle balloon, killing a crew member and dealing 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage and 5 (1d10) cold damage to the battle balloon's hull. If the pilot succeeded at one check, the weapon master is free to help the mechanic.

***Mechanic.*** Regardless of any other damage taken so far, the battle balloon's rigging has been torn by the hail. The mechanic can attempt a DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check or a Wisdom check making use of proficiency with flying vehicles to repair the damage. On a success, the battle balloon operates normally. On a failure, the pilot has disadvantage on their next check.

#### Event 3

>>Though the winds still howl and buffet the battle balloon, the lightning and hail falls away behind you. The clouds turn from purple-black to a light gray. That's when you see the funnel cloud moving toward you. And... is that a face forming within it?
>>

The storm has attracted a massive sentient funnel cloud that threatens to consume the battle balloon!

***Lookout.*** Have the lookout attempt a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to track the funnel cloud's movement and call out large debris.

***Captain.*** Have the captain make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check to steady the crew and prepare them for the pilot's commands. This check is made with disadvantage if the pilot failed both checks in the previous event.

***Weapon Master.*** The weapon master can attempt to shoot the huge storm in the face with one of the battle balloon's weapons. If the attack hits AC 16, the storm momentarily wavers. This can be used to counteract one failed check earlier in this event, by either steadying the crew or giving the lookout time to shout new instructions to the pilot.

***Pilot.*** Have the pilot attempt a DC 14 Dexterity check to dart away from the funnel cloud, making use of proficiency with flying vehicles. This check is made with disadvantage if the lookout failed their check this event (or if the mechanic failed their check in the previous event), but is made with advantage if the crew has been steadied during this event. With a success, the battle balloon evades the storm without taking damage. If the check fails, the battle balloon's hull takes 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage.

***Mechanic.*** The battle balloon rigging is being torn apart by the strong winds. The character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check or a Wisdom check making use of proficiency with flying vehicles to prevent further damage. If the check fails, the battle balloon's hull takes 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage.

The sentient cloud moves along as the storm passes. But there's no time to relax...

## Battle in the Skies!
Immediately after the last "Riders on the Storm" event ends, the characters come under attack by an airship controlled by the Six. If anyone needs healing, you could let the characters each have a round to cast a spell or drink a potion. But otherwise, the action is continuous.

>>Dropping out from behind a dark cloud is an airship held aloft by a large balloon—emblazoned with the sigil of the Six! A crew of hobgoblins and goblins can be seen swarming the deck, and a ballista and three harpoon guns are trained on your vessel. To arms!
>>

If the battle balloon took more than 20 damage, the chaos of the storm has distracted the characters and crew. In that event, all creatures on the characters' battle balloon are surprised by the airship sent by the Six to engage the franchise—and to steal the franchise's orrery components. Use the battle balloon stat block from *appendix C* for the Six's airship, but substitute the following Blowout Ballista attack for the Green Flame Arbalester attack:

*Ranged Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 ft. of it), one target. *Hit*: 16 (3d10) piercing damage and 22 (4d10) fire damage.

The airship's crew is made up of a female **hobgoblin captain** named Garla, six **hobgoblins**, six **goblins**, six **smoke mephits**, and a **hippogriff** (serving as the captain's mount). All these creatures are recent mercenary hires, so none of them have the iconic affiliate of the Six features. They employ the following strategy, hoping to distract the characters while they steal the orrery housing and as many of its components as they can.

#### Round 1
The Six's airship begins 100 feet away from the characters' battle balloon. Roll initiative for the airship and all the creatures on it, but the creatures intentionally take no actions this turn. The Six's airship keeps more than 60 feet away from the characters' battle balloon to allow it to fire all weapons. In this round, the Six operatives don't reel in the lines of their airship's harpoon guns, content to attack at range and entice the characters to make counterattacks against the enemy ship. The hippogriff, the smoke mephits, and half the goblins and hobgoblins are below decks to avoid damage. One of the mephits activates a *wand of magic detection*.

#### Round 2
If any harpoons have hit, the Six's crew begin to reel them in using the airship's Harpoon Haul, pulling the characters' battle balloon closer. In this and later rounds, if the Six's airship and the characters' battle balloon are within 5 feet of each other, half the goblins and all the hobgoblins except the captain board the characters' vessel, hoping to draw the characters into one-on-one combat.

#### Round 3
A second airship drops out of the clouds! This ship has no visible crew and no weapons, but it does have an outrageously sized needle attached to its prow. This second airship does not attack or have any active crew. It simply deploys the needle in the hope of puncturing the characters' battle balloon.

If the characters are using their own mobile headquarters, adjust the mechanism as appropriate to that headquarters, making use of some obvious vulnerability. The mechanism's purpose should be immediately obvious. For example, if the headquarters is a walking statue, the mechanism might be an arm that deploys a huge bear trap.

It takes 2 rounds for the needle to reach the characters' battle balloon. When the needle makes contact, it automatically deals sufficient damage to the balloon to create a slow-leaking puncture. This doesn't cause a sudden crash, but the battle balloon begins to descend slowly to the ground. To prevent this from happening, the characters must destroy the needle (AC 10, 75 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage).

Hoping that the characters are suitably distracted, all four mephits slip overboard and fly around and under the characters' battle balloon, hoping to pinpoint the location of any strong magic on board.

#### Round 4 and Beyond
Any remaining goblins emerge to board the battle balloon and attack the characters. The hobgoblin captain rides her hippogriff into battle. The mephits assume that the strongest magic they detect on the battle balloon is the orrery components the characters have collected, and they undertake any combination of attacks and ability checks you determine to claim those components. One mephit flies away with each component claimed, attempting to blind characters trying to follow it with its Cinder Breath.

The hobgoblins and goblins protect the mephits, even as they obey orders to take out characters holding the orrery components. If all the orrery components held by the characters are claimed, any surviving Six operatives flee the battle.

***Splugoth's Retreat.*** The airship with the needle disengages once the needle has been successfully deployed or destroyed. As it departs the scene, the characters spot a smirking goblin with one pale eye looking out at them through a porthole. **Splugoth the Returned** laughs at or curses the characters, as appropriate to the success or failure of his agents in retrieving the characters' orrery components. In a worst-case scenario in which the characters come after him, Splugoth points his airship at the ground, where it crashes in 2 rounds. During that time, he drinks a *potion of invisibility* and jumps overboard wearing a *ring of feather falling*. The characters get another chance at Splugoth in *episode 6*.

#### Mopping Up
If the characters capture the Six's airship, they find it is in a sorry state. It will not fly much longer, and is beyond repair. By the same token, the characters need to repair their borrowed battle balloon. A few hours' work (including salvaging parts from the Six's airship if applicable) makes the Acq Inc battle balloon airworthy again for the continued journey.

Any Six operatives captured during the fight are keen to earn their freedom by telling everything they know. They were hired by Splugoth the Returned—a goblin who hates Acquisitions Incorporated, and who claims to have returned from the dead. Splugoth hired the hobgoblins and goblins to attack the characters as a distraction, but they know nothing else about the Six's plans.

## (Mis)Fortune
Once the battle is over, the characters continue the voyage to the Greypeak Mountains, following up on the information gained in the Horn Enclave vault. The mysterious wizard, Lottie, is said to have destroyed the town of Fortune, and the characters are about to find out just what kind of destruction took place.

#### Fortune's End

>>On the eighth day of travel, you finally locate the town of Fortune, hidden in the foothills of the Greypeak Mountains near the desert of Anauroch. Though dusk is upon you, even in the fading light, you can see that the town was never very big to begin with—and that it is completely destroyed. Most of its buildings are empty shells and piles of wreckage. Looming beyond the town is a large, dark cavern. A narrow river winds down from the mountain and along one side of the town. Its water is a strange phosphorescent green color.
>>

The characters can wander around the town as desired, but the only thing that greets them is the wind blowing through empty streets.

***Investigating the Town.*** A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals infrequent tracks belonging to different humanoid creatures. Some travel alone, while others go in small groups. A check of 17 or higher also reveals dog prints, though some of those prints have more claws per foot than an ordinary dog.

A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check made to search the ruins determines that many of the houses are not actually destroyed—they were simply in the process of being built and never finished. The construction was hurried and cheap, which caused the structures' rapid deterioration. None of the houses hold valuables, but a few reveal makeshift shelters within, along with piles of old clothing and bedding. One of the shelters is built from large wooden signs upon which is written: "There's a Fortune to Be Made in Fortune!", "Choose Fortune and Win!", and "Tokens! Lowest Prices!"

The grass, trees, and other plants in the area appear normal. Birds and rodents can be seen in typical numbers. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check turns up no signs of physical damage consistent with a battle that could have leveled the town.

***Questionable River.*** The water of the river is thick and slow moving, glows a phosphorescent green, and smells awful. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check indicates that the water has been contaminated by magic and has unusual side effects. Anyone drinking the water gains the poisoned condition for 1 hour and has a 50 percent chance to spontaneously grow an extra head. The extra head can speak, see, and hear, but provides no mechanical benefits. It shrinks away to nothing after 1 hour.

#### Gambling Fever
After the characters have had time to look around, or if they make for the cavern straight away, read:

>>A murmur of voices slowly builds within the wrecked buildings. A stocky humanoid with gray skin and a white beard suddenly stumbles forth, swaying from one side to the other as if intoxicated. It stares at you, points a finger, and yells, "Tokens!" Three more humanoids emerge from the buildings, yelling, "Tokens!" Two of them control dogs on leashes—though each of those dogs has two heads.
>>

***Creatures.*** These four **duergar** start as Medium creatures. In the first 2 rounds of combat, each uses the Enlarge action after pulling out a bottle filled with phosphorescent green liquid and drinking it. (The liquid appears to trigger the duergar's sudden growth and battle prowess, but they drink only to firm up their resolve. See "Development" below.) The duergar are too inebriated to turn invisible. Because night is falling, their Sunlight Sensitivity does not hinder them.

The two **death dogs** quickly pull away from their masters and attack. Each drips green liquid from its jaws and fights until defeated.

As they fight, the duergar continually shout out, "Tokens!" in an angry tone. They can be convinced to calm down or surrender if they are shown and promised the tokens the characters received in Horn Enclave, but they otherwise don't respond to any attempts at conversation.

***Development.*** The duergar are quite mad, having been poisoned by the stream and stricken with gambling fever in Lottie's Palace. (See the next section for more information.) Their clothing and armor is filthy, and they carry only their weapons and one extra bottle of fermented river water. The glowing green liquid has no benefit if imbibed. Rather, any humanoid drinking from a bottle suffers as if they had drunk from the river (see above) and gains a killer hangover that imposes one level of exhaustion when the effect wears off.

#### Almost Here!
When the characters have fought the duergar and determined that there's nothing of import in Fortune, they can make their way toward the cavern beyond the town.

>>The cavern looms more than twenty feet wide and tall, opening up to a dark tunnel that winds its way beneath the foothills. A strange smell hangs on the air, reminiscent of oil and ozone.
>>

A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to search around the cavern entrance detects a pressure plate running wall to wall under the dirt floor. If the check is 17 or higher, it also notes a rectangular object hanging from the ceiling fifty feet farther down the tunnel. This "trap" can be disabled with a DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

Stepping on the pressure plate or failing to disable it causes an audible click and the sound of whirring gears. The rectangular object ahead reveals itself to be a large metal sign that is suddenly outlined in bright pink light, and which bears the words "Welcome! You are Almost Here!" shining brightly. If the sign is not activated, it can be read by any creature within 10 feet of it.

Farther down the twisting tunnel, a second pressure plate activates another sign that spells out "Tokens Available!" in brilliant green. Not far from the sign is a bridge leading over the glowing green river where it bisects the tunnel. Beyond the bridge, a third pressure plate lights up a sign reading "Loosest Slots In Faerûn!"

When the characters round a last corner beyond the third sign, read:

>>The darkness of the tunnel suddenly gives way to light. Tiny glowing globes, many of them blinking, flare to life along the walls and ceiling ahead. Hanging from the tunnel roof is an enormous sign, around which more globes of light chase each other, and on which are lit up the words "Lottie's Palace." Wide steps at the end of the tunnel lead up to a set of open double doors.
>>

There are no dangers outside the palace, beyond exposure to too much flashing light.

## Lottie's Palace
The creator of the *Orrery of the Wanderer*, Lottie is a **lich** and a master of clockwork magic. Her palace is not a typical lich's lair, however, instead taking the form of a swanky casino. As a functional gambling den, public places within Lottie's Palace are safe. Dangerous creatures guard only the restricted areas, including the machinery room and access to Lottie's meeting hall and private chamber.

The characters' arrival at Lottie's Palace coincides with a liches' retreat, wherein Lottie gathers with some of her lich friends to do lich stuff. The characters need to poke around to find their way to Lottie, and can learn useful information with which to present their case before her while they do. In the end, their goal is to learn the last of the orrery's secrets, and to claim the final orrery component from her.

Map 5.2 shows the layout of Lottie's Palace.

![[085-map-5-2-dm.jpg|right|300]]

#### 1. Gambling Den

>>As you pass through the doors, you enter a world of opulence. Glass chandeliers fill a huge open chamber with brilliant light. The floors are carpeted, the walls decorated with scrollwork and painted with images of golden coins bearing the letter L. Dark wooden beams span the vast ceiling, which glitters with thousands of tiny gems.
>>
>>The center of the area holds a sunken gambling pit that is packed with people, sitting in leather-upholstered chairs around tables covered in green velvet. To one side of the hall is a stage where three harpists play, surrounded by a lounge with comfortable chairs and small tables. Beyond that is the bar, and a door presumably leading to a kitchen. A sign to your right indicates the "Powder Room," while another to your left indicates "Tokens." To the far left is a fortified iron door sealed with a large lock. The center of the far wall features another set of double doors.
>>
>>The clientele here all look a lot like the duergar you saw in the town of Fortune. All are gambling in a frenzy, arguing with one another over tokens and swearing that the next game will be the big one. Most of them are drinking heavily.
>>
>>As you take it all in, a skeleton wearing a red uniform with a high collar and a crisp-looking hat approaches you.
>>

***Skeleton Staff.*** The staff of Lottie's Palace are all skeletons with the power of magical speech. The skeleton that approaches the characters greets them in Common, suggests they get some tokens at the cashier, and presents everyone with a tray of drinks. These are complimentary beverages, loaded with rum and fruit juice. They taste delicious, but any character who imbibes four or more drinks gains the poisoned condition for 1 hour, or until the character has a meal at the lounge.

A total of twenty **skeletons** work the floor, acting as dealers, bartenders, wait staff, and entertainment. Many are dwarf-sized (former duergar). The characters can fight the skeletons if they wish, but any altercation darkens Lottie's mood when the characters finally meet her.

Each skeleton uses the normal stat block with these changes:

- It speaks Common, though its responses are programmed.
- A successful DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check notes a small clockwork device attached to the inside of a skeleton's skull that lights up when it speaks.

None of the skeletons are in a position to set up meetings with Lottie. The characters need to figure out how to get to her on their own.

***Gambling Tables.*** All manner of games can be played at Lottie's Palace, including Three-Dragon Ante, dice, Dragonchess, roulette, blackjack, and a cutthroat roleplaying game called Papers & Paychecks. A character can play any game for a cost of 3 tokens (available from the cashier). You can use any combination of checks and roleplaying you like to represent a character's attempts to gamble, but each game should involve at least three checks of DC 12 or higher. An Intelligence (History) or Wisdom (Perception) check might allow a character to suss out the rules of a game or analyze the opposition, while an Intelligence (Investigation) or Charisma (Deception) check can represent careful play or cagey bluffing. The DC of any checks made to gamble increases by 1 for each drink a character consumes.

If a character fails all the checks for a game, they lose their 3 tokens and owe another 3. If the character fails more than half their checks, they lose their 3 tokens and owe 1 token. If they succeed on all checks, they keep their tokens and gain 2 tokens. This is a great way to lose money, but if a character beats the odds and wins more than three times in a row, the dealer for the game declares that it needs to go on its dinner break (despite being a skeleton).

***Slot Machines.*** One side of the gambling pit features banks of strange clockwork machines, each with a large red lever and a slot for tokens. These machines promise great fun, surrounded by colorful lights and amazing sounds. They also drain an average of 3 tokens for every minute of play.

***Gamblers.*** The inebriated patrons are too focused on their gambling to talk to any characters who aren't also in the game. A character who gambles can strike up a conversation at the table, learning three pieces of information for each game they play, chosen from the following revelations:

- Lottie's Palace has been in operation for over ten years. Before the casino was built, the cavern it was carved out of was home to a clan of duergar.
- When Lottie arrived, she offered the duergar jobs building her lair and minting tokens. When the casino was complete, Lottie fired her duergar work force but offered each of them a starter set of tokens as a severance package. The duergar took up gambling and drinking.
- Lottie employs only skeletons to work her palace, many of which were once duergar.
- Some of the duergar decided to start up a town next to the casino and sell tokens at lower cost. They took on construction loans and named their town Fortune.
- After a lot of hard work, customers of the casino began to come to Fortune to get tokens. Lottie lowered her prices in response. Fortune quickly became unable to pay its debts, and the town was abandoned.
- Lottie is not only a powerful wizard—she's a **lich**.
- Lottie loves clockwork. She has crafted many amazing machines, including the clockwork machine room that powers the casino.
- The machine room behind the fortified metal door controls all the clockwork devices in the casino, including the locked double doors that lead to Lottie.

***Treasure.*** The tiny gems embedded into the ceiling are valuable if collected. With 1 minute of uninterrupted work, a character can collect 30 gp worth of gems, to a total of 3,000 gp for the entire area. The chances of the characters being able to work uninterrupted are left to your determination.

#### 2. Cashier
A skeleton in a slinky dress behind the cashier window offers tokens for use at the tables. Each token costs 5 gp. The cashier also suggests purchasing "super lucky tokens," which function identically to normal tokens for the low, low cost of 10 gp each. The L-stamped tokens are made of copper covered with a thin layer of gold, as the characters saw with the tokens found in Horn Enclave.

The cashier accepts any form of valuables as payment (excluding IOUs), which are taken to a huge chest on the far side of the room. Any nonliving matter placed into the chest is teleported to secret vaults located in a distant land.

#### 3. Club Lounge

>>This club lounge is clearly the place to hang out. A sign on the wall says so. Huge fish tanks feature brightly colored fish and an octopus. Soft leather chairs provide a great place to sober up or to enjoy a delicious drink at the bar.
>>

***Bartender.*** The skeleton bartender uses clockwork devices to shake rum drinks, peel fruit, blend fruit juices, and create souvenir flattened tokens (at a cost of 3 tokens). A door behind the bar leads to the kitchen. Characters who sit in the lounge are shown a menu whose only item is "Delicious Meals" for 3 tokens.

The bartender can be bribed (6 tokens) to let characters into the kitchen. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a brass key hanging around the bartender's neck. This opens the door to the machine room (area 5). It's possible to steal the key with a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, or to sweet talk the bartender into "lending" it with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check.

***Lounging Duergar.*** A few duergar are in the lounge, taking a break from gambling and watching the three harpist skeletons on the stage. Chatting up these duergar can provide information as in the gambling hall, at a rate of 1 token per piece of information.

#### 4. Kitchen
Strange clockwork devices prepare food here, all of them slicing, dicing, stirring, mixing, and cleaning in a frenzy. Any character watching the process notes that the fare looks particularly unhealthy, featuring questionable meats, past-their-prime vegetables, and copious amounts of lard. Skeletons come and go to pick up food and drop off dishes. They ignore any characters who don't get in the way.

The door leading north into Lottie's domain is not locked. Lottie assumes that anyone coming this way is a staff member on legitimate business, or is looking to die.

![[086-04-43.png|right|300]]

#### 5. Machine Room
The clockwork machinery in this area generates power for the casino and controls all the other clockwork in the place. The heavy iron door is set with a large lock and a dangerous trap, which sprays anyone who tries to pick the lock with a potent contact poison. The trap can be detected with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) check and disarmed with a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check or Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If the lock is picked without disabling the trap, the character picking it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap resets automatically.

The bartender sometimes accesses this area to adjust power levels and has the key (see area 3). Using the key doesn't bypass the trap (it doesn't need to, as skeletons are immune to poison damage), but grants advantage on the saving throw when the trap is triggered.

This encounter setup assumes that the characters come here before encountering Lottie in area 8. If they've already been to the boardroom and met the lich, adjust the setup so that the **clockwork behir** attacks at once.

When the door is opened, read the following:

>>The walls of this room are covered in conduits and glowing panels, many of which leak green fluid that flows toward a grated drain on the floor. In the center of the room stands a large glass globe on a stone pedestal. A brilliant ball of light pulses within the globe, which roils with dark energy bearing a disturbing resemblance to a map of the world.
>>
>>Coiled around the globe is a long, serpentine creature that resembles a cross between a centipede and a crocodile—and which is made entirely of clockwork. It begins to move, but of more immediate notice is the translucent illusion of a lich in an evening gown lounging on a couch at the far side of the room. She wears an eyepatch and strokes a contented-looking dog as she speaks.
>>
>>"So, you thought to enter my palace and rob me, did you? Let's make it interesting, then. See if you can convince me to spare you before my clockwork pet destroys you all!" The lich laughs as the clockwork creature lunges toward you.
>>

***Creature.*** The **clockwork behir** uses the **behir** stat block with these changes:

- It is a construct.
- It has immunity to poison and psychic damage.
- It has immunity to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned conditions, and to exhaustion.

The **clockwork behir** does its best to destroy the characters, and continues fighting even after Lottie's illusion departs (see below).

Any character fighting the **clockwork behir** can see that the complex arrangement of its workings gives it a unique vulnerability. Any character within 5 feet of the construct can use an action to attempt a DC 14 Dexterity check using jeweler's tools or thieves' tools. On a success, the behir takes 15 bludgeoning damage as it components start to grind, and it is no longer able to recharge its lightning breath.

***Illusory Lottie.*** Lottie, her couch, and her dog are all a projected illusion. The lich nonetheless behaves like a classic villain, and is keen to reveal secrets during the battle if the characters try to explain themselves or do a deal with her. She is generally forthright in her answers (because she's proud of her brilliance and expects the characters to die), revealing any of the following information:

- Lottie created the orrery and its components, but she quickly grew to regret having done so, since the artifact could destroy the world if used improperly.
- When she realized how dangerous the orrery was, Lottie scattered its pieces and left the message in Horn Enclave that brought the characters here.
- She is aware that the orrery's components have been coming together, and that all the missing components and the orrery housing have now been found.
- She knows that the Six wants the orrery. That organization has bargained with terrible powers, which have instructed them in how to use the orrery and its components to open a portal to the Far Realm.
- If the portal is opened, the world will likely be destroyed. A shame, really, because Faerûn is such a profitable place.
- Even if the Six don't have all the orrery components, they'll be able to start their ritual given enough time, tapping into the power of the Far Realm from somewhere in the material world.
- Lottie would totally love to save the world, but she's in the middle of a retreat and completely busy. It's a lot of work keeping all these liches happy.

When the characters have learned all you want them to (or if they start to get the upper hand against the **clockwork behir**), Lottie ends the conversation by saying, "Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I have an appointment. I must go. Have fun dying!" Her illusion then fades.

***Wreaking Havoc.*** Talking to Lottie and not getting killed is the major point of this area. But characters who defeat the behir can remove the panels to access the clockwork machinery here. With a little experimentation, characters can deactivate any of the machinery in the casino, including the locks on the double doors into area 6. At your determination, tearing down the panels and attacking the clockwork behind them can have the same effect.

#### 6. Swimming Pool
The double doors to this huge chamber are covered in clockwork that functions as a lock. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check using jeweler's tools or thieves' tools unlocks the door. The characters can also open the doors from the machine room, or can use the kitchen to access this area. The skeleton staff in the front areas of the casino assume that anyone entering Lottie's private domain is either invited or is soon to be dead, and pay no mind to characters breaking in.

>>The floor of this room is covered in red tiles surrounding a large swimming pool, the bottom of which glitters with thousands of gems. Fountains around the room spray water into the air that hangs as a fine mist.
>>

Unlocked double doors across from the pool lead out to a hallway, while smaller doors lead to Lottie's office and to a changing room stocked with swim suits sized for every type of humanoid creature.

***Creatures.*** A **water elemental** and a **water weird** lurk in the pool. If any creature enters the room and doesn't throw a token into one of the fountains within 1 round, the creatures attack. The water elemental enjoys taking grappled creatures into the pool so that the water weird can play with them.

***Treasure.*** Flecks of gemstone embedded into the bottom of the pool are valuable if collected. With 1 minute of uninterrupted work, a character can collect 10 gp worth of gems, to a total of 1,000 gp for the entire pool.

#### 7. Office
Lottie's books are here—both those she likes to read and her financial records for the gambling hall. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check made to look through the account books reveals that several liches have invested in Lottie's business. If the check is 18 or higher, it becomes clear that Lottie keeps two sets of records—one that she discloses to her investors showing lower profits, and one she keeps to herself with the true profits. If used carefully, this information could let the characters blackmail the lich.

This area can also contain other information of your choosing about the Six or the *Orrery of the Wanderer*. If the characters have missed out on any key revelations up to now, or are having trouble with certain plot points, you can clear them up here and set the stage for a final question-and-answer session in the boardroom.

#### 8. Boardroom

>>Large clockwork double doors open by themselves as you approach, revealing a luxurious room decorated with fine art, rich carpets, several leather couches, and a boardroom table. Crystal balls sitting on pedestals around the room flicker and glow, and a huge fish tank swarms with unusual creatures. Some of them are even alive.
>>
>>Nine liches occupy the room, either lounging around or arguing at the table. All wear leisure suits or sun dresses, including one sitting comfortably with a dog in her lap. All appear surprised to see you.
>>

This area is Lottie's public and personal space, with a private bedroom adjoining the swanky boardroom. Eight of the nine **liches** are here on an annual retreat, taking a break from the various exploitative and profitable enterprises they run back home. Lottie is the ninth lich. This year was her turn to host, and she's regretted every minute of it so far. It's a lot of pressure dealing with these high-powered undead.

![[087-04-44.png|right|300]]

***Negotiating with the Liches.*** Lottie (surprised that the characters survived her **clockwork behir** if they went that way before coming here) wants to disintegrate the characters immediately and says so. However, two liches lounging on couches are bored to the point of seeking any distraction, and they urge Lottie to let the characters speak. Allow the characters to explain why they have come, and to plead the case for receiving the information they need and the last orrery component. You can ask for Charisma (Persuasion) checks to carry the conversation, or let good roleplaying rule.

If the characters haven't encountered the illusory Lottie in area 5, the revelations in that section can be moved here, revealed by Lottie or the other liches. Some of the other liches have heard rumors of the Six's plots, and that the Six have seemingly bargained with terrible powers to learn how to use the orrery components to open a portal to the Far Realm. The commercial interests of these liches means that all understand how destroying the world is bad for business, so the Six must be stopped.

***The Orrery.*** If the characters convince Lottie that their goals are to end the orrery's threat and save the world, she shares any information regarding the artifact that the characters don't already know. She then provides them with the last orrery component, called the *wheel of stars*. Lottie underscores the importance of the characters stopping the Six and preventing that group from opening a portal to the Far Realm. The means by which they do so are entirely up to them. But whatever the outcome of the battle with the Six, Lottie insists that the orrery must be broken up and never used again—and sets a very real threat of dark destruction on the characters if they fail to permanently disable the relic.

***Franchise Opportunity.*** The bored liches' thirst for entertainment might inspire them to ask the characters about what they do—and about Acquisitions Incorporated. Like Lottie, all these undead are focused on the limitless commercial aspects of immortal evil, and might be talked into partnerships with the franchise. The potential for such deals (and the potential risks in dealing with such powerful entities) is left to your imagination.

#### Taking Leave of Lottie
Depending on how their dealings with the liches go (and whether they did any damage to Lottie's Palace while getting to her), the characters can spend a few hours hanging out with the undead. Any prospective business dealings can be lined up, after which the liches order one last round of drinks, then kick the characters out of Lottie's Palace.

## Conclusion
With the events of this episode complete, the characters attain 6th level! Leaving Lottie's Palace behind, they can return safely to their borrowed battle balloon or mobile headquarters, ready to try to figure out where the Six might be conducting their ritual—and how to stop it.

## Franchise Downtime
Much of the break between episode 5 and 6 will be focused on determining the location of the Six's ritual site. The key clue to doing so is knowing that the ritual needs to be undertaken in a location where the planar boundaries are already thin, and where an existing planar portal is likely already in operation. Still, though the end of the world might be nigh, on the off chance that the characters are successful in stopping the Six's plans, they'll have bills to pay.

All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the "*Franchise Tasks and Downtime*" section in chapter 2.

![[088-04-45.png|right|300]]

#### Locating the Ritual Site
As the endgame approaches, the time the characters have spent with the orrery and its component pieces can grant the necessary insight to build a detector that can sense portals or planar disturbances. A portalometer, if you will. The research or scrutineering activities can help the characters uncover the necessary information or tools, while the crafting a magic item activity can cover the construction of the portalometer.

The details of the portalometer are left to the imaginations of the players (including coming up with a better name if they like). The detector might take the form of a magical receptacle allowing one or more orrery components to function as a compass, a divination window tapping into planar disruptions to show brief glimpses of possible locations, or any other device channeling suitable magic.

If you really want to dig deep, you could experiment with the idea that the orrery's power gives it a kind of consciousness (or you could even make it a sentient magic item, as detailed in *chapter 7* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.) In that scenario, the orrery's consciousness might be what the portalometer taps into. Or the orrery components possessed by the Six might begin to call to the components held by the characters, as the artifact seeks to be made whole once more.

The time necessary to locate the ritual site is left to your determination. If the characters are anxious to cut to the chase, you can have a successfully created portalometer lead them straight to the site. In a pinch, you could even say that any orrery components the characters still possess become attuned to the ritual as Splugoth prepares it, allowing the characters to triangulate the ritual site's location. For more build up, you can set up a search involving side treks, which might cover the length and breadth of the Sword Coast as the characters make use of their mobile franchise headquarters.

These side trek missions might tie in to improving the magic of the portalometer and involving tracking down lore or components. Or the characters could discover several possible locations for the Six's ritual, then investigate and eliminate false leads before finding the real site. One such side trek is detailed in "The Moon Glade" in *episode 6*, and you can add similar events as you wish.

#### Seeking the Six
Any number of downtime and franchise activities—from research to schmoozing to shady business practices—can be used by characters seeking to learn more about the ritual or how best to take the fight to the Six. For any tasks in which the outcome includes a complication due to a rival, the Six could be attempting to undermine the characters' franchise to eliminate their threat.

#### Business as Usual
Even as the characters are working on locating the ritual site, they might use the explore territory franchise activity to interact with local customers and allies to strengthen the franchise. A group of merchants might want to sell branded gear manufactured by the liches the characters met at Lottie's, creating additional business opportunities or allowing the characters to follow up on previous negotiations with the liches.

#### Franchise Restructuring
Having recently interacted with several powerful organizations—including Lottie's lich alliance, the Six, and Dran Enterprises—the characters might be bursting with ideas for fine-tuning their franchise and headquarters before the final showdown. This might involve organizational restructuring, headquarters modifications, upgraded magic, and other activities meant to grant the franchise an edge in the coming fight.

#### Meet and Greet
Engaging in shady business practices or outright crime during downtime might result in more than financial reward for the characters. With a suitable degree of success, such activities can bring the characters into contact with agents of the Six. Likewise, the characters might use the cover of criminal activity to infiltrate or expose the Six, or they could use carousing or other social activities to contact an ally or operative of the organization.

Any such interactions should automatically create complications to be resolved, with those complications revealing useful information concerning the Six's plots, the ritual site's possible location, and the defenses around the site.

## Continuing the Adventure
If the characters communicate with Head Office at any point during their downtime, it should be made clear that Acquisitions Incorporated is impressed by the franchise's success. Omin Dran does whatever he can to backstop the characters' efforts to find the ritual site, even as he directs other franchises and operatives to seek the site as well. (In the end, the characters will conveniently be the ones to locate the ritual site, but it should be clear that the entire organization takes the impending end of the world as seriously as they do.)

Omin is also troubled because he's lost contact with the members of the "C" Team (see *appendix A*). The members of that franchise have been actively seeking the Six, and Omin hopes that they might simply be in the midst of an operation with no chance to report in. But just in case, he asks the characters to keep an eye out for them. The fate of the "C" Team—and the possible fate of all Faerûn—will be revealed to the characters as they charge toward the grand finale of the adventure!
---
# Episode 6: Showdown with the Six
![[089-04-46.png|right|300]]

The characters (now 6th level) have learned that the *Orrery of the Wanderer* channels magic even more powerful than intended by its creator, the lich Lottie. As such, Lottie broke the orrery into parts and scattered those parts far and wide, hoping that no one would discover their secret. But the enigmatic group known as the Six has collected at least one orrery component (perhaps more, depending on events in *episode 5*), and its agents now attempt to use those components to open a portal to the Far Realm.

After a suitable amount of questing and research, the characters locate the ritual site, which they learn is in the small town of Red Larch. That settlement is the childhood home of Omin Dran and the stomping grounds of the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise known as the "C" Team, whose members have recently gone missing.

The characters speed toward Red Larch, where they find foes allied with the Six guarding the Dran & Courtier inn. That otherwise quiet establishment has always possessed unusual magical qualities, but these have been warped by the slowly opening portal to the Far Realm. The characters can interact with the local townsfolk, learning that the members of the "C" Team entered the inn but have not returned. Likewise, the inn's co-owner and proprietor, Propha Dran, has not been seen since the planar strangeness suffusing the inn started.

When the characters enter, the Dran & Courtier appears normal at first. But opening any of its interior doors causes the entire site to transform under the watchful eye of an agent of the Six known as the Keymaster. A nightmare version of the Dran & Courtier is revealed, filled with aberrant horrors. Defeating the horrors of this incarnation of the inn returns the characters to the actual inn.

A second transformation turns the characters into miniature heroes as they are greeted by Splugoth the Returned. On behalf of the Six, the wily goblin asks the characters to surrender their orrery components—and then releases **Onyx**, the giant (relative to the characters) inn's cat, upon them. Successfully fleeing from **Onyx** transforms the inn once more.

In the final stage, the characters discover the members of the "C" Team fallen in combat and must fight the horrid Far Realm creature that slew them. Doing so brings those NPC heroes back to life. Once the Keymaster has been subsequently bested, the characters can open a final door leading to a dark series of dimensional caverns—and the lair of an ancient deep crow. That terrible creature is sure to defeat the characters, unless they can determine that it's suffering from a deep depression and desperately seeks a mate. Successfully playing the part of deep crow relationship counselor allows the characters to continue on, finally reaching the portal site.

Splugoth is in control of the ritual and has defenses in place to prevent the meddling characters from thwarting his plans. As the characters face off against a mutated Far Realm goblin horde, Splugoth's control of the orrery components that fuel the ritual lets him summon forth twisted, evil versions of some of Acquisitions Incorporated's most famous members. Oh, and there's a thing where the ritual keeps resurrecting Splugoth every time the characters kill him.

In the end, clever thinking and a measure of luck might allow the heroes to keep Splugoth dead, seize control of the orrery components, and end the ritual. If victorious, the characters will earn accolades from Head Office for a job well done!

And the world will be safe from destruction. That's always a plus.

## Seeking the Ritual Site
In the course of locating the ritual site (see "Franchise Downtime" in *episode 5*), the characters might travel to any number of locations, either to confirm that those locations are not the ritual site or to gain additional information or magic useful in the search for the real site. If you want to set up a prolonged search for the site, any of the following iconic locations along the Sword Coast might make an interesting stop for the characters. Each location offers the potential to gain information regarding sites known for planar disturbances or strange magic, or to seek lore and materials to refine the operation of the characters' portalometer.

#### Candlekeep
The many towers of the largest and most storied library in all Faerûn are the perfect place to search for clues leading to the location or nature of the ritual site, or to find instructions for crafting a portalometer. Gaining lore or befriending the monks of the library could reveal that someone else recently came to Candlekeep to inquire into the nature of portals to other dimensions. In fact, this representative of the Six was studying the very tomes the characters are now investigating!

To dial up the action in an otherwise studious scene, remember that research in Candlekeep is never entirely safe. Opening a particular book might lead to a pocket dimension, conjure up a fiend, or create any other distraction of your design. More information on *Candlekeep* can be found in the *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*.

#### Mantol-Derith
Duergar, drow, and svirfneblin trade and exchange information in the city of Mantol-Derith deep in the Underdark. A deep gnome sage named Lunicifer dwells in the city, living in a crumbling home on the shores of the Darklake. A half-mad servant of a forgotten deity named Azmekidom, Lunicifer has been researching planar disturbances for more than a century and can provide the characters with insight or research—if the party helps him with his dangerous errands. These side trek missions might include stealing a magic item from a drow noble house, gathering unique fungus from a mind flayer's garden, and other potentially deadly tasks. More information on Mantol-Derith can be found in *Out of the Abyss* and the *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*.

#### Neverwinter
Depending on how much time the characters spent in Neverwinter in *episode 3*, they might have heard tales of how the Spellplague (the great magical devastation that tore across Faerûn more than a century ago) tore a large chasm through the city. This chasm (helpfully known as "the Chasm") has since been sealed, but pockets of blue spellfire and the warping effects of planar energy can often still be seen in the area.

The characters can make use of contacts from *episode 3* to determine that agents of the Six appeared recently in Neverwinter and were rumored to have been researching the magic of the Chasm. Tracking down any agents who remain might allow the characters to gain hints regarding the ritual's location. You might also decide that these Six agents have been warped by the latent energy of the Chasm, making them formidable and unpredictable foes.

More information on *Neverwinter* can be found in the *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*.

#### Kryptgarden Forest
This dread forest abutting the Sword Mountains is the demesne of the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar. That terrible and cruel beast—known as Old Gnawbone for her habit of flying over the forest with a corpse in her jaws as a light snack—has long dominated Kryptgarden with her evil presence.

The forest is also home to a dryad named Ishaldra, who studies how evil magic can alter locations in the world. She can help the characters learn how to detect powerful magical essences, but only if they can elude Claugiyliamatar and the other dark creatures that dwell within the forest.

More information on Kryptgarden and **Claugiyliamatar** can be found in the adventures *Princes of the Apocalypse* and *Storm King's Thunder*.

## The Moon Glade
This section expands on one location the characters might journey to as part of their search for the Six's ritual site.

#### Research and Requisitions
As the characters work to perfect their portalometer, they hear of a site deep in the High Forest not far from the Star Mounds, known as the Moon Glade. The waters of the Moon Glade rest upon an intersection of magical ley lines, tied to the weave of the world. The glade's waters are thick like mercury and said to have powerful properties of divination. The characters might also learn that the glade is protected by a powerful natural guardian. Or you could keep that information to yourself.

#### Investigating the Glade
The characters can use their mobile headquarters to reach the Moon Glade easily enough. When they finally arrive at the site, read the following:

>>The Moon Glade is a secluded clearing, roughly eighty feet in diameter, with half that space taken up by the pool of water at its center. Huge ancient trees around the perimeter tower overhead, allowing only a narrow slice of sky to illuminate the pool's silvery surface. The pool is surrounded by a circle of huge standing stones, all inscribed with strange writing.
>>

***Inscribed Stones.*** Anyone able to read Druidic can read the writing on the stones, all of which makes reference to divination and magic. The stones of the pool were brought here by visiting druids using large beasts or magical transportation, but any magic they might possess is dormant during this encounter.

***Tainted Guardian.*** The Moon Glade is protected by Garalel, a weeping willow **treant**. She is cantankerous and ancient, and presently has iconic affiliate of the Six features (see "*Iconic Faction Features*" in *appendix B*). Garalel became tainted by the Six when Splugoth and other members of that organization recently used the pool to seek out their ritual site.

Garalel initiates combat by animating trees, following up with her Glimpse of the Beyond feature. Characters can see that her bark is covered in dark, foul-smelling moss. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check identifies the bark as magically tainted. Dealing damage to Garalel harms her but also breaks off large pieces of the tainted bark and moss. When she is reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, enough corrupted bark has been sloughed off that the treant regains her senses and stops fighting.

A character can also use an action to throw water from the pool onto Garalel. Each time she is splashed so, it helps cleanse the dark magic binding her and increases the hit point total at which she regains her senses by 10.

If Garalel regains her senses, she apologizes profusely. She allows the characters to approach the pool and tells them how the members of the Six used its waters to determine the ideal location for a dark ritual. Knowing that their actions contaminated the pool, she drew that corruption into herself instead.

#### Completing the Mission
What the characters get out of this side trek depends on where it fits in the longer process of perfecting a portalometer or eliminating possible ritual sites. Depending on the goal, Garalel can allow the characters to use the pool's divination power to seek the ritual site, to take a sample of the glade's magical waters for use in their portalometer, or what have you.

## Mission to Red Larch
At whatever point in the search process you deem appropriate, the characters narrow down the search for the ritual site to a final location: the settlement of Red Larch on the western side of the Dessarin Valley. This small town services passing caravans and has a large quarry from which local folk mine marble favored by the wealthy of Waterdeep. A wagon can reach Waterdeep from Red Larch in seven days, and the town of Phandalin is six days away on foot.

Red Larch is also the hometown of Omin Dran and the location of the Dran family business—the Dran & Courtier inn and restaurant. As the characters soon discover, this is not a coincidence. The *Princes of the Apocalypse* adventure contains more information on Red Larch and the surrounding region. As with Phandalin, this version of Red Larch is set about five years later than that earlier adventure.

How the characters arrive in Red Larch is likely determined by what they suspect or have learned regarding the defenses the Six have set up around the ritual. They might choose a stealthy incursion in the dead of night, to roar straight in aboard a mobile franchise headquarters at midday, or any approach in between. But however they first enter the town, the characters quickly confirm that the Six's ritual is already underway.

>>Something is seriously wrong in Red Larch. The Dran & Courtier inn can be seen at the crossroads near the center of town easily enough. But the beams of purple energy emanating from the establishment are decidedly unusual, as is the presence of frightened townsfolk corralled in a pen nearby. Then, of course, there's the small force of bugbears guarding the pen and the gnolls surrounding the inn. That doesn't look right at all.
>>

The amount of time the characters spend skulking around town is up to them. Each time they investigate a feature noted below, roll a d10. On a roll of 1, a patrol of two **nothics** working for the Six attempts to ambush the party from the cover of nearby buildings, attacking with surprise if not seen.

#### Corralled Townsfolk
Twenty locals have been gathered by Six operatives in a fenced-in yard behind Ironhead Arms, a shop selling new and used weapons and armor. Three townsfolk are currently plotting an escape, but they fear that the other captured folk are not prepared for battle. The three are the shop's owner Ironhead (NG male half-orc **veteran**), the town's constable Harburk (LG male human **veteran**), and an explorer from out of town named Silvana (CG female human **scout**). The three work with any characters who help defend the townsfolk.

Guarding the yard are ten **bugbears** that have been instructed to safeguard the prisoners—but only because it isn't clear to Splugoth whether the ritual might eventually require humanoid sacrifices. The bugbears are focused on watching their captives, and have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice anyone approaching them. If the characters free the captives, Ironhead, Harburk, and Silvana offer to lead the other townsfolk to safety.

#### North Side of Town
Though these shops and houses look deserted at first, the characters catch periodic glimpses of frightened townsfolk peering through shuttered windows, or hear them trying to barricade doors with furniture. A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check or good roleplaying can convince the locals to share what they know.

One of the NPCs the characters could meet is Imdarr Relvaunder (LN male human **priest**). Imdarr is hiding with four other townsfolk (male and female **commoners**). He won't leave the others, but he casts any of his useful spells on the adventurers if he believes they are earnest about helping Red Larch.

#### South Side of Town
As described above, characters can spot frightened townsfolk within the houses and other buildings, and can question them with appropriate Charisma checks or roleplaying. Scouting around the area also reveals the odd sight of an unconscious **bugbear** wrapped up in a floral print dress.

Approaching the bugbear draws the attention of Haeleeya Hanadroum (NG female human **commoner**), who is holed up in her bathhouse and dress shop. Haeleeya knocked the bugbear unconscious after winning an unlikely battle against it by dropping flowerpots on its head from the second-story landing. She tied it up in several of her dresses, and is now wondering what to do with it.

Haeleeya is glad to hand the characters her captive bugbear, which is happy to tell the characters everything it knows in exchange for staying alive. It tells how the bugbears were employed by the Six and ordered to round up twenty captives in case the Six needed them for some ritual, though it knows nothing more than that.

#### The Dran & Courtier

>>As you draw closer, you see the sign marking the Dran & Courtier swinging slowly despite the absence of any breeze. Purple light continues to seep out through roof tiles, shuttered windows, and the closed front door.
>>

Even in daylight, the building is shrouded by shadows, as if every part of the inn is somehow in the shade. Ringing the building are twenty **gnolls**, arranged in four packs of five. Even the fearless gnolls are weirded out by the strange lights emanating from the inn. The characters can engage the gnolls head-on or attempt to take them out stealthily. Because the mercenaries are on edge, they can be easily distracted by a fire, recruiting NPCs to draw them off, illusions, or other clever strategies.

Once the gnolls have been dealt with, the characters are free to enter the Dran & Courtier. The incursion of the inn and restaurant plays out as four distinct stages, each channeling a unique version of the establishment—and forcing the characters to face off against the effects of the dark magic churning within.

## Stage 1: The Dran & Courtier?
The Dran & Courtier is normally a fine inn run by Prophetess "Propha" Dran, who happens to be Omin Dran's mother, and her wife, Audra Courtier. The inn is a favorite of locals and travelers alike, but it also serves another purpose. When someone carrying an acorn whose cap is dipped in gold (usually given to them by Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office) passes through the door, they end up in an extradimensional version of the inn known as the Test Market.

The Test Market is meant to test new recruits to Acquisitions Incorporated, and it has several known versions. The multifaceted extradimensional nature of the Dran & Courtier makes it an ideal location for the *Orrery of the Wanderer* to channel the extraplanar magic of the Six's ritual. A convenient number of days before the characters discovered the portal site, Splugoth accessed the extradimensional space and began the process of opening the portal. Energy from the Far Realm has infused several versions of the Test Market, making them even more dangerous than usual—including one version that has already defeated the "C" Team.

Map 6.1 shows the layout of this episode's Test Market versions of the Dran & Courtier.

![[091-map-6-1-pc.jpg|right|300]]
#### The Keymaster's Plans
One of the seemingly ordinary inhabitants of the inn is an agent of the Six. Known as the Keymaster, the agent is a **doppelganger** presently posing as Prophetess "Propha" Dran (see area 3). The doppelganger holds a portal key that allows it to select which version of the Test Market the characters access when they open one of the inn's interior doors. It does so in the hope of destroying anyone attempting to interfere with Splugoth's ritual.

The Keymaster runs the characters through new versions of the warped Test Market until its identity is discovered. Once caught, the Keymaster can be forced to open the inn's basement door—revealing the dimensional caverns leading to the ritual site.

#### Advancing to Stage 2 and Beyond
Until the characters confront the Keymaster, they advance to the next stage of the Test Market every time they open a door within the default version of the inn. Opened doors remain open, so the characters can explore the rooms beyond when they return from whatever stage is triggered by opening the door. Any treasure or other objects claimed in a stage stay with the characters.

The Test Market is not advanced when NPCs open the doors, since the Keymaster has control of the inn's magic. As such, the NPCs stuck in the main stage (see below) wander around the inn as they please. If calculating characters think to have an NPC open a door for them, it advances the Test Market to the next stage for them only, plus any NPCs that appear in the next stage.

*Stop by the Dran & Courtier if you're ever in Red Larch. In late summer, preferably. Come hungry.*— Omin Dran
#### 1. Main Door
The inn's windows, chimneys, and other access points are all magically sealed. They cannot be opened from inside or out, and are impervious to spells and damage. The main door opens easily, but a wall of purple light blocks the view inside. Characters must step through the door to take stock of what lies beyond.

>>The door of the Dran & Courtier is neither locked nor trapped—though the building emanates strange sounds, shakes as though it's falling apart, and continues to radiate a strange purple energy. As soon as you step through the door, though, all the strangeness stops.
>>
>>You see a perfectly ordinary inn, its common room featuring five round tables. Two of those tables are occupied by typical patrons, while two other people stand at the bar. A sleek house cat sizes you up as it paces across the floor, stalking some unseen prey. Oddly, the interior space of the inn seems slightly out of sync with the exterior—almost as if you've stepped into somewhere else. But even as you ponder this, the front door closes behind you, and you notice everyone in the inn glance your way expectantly.
>>

![[092-04-48.png|right|300]]

The door closes behind the characters as soon as they are all inside. Powerful magic imbued into the door makes it impossible to hold it open, as it pushes anything blocking it out of the way. Characters attempting to hold the door become suddenly distracted, unable to remember why they were doing so. Characters who refuse to enter the inn feel oddly compelled to move forward. Just get everyone inside. You'll make it work.

Once closed, the door cannot be opened or damaged. Teleportation and other modes of extradimensional travel fail in the Dran & Courtier, and magic cannot be used to view or communicate with the outside world.

***Door Magic.*** If the characters open any of the interior doors of the Dran & Courtier, it advances the Test Market to the next stage. When this happens the first time, see the section "Stage 2: Little Inn of Horrors" below. See also "Advancing to Stage 2 and Beyond" above.

#### 2. Common Room

>>Two male humans are quietly eating a meal at one of the common room tables, while a young male and female human and an elderly female human sit at another. A fireplace occupies the corner closest to the door, burning brightly, and a chandelier above the common room provides additional light from its tall candles. Hanging over the fireplace is a portrait of three children, two female and one male. The male is clearly a young Omin Dran.
>>
>>Next to the fireplace is an unoccupied raised stage where a bard might strike up a tune. The bar is to your left, where a half-elf in a heavy leather duster receives a drink from a tall female elf wearing a gold medallion. Stairs beyond the bar lead up to a balcony on the second floor. Eight doors along the open upstairs hallways likely lead to bedrooms.
>>

The characters can explore the common room and speak to any patrons they wish.

***Long Lunch.*** The table farthest from the door is occupied by Sigil MacFinn, a tall and strong wagon worker, and his squat friend, a carpenter who goes by the name of Whiskey (both N male human **guards**). The two are complete opposites: Sigil composed and pleasant, Whiskey uncouth and short-tempered. They have been in the inn's restaurant for a long time. The outside doors simply don't work for them. However, they enjoy the free food, and as long as they aren't speaking to each other, they get along well. When someone talks to them, their contrasting personalities erupt and arguments break out. They go back to being quiet and happy if left alone.

Anyone making it through the arguments can learn that these two came in for lunch one day and have never left (they disagree as to how many days they've been here). They have seen a number of strange, shady people coming and going, including some who wore cloaks to conceal their features. The doors seemed to work for those people. They suggest speaking to Propha, the barkeep and owner, who always appears to be trying to remember something.

*The following official Acquisitions Incorporated beers are now available for resale (at regular wholesale discounts) and for franchise parties (at full cost; less drinking, more working, okay?):*

- War Priest Dark Ale
- Red Larch Regular
- Velvet Curtain
- Waelvur's Wood Stain
- Lord's Favor
- Little Dagger
- Mother Tongue
- Cold Comfort
- Summer Gold
- Widow's Wake

***Reservation on Hold.*** The three people at the table nearest the door include Luna and Thalen (CG female and male human **commoners**), the adolescent servants of a wandering wizard named Thed. They were sent to the Dran & Courtier to reserve a room for their master, and though they keep trying to leave, the outside door doesn't open for them. Bored, they have begun to make notes of everything around them. They have noticed that the mice appear very intelligent, ably eluding the inn's resident cat, **Onyx**. The dark cat can be seen roaming the area periodically, and keeps an eye on a mouse hole near the fireplace. Luna and Thalen would make excellent wizard hirelings for the franchise if the characters were inclined to train them.

Also sitting at the table is the elderly Tanas (NG female human **scout**), who has been watching over the youngsters and doing her best to keep them out of trouble. All three can share that strangers come and go, with the main door always closing behind them before anyone else can get out. The strangers often head into the door to the right of the bar. Others have gone upstairs.

#### 3. Bar
Two figures at the bar offer additional conversational possibilities—including the owner of the inn, who is not what she appears.

***Diplomatic Observer.*** Chance (N half-elf **spy**) is a Waterdavian diplomat who has been trapped here for days. Chance has no particular use for gender, preferring to be known simply by their nickname. Chance has seen some strange people come and go, including one in cowled robes who seemed to be a mass of eyes and mouths. There was also a goblin who walked around as if he owned the place. If the characters ask, the goblin matches Splugoth's smirking, pale-eyed description.

***Forgetful Owner.*** Prophetess "Propha" Dran, the proprietor of the Dran & Courtier, manages the bar ably, pouring drinks and bringing out platters of food (no charge). She appears oblivious to the bar's problems, as if she has never noticed them. This Propha is secretly a **doppelganger** and is also the Keymaster, though she/it pretends to be the addled owner who is trying to help the characters. When Propha is asked any questions, characters can attempt a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the doppelganger's Charisma (Deception) check, which is usually made with advantage thanks to its Read Thoughts feature.

If the character's check fails, the character perceives that "Propha" truly wants to help the characters, but is unable to do so for some reason. The barkeep often fidgets with the medallion she wears, especially when trying to remember something. A DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) check notes that priests often wear such medallions, engraved with their holy symbol, but this one is blank.

***Behind the Bar.*** Propha keeps a supply of magic potions in tall, thin, color-coded bottles: three *potions of invisibility*, a *potion of poison*, and three potions that confer the benefit of a *greater restoration* spell. The Keymaster is aware of the potions and uses a *potion of invisibility* to get away from the characters if things go badly. See "Confronting the Keymaster" below.

*Running a Yum Yum Hut is the single most important moment in a person's life. It's more important than marriage or the birth of an offspring. It eclipses all other things. So when picking proper employees, I can't stress this enough—you really need to make sure they have at least six fingers.*— Donaar Blit'zen
#### 4. Kitchen and Larder
The doors to this area, once opened and after the characters have returned to this scene, lead to a perpetually well-stocked kitchen. A food preparation table set with storage cabinets stands against one wall. Food is always ready on the table as if Propha had just prepared it, reappearing moments after it is served. Any common cooking ingredients and supplies, in addition to ale and wine, can be found in the adjoining larder.

#### 5. Propha and Audra's Room
Propha and Audra's bedroom is next to the common room, so they can hear any disturbances at night.

#### 6. Door to the Basement
A door adjacent to the bar should lead under the second-floor stairs and down into the inn's basement. Instead, anyone opening it glimpses a bricked-over doorway before the next stage is triggered. The door remains open when the characters return, but shows only a brick wall until the Keymaster opens the door, revealing the dimensional caverns leading to the ritual site.

#### 7. Upstairs Rooms
The upstairs landing features four doors along each wall, leading into eight bedrooms. Each bedroom has another door, leading into a shared study (area 8). The door from any bedroom into the study can be accessed without triggering a new stage of the Test Market, but any door opened into a bedroom triggers a new stage.

Each of these four guest rooms is presently empty, but a search of the rooms and a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check locates a silver ring under a carpet in one room—a *ring of free action*, forgotten by a guest.

#### 8. Shared Study
These areas connect to the four rooms adjacent to them, and contain a table, chairs, and bookshelves. The shared study connected to the "C" Team's quarters (area 9) contains books, notes, and maps related to their exploits, as well as mundane personal effects. The shared study connected to the inn's currently empty rooms contains a selection of generic fiction works and travelogues detailing the Sword Coast.

#### 9. "C" Team Quarters
The four rooms above the bar and kitchen are always rented by the "C" Team, with each room's characteristics reflecting the person renting it.

Rosie Beestinger's room has a simple floor mat used for stretching and exercises, sheaths holding maps, and a training dummy that has been beaten nearly to the breaking point.

K'thriss Drow'b has a neat room decorated in black and purple, a crystal ball that displays only a haze of smoke, and a collection of strange purple rocks.

Walnut Dankgrass's room has recycling and reuse bins, is decorated with several plants and vines, and has a stack of steamy love letters bearing the initials B.L. and a bottle of wine by the bedside table.

Donaar Blit'zen's room smells like a college dorm, has exercise equipment in one corner, three boxes of delicious snacks bearing the Big Daddy Donaar's Yum Yum Hut brand, an autographed pin-up scroll of a band named Sixty Wrong Sausages, and a wall calendar where every month bears his likeness.

## Stage 2: Little Inn of Horrors
The Test Market warps reality the moment any character opens a door within the Dran & Courtier. The first time this happens, all the characters find themselves back in the common room of the inn (area 2), as if they had just walked through the main door.

>>You are standing just inside the front door to the Dran & Courtier. Things are a bit different, however. The fireplace burns with purple flame. Swinging from the chandelier above the center of the common room is a red-haired figure in a green shirt and red cape. He appears to be having a grand time.
>>
>>Sigil the wagon worker and Whiskey the carpenter are talking and laughing in loud voices at their table, plates heaped with food before them. At their table, Luna and Thalen are taking turns prestidigitating small flames and colored lights, to the delight of Tanas. No one sits at the bar, but Propha Dran is clearing up empty glasses where the half-elf Chance was sitting before. She looks up at you and mouths the words, "Be careful." She then goes back to absentmindedly cleaning the bar.
>>

This is a version of the Test Market where everything has gone wrong.

![[093-04-49.png|right|300]]

#### Not What They Seem
The figure swinging from the chandelier appears to be Viari (met at the end of episode 2)—but he and the scout Tanas are actually two **gibbering mouthers**. Illusion magic cloaks their appearance, though anyone touching them or succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check can see through the illusion. If the illusion is detected, all the characters see the gibbering mouthers in their true forms as both creatures attack.

Luna, Thalen, Sigil, and Whiskey are hosts for four **intellect devourers**, having been overcome by those creatures' Body Thief action. Speaking to any of them and succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check confirms that they are not themselves, as they display slightly warped personalities. The four attack when they or the gibbering mouthers are discovered (use their **guard** or **commoner** stat blocks). When a host is reduced to 0 hit points, the intellect devourer emerges and attempts to use its claws and Devour Intellect action to gain a character as a new host.

A character can regain any lost intellect with one of Propha's special *potions of *greater restoration**, though the potions are present only in the default version of the Dran & Courtier (see "Stage 1").

#### Horrid Kitchen
When the fight is done, the characters hear noise from the kitchen.

>>As the battle ends, you hear a muffled thumping sound, as if something is striking wood. The sound comes from the kitchen.
>>

The characters can safely open the door to the kitchen (and any doors in the inn other than the outside door, which still does not open). They might also explore Propha and Audra's room (finding it unremarkable) or head upstairs (see "Upstairs Bedrooms" below). Entering area 4 reveals a most macabre version of the inn's kitchen.

>>The transformed kitchen's shelves contain all manner of ingredients suitable for a hag's den, including bat wings, dried lizards, and far too many humanoid skulls. A trash can stands in one corner, with a small iron-bound chest next to it. On the kitchen's preparation table sits a spectacularly long butcher's knife surrounded by severed fingers. Other equally questionable meats are arranged nearby. A pot on the stove threatens to boil over, its lid rattling. You hear the thumping noise again, coming from the cabinets underneath the preparation table.
>>

Both the knife and the bubbling pot are dangerous, and the cabinet holds a captured flumph. At the end of each character's turn, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, the boiling pot boils over (see below).

***Creature.*** The gleaming butcher's knife is a **mimic**. The creature waits until it is picked up to trigger its Adhesive trait. If a creature is attacked by the mimic, the boiling pot's lid comes off.

***Boiling Pot.*** The boiling pot acts as a trap. A character examining the pot and succeeding on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot glimpses of tentacles beneath the rattling lid, and notes that the lid will fly off if the pressure continues to mount. As an action, a character can attempt a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools or cook's utensils to disable the pot, either by relieving the pressure safely or moving the pot off the fire without the lid coming off.

The stove has no discernible fuel source or way to turn off its heat. If the lid comes off or is removed, an explosion of tentacles and scalding water fills the kitchen. Each character in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and 5 (1d10) fire damage. The trap acts on initiative count 10, repeating this effect each turn until a character uses an action to replace the lid. Even with the lid on, the pot boils over again in 1d4 rounds unless disabled, as noted above.

***Cabinet.*** The cabinet is locked, requiring a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to pick or a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check to break open. Locked inside is a **flumph** named Phfffffffft. If freed, Phfffffffft shares how it sensed the aberrant horrors in this pocket dimension and came to help, but was captured. It heard the name "Splugoth" used by some of the creatures passing through the horrid inn. Phfffffffft also recalls someone discussing a terrifying guardian that protects "the dimensional caverns." The flumph can accompany the characters back to the default Test Market if they wish, helping them as best it can in future encounters (and probably dying horribly).

***Chest.*** The iron-bound chest has a simple lock requiring a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to open, and contains packets and jars of spices. Among these is a small packet containing *dust of sneezing and choking*, another of *dust of dryness*, and a jar of *Keoghtom's ointment*.

#### Upstairs Bedrooms
In this version of the Test Market inn, all the rooms upstairs (areas 7 and area 8) are empty except for one room of your choice. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check or who has a passive Wisdom (Perception score of 12 or higher can hear slurping and chewing sounds from that area.

***Creatures.*** Inside the room are two **chuuls**. One has grappled Chance (from area 3), and both are feasting on the unconscious half-elf spy. The chuul drops Chance as combat begins, leaving the spy unconscious with two failed death saving throws. Chance makes a death saving throw at the end of each round.

If the chuuls are defeated and Chance is saved and revived, the spy can share that they were ambushed by goblins and thrown upstairs to be eaten by the chuuls. Chance heard the goblins talking about a ritual with someone named Splugoth in charge.

***Treasure.*** In this reality, a small chest by the bed in the chuul room contains a *rod of the pact keeper +2*.

#### Advancing to Stage 3
When the creatures in the common room and upstairs have been defeated, the characters feel the reality around them unravel as they are returned to the default inn of stage 1. As before, opening another door in the default version of the inn advances the characters to stage 3.

## Stage 3: Feeling Small

>>You are standing just inside the front door to the Dran & Courtier. The inn is seemingly deserted—or not. No one is in sight, but you see food and drink moving on several tables. A mug is lifted as if to an unseen mouth. A chair shifts like someone's leaning back in it. But there's no one there.
>>
>>Suddenly, the ceiling begins to rise away from you. Then you notice that the closest table is growing, as are the floor boards beneath your feet. The entire inn is expanding—or maybe you're shrinking. Assuming the rest of the inn is its usual size, by the time the effect stops, you are each no more than six inches tall.
>>

The characters and all their equipment are reduced in size by the magic of the Test Market. This version of the inn is, in fact, empty, but the objects in it continue to move as if manipulated by creatures.

Allow the characters some time to explore their new environment. They can use ropes to climb tables or chairs, avoid chunks of discarded food the size of their heads, and see the inn from an entirely different perspective. They cannot detect any magical effect upon themselves that could be ended, and the resizing appears permanent.

#### Splugoth's Bargain
When the characters have had a bit of time to adjust to their diminutive state, read:

>>A loud voice calls from above, dripping with disdain. "Hello there, members of Acquisitions Incorporated!" Peering through the rails of the second-floor balcony is a smirking goblin with one pale eye who towers over you in your present forms. "Listen up, bugs! And welcome to the most important bargaining session of your lives." The goblin walks haughtily toward the stairs. "I am Splugoth the Returned. Surely you know who I am?"
>>

Splugoth can't conceal being pleased if the characters know that he once worked with Acquisitions Incorporated. In fact, he is enraged if they do not know his past. He fills in the details as needed, underscoring the travesty of his treatment from his own biased perspective. The goblin approaches the characters and takes a seat at a table where he can see them. Use the following possible dialogue to guide the conversation:

![[094-04-50.png|right|300]]

- "I was a young, up-and-coming goblin. Like any other goblin, filled with hopes and dreams."
- "A sorcerer named Kalarel employed me and other goblins to harry townsfolk while they opened a portal trying to free a Shadowfell death god. Look, it was work."
- "Acquisitions Incorporated foiled Kalarel's plans. Sure, partly due to a bargain I forged with Acquisitions Incorporated. But I was left to die all alone when one of Omin Dran's friends was in trouble. Death is overrated."
- "Fortunately, there are real heroes, and they hate Acquisitions Incorporated! Jeff Magic, an awesome lich who was also betrayed by Jim and Omin, resurrected me. Now I'm Splugoth the Returned! I've been given real responsibilities, including coordinating goblin raids. Goblins just attacking here or there? Oh, you have no idea. We have big plans. It's all coming together, you'll see."
- "And now I have my greatest responsibility: crushing Acquisitions Incorporated once and for all."

If Splugoth was ridiculously successful in episode 5 and the Six now possess all the orrery components except the *wheel of stars*, he's mostly just here to gloat. But no matter how many components the characters still possess, he offers the following sweet deal.

>>"See, you must know that I'm all about business—something Omin and Jim were too blind to see. This, between you and me? It's not personal. It's commerce. I can make you a deal. You give me your orrery components, and I let you live. We both profit. Easy, right?"
>>

Splugoth laughs darkly if the characters are foolish enough to give him their orrery components (which resize when he takes them), or when his deal is refused. The goblin whistles loudly a moment before he teleports away, followed by the heavy footsteps of something enormous and furry approaching from behind the bar.

#### Onyx Ascendant

>>The cat stepping out from behind the bar looks gigantic from your current height. **Onyx** walks in nonchalantly, yawns, and drops down on the floor to lick herself. Suddenly, a shimmering portal opens up in the middle of the room. You hear Splugoth laughing again as a ball of yarn pops through the portal before it vanishes. **Onyx** sits up, suddenly attentive, her eyes following the ball as it unravels toward you.
>>

This scene takes place entirely in the common room of the Dran & Courtier, since none of the interior doors of this version of the inn can be opened. All the characters use their normal speed for movement, but you multiply the dimensions of the common room and any furniture or objects in it by a factor of 10. For example, relative to the characters the length of the bar is 300 feet, while a stool that stands 3 feet high is effectively 30 feet high.

The characters are free to move wherever they can, or to climb objects in the room. Additionally, at the end of each character's turn as they try to avoid **Onyx**, roll on the Cat Chase Complications table below to see what happens, or use the table as inspiration for your own complications.

**Onyx** uses the **cat** stat block with these changes:

- Her size (relative to the characters in their diminutive state) is Huge.
- Her speed (relative to the characters) is ten times normal. This gives her a speed of 400 feet and a climbing speed of 200 feet.
- Any damage **Onyx** would take is reduced to 0 (but see "Dealing with **Onyx**" below).
- She has advantage on ability checks and saving throws.
- Her claws attack uses the following statistics: +7 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit*: 11 (2d10) slashing damage.

**Onyx**'s relative speed likely allows her to move anywhere within the inn on her turn. On her turn, she uses her action to make a Claws attack against a random character if she can.

***Dealing with Onyx.*** **Onyx** cannot be overcome or killed by combat. Any weapon attack against her that hits AC 12 makes contact but deals no lasting damage. However, if the attack would deal 10 or more damage, **Onyx** has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of her next turn. If **Onyx** would take 10 or more damage from spells or other effects, it yields the same result. Spells that impose conditions function normally against **Onyx**, but those conditions end automatically at the end of the cat's next turn.

***Ending the Chase.*** **Onyx** continues her "playful" chase as long as she can see any living characters. Only if all the characters successfully hide from her does she eventually give up. The characters might determine another location to hide at your discretion, but the mouse hole near the fireplace makes an obvious and effective safe spot.

During the chase, any character within view of the fireplace whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher spots the mouse hole. A character specifically seeking a ground-level hiding place can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check from anywhere in the common room to spot the mouse hole, with advantage on the check. At their reduced size, the characters can easily slip through the mouse hole to escape **Onyx**.

*My mother must be getting new cats and just calling them **Onyx**. Otherwise, **Onyx** would be coming up on fifty years old. And I don't think that's how cats work.*— Omin Dran
##### Cat Chase Complications
| d20 | Complication |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A tumbling chair or other large obstacle blocks the character's path. The character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to maneuver over, under, or to the side of the obstacle. On a failed check, the character's speed is halved until the end of their next turn. |
| 2 | A small stool is tipped over, or a mug or plate goes flying off a table. The character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to dodge it. On a failed save, the character is struck a glancing blow for 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. |
| 3 | A previously unseen patch of spiderweb, chewing gum, or mud catches a character as they move. The character must succeed on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to push through without becoming stuck. On a failure, the character's speed is halved until the end of their next turn. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character is restrained until they or another character succeeds on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to free them. |
| 4 | A cloak suddenly slips down from the back of a chair. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check can grab it, pulling it down onto **Onyx**. On her next turn, the cat must use her action to free herself before she can move. |
| 5 | Spilled ale turns the floor beneath the character into a slippery pool. The character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. |
| 6 | The character attracts the attention of three huge cockroaches, and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to pass the enormous insects unimpeded. On a failed check, the character takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage from the roaches' bites, and the character's speed is halved until the end of their next turn. |
| 7 | A bottle falls off a table and rolls toward the character. The character must succeed on a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw to dodge or jump over it. On a failure, the character takes 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. |
| 8 | A plate of food spills, spreading a field of mashed potatoes, butter and jam, or some other thick, sticky substance in the character's path. The character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check to avoid or push through the food. On a failure, the character's speed is halved until the end of their turn. |
| 9 | Three wasps feeding on fallen food catch sight of the character and zoom in. The character must succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check to avoid angering them. On a failure, the character is stung and takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. |
| 10–20 | No complication. |

#### Mouse Den
When the characters reach the mouse hole, they find a small cozy den inside, lined with matted hair and fur. Next to a block of cheese is a bound and unconscious **Propha Dran**, her clothes stained with dried blood. This is the real Propha (see area 3 of the default inn), who is stable but requires healing to return to consciousness. If awakened, she thanks the characters for their rescue, listens to any explanation of how they got there, then shares the following information:

![[095-04-51.png|right|300]]

- Propha was attacked and captured by Splugoth and another goblin (the shapechanged Keymaster). She was tied up and left in this version of the Test Market, presumably to keep her out of the way. Thankfully, Audra Courtier was out of town when the Six's agents attacked.
- She has no idea who the "Propha" in the default version of the inn is. It might be another creature posing as her, but it could also be an actual version of her split off by the Test Market's magic.
- Propha overheard Splugoth talk about the ritual being undertaken in some location called the dimensional caverns. He also bragged that the caverns are guarded by a monster known as an ancient deep crow. Propha can fill the characters in on deep crow lore if they're unfamiliar with those creatures (see *appendix B*), and makes it clear that even one ancient deep crow is a threat the characters cannot expect to overcome by normal means.
- Propha heard the voices of the "C" Team once while fading in and out of consciousness. Given that the characters haven't seen them, she fears that they might be trapped in one of the other versions of the Test Market.

#### Advancing to Stage 4
Shortly after finding Propha, reality shimmers around the characters and they are returned to the default inn of stage 1. The characters are once again their normal size, though the only Propha in the room is the doppelganger behind the bar, wearing her blank medallion. The false Propha claims to have no idea what the characters are talking about if they recount their meeting with her.

As before, the characters stay in this default scene until they open another of the inn's interior doors.

## Stage 4: Revenge for the "C" Team

>>You are standing just inside the front door to the Dran & Courtier. The place is deserted, the tables empty. Everything is in shadow, except where a purple light pulses from the four open bedroom doors above the bar.
>>

This version of the Test Market is empty except for the rooms rented by the "C" Team. When the characters make their way to the second floor, read:

>>All four of the bedrooms along the hall show signs of a fierce battle that took place here—and which has seemingly claimed the lives of Walnut Dankgrass, Donaar Blit'zen, Rosie Beestinger, and K'thriss Drow'b. All four members of the "C" Team lie dead on the floor of their individual bedrooms.
>>
>>The purple light that radiates out from each room pulses out around the edges of the closed interior doors, all of which lead to the shared study beyond.
>>

#### The Fallen
Investigation of the members of the "C" Team confirms that they are truly dead. No magic available to the characters can return them to life, and any magic carried by those adventurers is mysteriously inert. If the characters want to loot the bodies, any treasure they might be carrying is left to your determination. There is nothing of value in any of the bedrooms.

#### Eldritch Horror
When any door into the shared study is opened, the characters see the horror that waits beyond.

>>The far wall of the study is filled by a giant gaping maw. Purple eldritch light seeps out of the maw, bathing the room in a sickly glow. Four massive tentacles covered in eyes and spines flail about the room and immediately reach for you.
>>

This creature is an eldritch horror from the Far Realm, using the stat block of an **otyugh**.

#### The "C" Team Restored
If the characters defeat the eldritch horror, a pulse of magic radiates outward as the maw collapses and vanishes. The members of the "C" Team wake up, freed from the magic that had vanquished them in this version of the Test Market. The characters have a chance to share their story with the NPCs.

The members of the "C" Team know Splugoth well, and can fill the characters in on any information the goblin didn't get around to mentioning in stage 3 (see "Splugoth's Bargain"). They have faced different versions of the Test Market than those seen by the characters, which they talk about if asked (see "Additional Stages" below for inspiration). If they don't presently return to the same version of the Dran & Courtier as the characters (as will prove to be the case), the "C" Team members promise to continue trying to free the inn from the Six's magic.

As thanks for the rescue, K'thriss gifts a pair of *slippers of spider climbing* to the party. The characters then feel themselves being pulled away, back to the default inn of stage 1.

#### After Stage Four
The "C" Team members do not accompany the characters as they are returned to the stage 1 version of the Dran & Courtier, but end up in other stages of the Test Market until the ritual is ended.

## Additional Stages
You are free to add additional stages to the Keymaster's version of the Test Market if the players are having fun with these off-the-wall challenges. Use the following setups, or use them as inspiration for creating your own.

#### Flashback
The inn changes to resemble one of the other inns or taverns the characters have been to previously during the adventure (the Stonehill Inn or the Sleeping Giant in Phandalin, the Fishbone Tavern in Luskan, and so on). The patrons are people the characters have met before, but one of those patrons tells the characters that someone in the establishment is not who they appear to be. Finding the impersonator reveals a powerful monster of your determination, whose defeat ends the stage.

#### Inanimate Trauma
No people are found in the Dran & Courtier, but a number of inanimate objects are sitting in chairs where people once were. Written on a chalkboard that would otherwise announce the inn's meal of the day is the phrase: "The names of things must be arranged and spoken." The first letter of each word in the clue is underlined.

This Test Market is a puzzle in which the first letter in the name of each object that was formerly a person must be scrambled to determine a password. You choose the password, then choose the nature of the objects so that their names provide the needed letters. For example, the password "lamp" could be created from a lock, an arrow, a mirror, and a piton. When the password is spoken, the stage ends.

#### Battle at the Headquarters
The tavern becomes the franchise's headquarters, which is under attack by agents of the Six! For even more chaos, each of the characters temporarily transforms into a franchise staff member using an NPC stat block, so that the players must use those NPCs to repel the attackers. When the battle is over—one way or the other—the stage ends.

#### Too Many Prophas
The tavern appears normal, but it holds three people who look exactly like Propha Dran and none of them are behind the bar. Each time a Propha touches a character or another patron, the person touched turns into a Propha in body and mind, with the players roleplaying that development as they see fit. Whether as themselves or as Propha, the characters must determine which is the original Propha (still secretly the Keymaster) and get it to touch the other Prophas, which turns them back to normal. Once everyone is their former self, the stage ends.

#### Need to Feed
Every patron seen previously in the inn has a head resembling a fleshy ball surrounded by tentacles and a gaping maw where a face should be. These otherworldly creatures are tearing the inn apart and attempting to eat everything they can get their hands on—including the characters.

Fighting the patrons is difficult (use the **dire wolf** stat block for each to underline their fierce bite). But if two of them are forced together (by a character shoving one of them, a *thunderwave* spell, and so forth), they immediately attack and wholly consume each other. When only one patron remains, it transforms into Propha (the Keymaster) and the stage ends.

#### Food Fight
The characters appear behind the bar, with every patron in the inn shouting furiously at them regarding poor service. The patrons begin to hurl food at the characters: +4 to hit, 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage. The patrons are immune to damage from any of the characters' normal attacks and spells. However, each patron is vulnerable to one type of food currently being hurled around the inn. If that type of food hits a patron, they immediately vanish. When all the patrons have been vanquished in this way, the stage ends.

## Confronting the Keymaster
Whether as a result of information gathered during stages of the Test Market, magic brought to bear while talking to "Propha," or simply adventurers' instinct, the characters eventually become aware of the Keymaster's identity. If this happens before the characters have triggered all the presented stages of the Test Market, that's fine. You can have the Keymaster flee through an interior door to generate a new stage (see below). Or you can ignore the later stages and let the characters capture the doppelganger (especially if the players are anxious to get to the ritual site as quickly as possible).

When the Keymaster's true nature is discovered, it shifts to its natural form and engages the characters in combat. The Keymaster uses the **doppelganger** stat block with the iconic affiliate of the Six features (see "*Iconic Faction Features*" in *appendix B*).

The doppelganger leads with Multiattack if it has surprise, to make the most of its Surprise Attack trait. It otherwise uses its Glimpse of the Beyond feature to blind as many foes as possible. It then attempts to drink a *potion of invisibility* and flee.

If you want it to, the Keymaster opening one of the inn's interior doors triggers the next stage of the Test Market. The doppelganger can vanish in that next stage to leave the characters to their own devices, or it can remain in the next stage, engaging the party in combat and attempting to help the threats of that stage finish them off.

The Keymaster bargains for its life if reduced to 35 hit points or fewer, revealing the following if the characters agree to spare it:

- All the versions of the Dran & Courtier—even the "normal" version—are part of the Test Market. Jim Darkmagic foolishly created the Test Market as a way to test (or, you know, torture) applicants to Acquisitions Incorporated. This established the Dran & Courtier as a crossroads between demiplanes, and its planar instability makes it perfect for opening portals to additional dimensions.
- **Splugoth the Returned** does not lead the Six, but he oversees this operation. He hates Acquisitions Incorporated, as does everyone in the Six.
- The components of the *Orrery of the Wanderer* are being used to anchor a complex ritual that will open a portal to the Far Realm. When the portal opens completely, an otherworldly army will emerge to destroy Red Larch, sweep across the Sword Coast, and wipe out Acquisitions Incorporated in the process. Of course, all members of the Six have been promised safe harbor and cushy desk jobs under this new regime.
- The Keymaster's job is to oversee the different Test Market dimensions. It has been allowing servants of the Six into the various Test Markets and the ritual site, while trapping and eliminating anyone coming in to cause trouble—especially meddlesome and pesky adventurers.
- The people within the default version of the inn are ordinary mortals trapped by magic, and must remain in the inn until the ritual is shut down. The real Propha likewise remains trapped in stage 3 of the Test Market until the ritual ends.
- The amulet the doppelganger wears controls which Test Market appears when a door is opened. The amulet can also open the door to the basement, which leads to the dimensional caverns (see below), which in turn lead to the ritual site.
- The Keymaster can use the amulet without needing to make an ability check, and will do so at the characters' request if its life is spared. Anyone else who uses an action to activate the amulet and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can open the basement door.

If the characters control the amulet, they can access any versions of the Test Market, but planar energy continues to course through the Dran & Courtier as a result of Splugoth's ritual. Opening the inn's main doors or contacting NPCs moving through other versions of the Test Market (including the "C" Team) is impossible until the ritual is ended. But once the basement door is opened from within any stage of the Test Market, the characters are ready to enter the dimensional caverns—and to save Faerûn.

## Dimensional Caverns
When the basement door is opened, read:

>>Instead of a basement stairway, a rough stone tunnel stretches away from the Dran & Courtier, quickly widening to a cavernous space studded with purple crystals. The tunnel echoes with strange voices and far-off sounds, as if originating from distant places... or perhaps even distant worlds.
>>

The tunnel is unlit. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check made while investigating the tunnel confirms that it is wholly contained within a pocket dimension. Because the characters have been in possession of the orrery housing and some of its components, they feel the presence of whichever components Splugoth now possesses at some great distance straight ahead.

To provide context for the background noise, tell the players that the characters are hearing snippets from the adventures of the "C" Team and Acquisitions Incorporated. You might even use dialogue from an Acquisitions Incorporated live play session as background sound while the characters traverse the tunnel.

>>The tunnel continues for what feels like forever before the ceiling suddenly begins to rise. The walls frame an impossibly tall canyon that slowly widens, the air becoming hot and heavy with the scent of sulfur. Glowing vents of magma fill a huge cavern with a dull red glow. From somewhere ahead, you hear a deep, echoing caw, sounding like the call of some great bird. It repeats periodically, always far off in the distance.
>>
>>Set into a large cleft in the canyon wall is an enormous nest of sticks, bones, paper, and other debris. An immense black form resembling a crow shelters in the nest. It has a beak that comes together like mandibles, large enough to grasp a horse. Even more unsettling are the multitude of eyes clustered on its forehead, though those are thankfully all closed in sleep.
>>

The **ancient deep crow** in the nest (see *appendix B*) is only pretending to sleep. Any character studying the creature and succeeding on a DC 18 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check notices one of its eyes opening momentarily to a glowing red slit. The deep crow's name is Raah, and it (thankfully) has things on its mind other than eating adventurers, as the characters soon discover.

#### Approaching the Nest
As the characters draw closer, they see a broad expanse of detritus and guano spread out below the nest. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notes that a great amount of that detritus appears to be shredded parchments and bound books—all works destroyed by Raah in various fits of pique.

Either before or after the ancient deep crow awakes, any character can draw close enough to the pile to investigate the destroyed works. These bear such titles as *Twenty Ways to Gain Your Lover*; *Crazy Little Thing Called Love*; *What is Romance*?; *Men are from Abeir, Women are from Toril*; and so forth. Passages on nearly every ruined page are crudely underlined and circled with guano-based pigment.

#### Waking Raah
At whatever point is convenient as the characters inspect the ruined books or try to skirt past the ancient deep crow's nest, Raah angrily "wakes up."

>>A sense of doom pervades the cavern around you as the ancient deep crow suddenly rises up. Its great wings unfurl, its multiple eyes blazing red as it lets loose a caw that shakes the cavern walls.
>>

Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check intuits that despite its aggressive display, at least some of the ancient deep crow's outrage is feigned, and that it appears to be in a deep state of melancholy. Other characters can note that as Raah shifts around its nest, books and scrolls are knocked out to drift to the ground, all focused on the same subject matter as the destroyed works.

*I dislike deep crows immensely. But their eggs when cooked up with cheese are delicious.*— Jim Darkmagic
#### The Hard Way
The characters are free to engage Raah in battle. It has a lot of pent-up rage these days, and is happy to have someone to direct that rage against other than itself. An ancient deep crow is a formidable foe, and Raah does not hold back in combat, opening with its Shadow Caw and carving up characters who dare attack it. Even as the battle unfolds, however, the characters should have the chance to realize that there are other options.

During the fight, Raah shrieks angry epithets in the Deep Crow tongue, such as: "I'll kill you all! Because what else am I good for? No one cares!" If none of the characters understands Deep Crow, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check detects a note of self-recrimination in the creature's savage caw. At the same time, as the ancient deep crow swoops around or a character's *fireball* spell catches the edge of the nest, more parchments might dislodge, revealing underlined passages filled with humanoid dating advice.

At any point at which the characters offer to cease hostilities, or if they are clever enough to negotiate with Raah from the outset, proceed as follows.

#### Dating Advice
Having a character able to speak Deep Crow with the use of a *tongues* spell or similar magic makes dealing with Raah a lot easier. But if not, don't be afraid to explore the comedic value of negotiating with a deadly lovesick monster by way of pantomime and crude art scratched on cavern walls. (The books in the nest are evidence that Raah can understand at least a bit of Common, which might also give the characters a leg up.)

If the characters ask Raah about the books, the ancient deep crow threatens again to kill them all, but holds back from attacking. Give the characters free rein as they attempt to communicate with an otherworldly creature stricken with all-too-worldly relationship woes, using the following points and ability checks as guidelines.

If the characters are supportive and sincere in their attempts to engage the deep crow, you can decide that successful roleplaying and a reasonable number of successful ability checks let them gain Raah's trust. On a badly failed check or in response to a snide comment, Raah might attack again for a round before calming down.

***Understanding Raah.*** A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that Raah is feeling emotionally wounded and unsure of itself. The threats it can manifest in battle are deadly, but the ancient deep crow gets no satisfaction from its combat prowess.

A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Nature) check allows a character to recall obscure lore about deep crows and their reproductive practices. A deep crow mates only once in its lifetime, and Raah has so far been spectacularly unsuccessful in its attempts to find a mate.

A successful DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check encourages Raah to share that its deep crow parent and nest mates taught it only to embrace rage and physical power. It never learned about its emotions or how to listen to others. As a result, the deep crow doesn't know what to say to a potential mate. It just tries to break stuff to impress them.

***Giving Raah Advice.*** A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to quickly assess Raah's reading material determines that the ancient deep crow is highlighting everything, no matter how good or bad the advice might be—and with no thought given to the fact that relationship advice for humanoids has no bearing on its own needs. Raah needs better guidance.

Allow the characters to give Raah any relationship advice that feels apropos. This might involve roleplaying in more ways than one, as a character takes on the part of a prospective deep crow partner and Raah tries to put the advice into practice. If you need mechanics for this scenario, call for DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) checks from each character offering advice to determine how well Raah takes it.

#### Moving On
When the characters have either defeated or befriended Raah, they can continue beyond the ancient deep crow's cavern toward the ritual site.

>>The ancient deep crow's cavernous lair begins to taper down again, revealing another canyon passage ahead. The light of volcanic vents fades behind you as you continue into darkness.
>>

## The End of the World
This is it! The showdown with Splugoth! The moment of truth as the characters battle for control of the orrery and try to stop the world's end!

The read-aloud text below assumes that the Six successfully gained the housing of the *Orrery of the Wanderer* in episode 5. If they don't have the housing, any components the Six have obtained spin in place on their own. (Even if the characters thwarted the Six at every turn, Splugoth holds at least the *far gear*.)

*All franchisees must note: Expenses incurred during extraplanar excursions are NOT eligible for reimbursement.*— Omin DranMap 6.2 shows the setup of the ritual site and the final battle.

>>The inky black space above is now dotted by pulses of purple and green fire. The canyon narrows, then opens again into a cavern, where a broad sandstone rise is lit by sheets of green flame that scour the ceiling. Thin shelves of eroded rock emerge from the center of the rise to create a large central mesa. Ten other goblins stand guard around this promontory, which has twisting steps leading up to where Splugoth stands.
>>
>>A sandstone pillar rises from the mesa before the goblin. Floating above it is the orrery, its clockwork components spinning rapidly, glowing with power. Behind Splugoth is a rift in reality—a purple wound in the world, beyond which you can see goblins with purple eyes, extra limbs, and other strange mutations. The Far Realm goblins push forward, trying to press through the portal and into your world.
>>
>>Splugoth laughs. "You are too late! The ritual is under my control, and now you must hear my most villainous speech! Oh, who am I kidding? Goblins, kill these meddlesome fools! And just to sway the odds, how about some ironic assistance for my minions?" With a flourish, Splugoth manipulates one of the orrery's clockwork components. Four purple-black outlines begin to form before the rift—slowly taking the shape of characters you recognize.
>>

![[096-map-6-2-dm.jpg|right|300]]

#### Friends from the Far Realm
As the ritual approaches its end, the magic imbued into the orrery components senses the presence of the characters and works to thwart them. Drawing from the franchise's collective subconscious, the ritual manifests the most terrifying figures the characters can think of—their bosses.

At the start of combat, wraithlike Far Realm versions of Omin Dran, Jim Darkmagic, Môrgæn, and Viari appear in front of the planar rift. On initiative count 10 each round, roll on the Far Realm Friends table to determine which of those manifestations vanishes from before the rift, appears suddenly in the thick of combat at a location of your choosing, and lays into the characters.

##### Far Realm Friends
| d4 | Far Realm Friend |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Omin Dran** |
| 2 | **Jim Darkmagic** |
| 3 | **Môrgæn** |
| 4 | **Viari** |

Whichever Far Realm friend appears in combat lingers on the battlefield until initiative count 0, when it vanishes and reappears before the rift again.

Each Far Realm version of an Acquisitions Incorporated character is shaded purple-black, its eyes glowing yellow-gold. A Far Realm friend has all the information about the characters that Head Office knows, and uses that knowledge to be as effective as possible in combat. It uses the appropriate stat block found in *appendix A*, but is neutral evil.

The Far Realm friends cannot be attacked while they wait before the rift—only when they manifest in combat. A Far Realm friend that is killed does not reappear in front of the rift. If that character is subsequently rolled on initiative count 10, no Far Realm friend enters the fight that round.

![[097-04-52.png|right|300]]

#### Reaching the Mesa
As the characters fight, their primary goal will be to reach the top of the sandstone mesa, from which the orrery components and the ritual can be controlled. Characters can use the steps to reach the top, but those steps are warded against intruders (see below). Moreover, the Far Realm friends and the goblins fighting for Splugoth attempt to stop the characters from reaching the top at any cost.

Characters can climb to the top of the promontory, but the weathered sandstone crumbles easily. It takes a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check to reach the top, with climbing gear or a rope providing advantage on the check.

***Twisting Steps and Rune Traps.*** The steps leading up the mesa shift underfoot as a result of Far Realm energy flooding through them, making them difficult terrain. Additionally, each flight of steps is trapped at its midpoint with a magical rune that can be detected only with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check.

Once detected, a rune can be disabled with a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check or Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A character aware of the rune can also attempt a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check to jump safely over it. Moving past the rune otherwise deals 5 (1d10) necrotic damage to a creature and teleports it back to the cavern entrance. The runes remain active until disabled.

***Planar Rift.*** The rift tearing reality apart hovers a few feet above the mesa and pulses with eldritch power. A character who reaches the top can see more details behind the Far Realm friends and the army of goblins visible within the rift, including enormous nightmare creatures with far too many eyes, tentacles, and teeth.

#### Splugoth's Forces
**Splugoth** spends most of the fight mocking the characters, as long as he and his forces have the upper hand. While he controls the orrery components (see below), he uses a bonus action to mutate his goblins or send an eldritch bolt toward a particularly troublesome character. This leaves him free to attack a character who reaches the mesa top. If he does not currently control the orrery, he attempts to regain control.

***Mutating Goblins.*** During the fight, Splugoth's goblin minions start out as a force of ten **goblins**, with their numbers and combat features augmented by the ritual and by Splugoth's control of the orrery components during the fight. See "Ritual Actions" and "Using the Components" below for more information. The goblins spread out, with some hanging back to use their shortbows and others pushing forward into melee.

> ##### Keeping the Battle Exciting
>This final fight is a complex battle with a lot going on. Whether you want to simplify the encounter or dial up the chaos, you can tweak the elements of the fight as needed to create an exciting challenge.
>
>When the ritual summons new goblins, you can have the minimum or maximum number appear, depending on how the characters are doing in the fight. If the characters are so focused on the fight that they don't make the connection between Splugoth's control of the orrery components and the goblins' appearance, have any character trained in Arcana or Religion intuit that controlling the components can shut down the summoning.
>
>Likewise, if Splugoth is brought back to life by the ritual, you can make it clear to the characters that seizing control of the orrery components can prevent this from happening. At your discretion, you might also limit how many times Splugoth can be returned to life in this manner.
>
>During the fight, feel free to reward player ingenuity. Maybe a character attempts to baffle or seduce a Far Realm friend to remove that manifestation from the fight for the round. If it's roleplayed well enough and you think it might be fun, let it work.
>

#### Ritual Actions
The ritual takes its own turn on initiative count 1. If the characters do not control the orrery components, the rift pulses and 2d4 additional **goblins** appear on the battlefield wherever they are most effective.

If **Splugoth** is dead and the characters do not control the orrery components, no goblins are summoned. Instead, the ritual resurrects Splugoth from the dead no matter what condition his body is in, returning him to combat with half his normal hit points.

#### Controlling the Orrery Components
Depending on which components the Six managed to steal in episode 5, and whether the characters gave up other components to Splugoth in the Test Market, the ritual might be fueled by anything from a single component to all six components set into the orrery housing. While the ritual is in progress, the normal magic of the orrery components and housing does not function in the ritual cavern, even if a component is not being used in the ritual. The ritual works regardless of how many components are involved, but adding or removing pieces has an impact on the ritual's magic (see "Adding Components" and "Removing Components" below).

To seize control of the components fueling the ritual, a creature on the top of the mesa can use a bonus action to attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Charisma (Persuasion) check. Splugoth has advantage on this check from his familiarity with the ritual. A successful check wrests control of the components from any creature already controlling them.

A creature that fails in its attempt to control the components triggers a mishap (see "Component Mishaps" below). A creature gaining control is able to use the components as a bonus action (see "Using the Components" below). Once the components are under a creature's control, they remain under that creature's control unless another creature successfully gains control.

![[098-04-54.png|right|300]]

***Adding Components.*** The characters hopefully have at least one more component (the *wheel of stars* given to them by Lottie), and might still possess additional components and the orrery housing. Any character on the top of the mesa who studies the existing components understands that adding a new component to the mix makes it easier to control the ritual. With an action and a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check or Dexterity check using jeweler's tools or thieves' tools, a character adds a component, granting advantage on any character's next check made to control the ritual.

***Removing Components.*** Any of the components fueling the ritual can be removed as an action with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check or Dexterity check using jeweler's tools or thieves' tools. A failed check results in a mishap (see below). Removing a component weakens the ritual, preventing it from summoning any goblins or raising Splugoth on its next turn. This can be done multiple times, until only one component or the orrery housing remains. The final piece can be removed only once the ritual has ended.

#### Using the Components
A creature controlling the orrery components at the heart of the ritual can channel their magic as a bonus action with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Splugoth has advantage on this check. With a success, the controlling creature can choose one of the following options:

- Stop or resume letting the ritual create new goblins (see "Ritual Actions" above).
- Prevent a Far Realm friend from appearing in combat on the following round.
- Give all goblins a mutation of an extra arm. All goblins, including any goblins summoned in the future, can make one additional attack each round. There is no limit to how many extra arms and attacks the goblins can have.
- Decrease the number of arms on all goblins. If the goblins are reduced to zero arms, they cannot attack.
- Mutate the current and future goblins to cause hard plating to appear on their skin, increasing their AC by 1. This increase can be applied multiple times.
- Reverse the above mutation to decrease the goblins' AC by 1 (to a minimum of 1).
- Mutate the goblins to make them lumpy and awkward. Each goblin has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
- Fire a bolt of eldritch energy at a target the controlling creature can see: +8 to hit; 16 (3d10) necrotic damage.

**Splugoth** is not affected by any goblin mutations created by the ritual.

#### Component Mishaps
On any failed check to control the orrery components or to remove a component, the ritual magic flowing through the components is compromised. Roll on the Orrery Mishap table to determine the particulars.

##### Orrery Mishap
| d6 | Mishap |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Each goblin has advantage or disadvantage (50 percent chance) on attack rolls until the end of its next turn. |
| 2 | Each character has advantage or disadvantage (50 percent chance) on attack rolls until the end of their next turn. |
| 3 | Each creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 4 | The ritual targets a random character who is below their hit point maximum. That character regains 2d4 hit points. |
| 5 | A random character grows two extra arms that last until the end of their next turn. While they have these arms, the character has advantage on weapon attack rolls, Strength (Athletics) checks, and Dexterity checks using thieves' tools. |
| 6 | If a Far Realm friend appears in the next round, roll twice to have two appear. |

#### Victory Conditions
As long as Splugoth survives, his connection to the ritual prevents the characters from shutting down its magic, even if they are in control of the orrery components fueling the ritual. If Splugoth is dead and one of the characters controls the orrery components, any character on the top of the mesa can use an action to attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A successful check ends the ritual and saves the world.

If the battle goes poorly for the characters, they can end it at any point by... well, dying. Alternatively, they can retreat and allow Faerûn to be taken over by Far Realm horrors, with either event leaving the fate of the world—and more important, the franchise's future—to be determined by you.

## Conclusion
With the present threat of the Six and the *Orrery of the Wanderer* ended, the characters attain 7th level! Or maybe they're dead! When the fate of the world hangs in the balance, there's always a chance that the heroes will be defeated. In which case, congratulations! You get to start a new campaign—perhaps one in which another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise plays a part in undoing all the mistakes made by those losers from the last franchise.

If the characters were victorious, you can all celebrate a job well done! When the ritual ends, any remaining goblins surrender and beg for mercy (and jobs). Where the rift once opened, a temporary portal now leads back to the Dran & Courtier, which has returned to normal. The freed (and real) Propha Dran thanks the characters for saving the establishment and promises that they will always drink for free while in Red Larch. The members of the "C" Team are likewise indebted to the characters, promising them "just heaps of money" at some time in the future.

#### Orrery of the Wanderer
The final state of the orrery depends on what happened during the ritual. If a significant number of mishaps occurred while the characters and Splugoth fought for control of the components, the orrery might develop even more random properties, or it might lose some of its more potent powers. Either way, it remains a powerful artifact, as detailed in *appendix D*.

In keeping with their promise to Lottie, the characters are obliged to break the orrery up again and scatter its components far and wide. But hey, sometimes adventurers are forgetful. In the end, Omin Dran might have to announce that Head Office is taking charge of the orrery's final fate—though the franchise might certainly be entitled to keep a favorite timepiece. (Or two. Really, who can keep track of these things?) And wherever its pieces end up, the *Orrery of the Wanderer* still has a will of its own, and might spawn additional adventures in the future.

#### The Fate of the Franchise
At an appropriate time, Omin Dran summons the characters to Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office in Waterdeep for a special dinner to thank them for a job well done. The cost of admission is even reduced for the characters and their guests! Whatever reward you think is appropriate can be bestowed upon the characters—including magic or contracts that provide convenient hooks for upcoming adventures.

## Franchise Downtime
Even though "The Orrery of the Wanderer" is at an end, the characters should run downtime activities, both as a celebration of their victory (or to lessen the sting of a partial defeat) and to set the course for the campaign to come. The characters might enjoy changing cosmetic elements of their franchise headquarters to reflect their recent victories, spread their reputation as heroes, cement recent alliances, wrap up open plot hooks, or deal with debts or obligations incurred while saving the world.

#### Friends and Enemies
The characters' heroics might have changed the dynamic between Acquisitions Incorporated and Dran Enterprises, for good or ill. Likewise, a failed ritual deals the Six a severe setback, though Jeff Magic (Splugoth's lich boss) is still out there somewhere. But whether the Six seek immediate revenge or decide to bide their time, things don't stay quiet for long for an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. New rivals, new allies, and new opportunities are sure to make their presence known.

## The Campaign to Come
So what's next? Only you and the players know for sure. You can extend this campaign by allowing the characters to resolve plot hooks left open from previous episodes, or you can build on this adventure with new hooks like the following:

- If the characters were successful in giving relationship advice to Raah the ancient deep crow, it might ask for (or, you know, demand) their assistance to locate and assess potential mates, involving combat or matchmaking as you determine.
- Acquisitions Incorporated has been working to open a franchise in Luskan, and the characters' experience in that city makes them the perfect people to lead the operation. Because they're totally on the best of terms with Dran Enterprises!
- Lottie the lich calls in her favor of not killing the party to hire the characters as troubleshooters. She might need someone to help her out with difficulties in her expansive business operations, or to take care of rivals trying to shoehorn their way into the Greypeaks casino trade. Sure, she's evil. But is she really "evil"? It's a fine line.
- When the characters left the bodies of the dwarf wedding party at the end of *episode 5*, the dwarves immediately understood that they'd been possessed. Through divination magic or incriminating evidence accidentally left in the caravan on the way out of Horn Enclave, Clans Thunderwind and Dhargun know that the characters were the ones responsible. Clan Dhargun might want to hire the characters as operatives for their business operations or engage in commercial agreements with the franchise on the basis of the characters' extraordinarily clever ruse. Clan Thunderwind might want them all dead.
- If the characters didn't defeat him, evil archmage-for-hire Hoobur Gran'Shoop is still out there somewhere. The crazed gnome might be spoiling for revenge. Or he might have forgotten all about the characters, only to accidentally cross their paths again on completely unrelated business. Seriously, he's a little out of it.
- As word of their triumph over the Six spreads, characters returning to Waterdeep for business will be sought out by Otis Adalgrim, who wants them to meet the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr. The characters could be asked to join the Gray Hands, and might have an opportunity to work with Force Grey—an elite group of specialist adventurers drawn from the Gray Hands.
- Rumors begin to spread of purple-and-black versions of famous Acquisitions Incorporated members robbing treasure vaults up and down the Sword Coast. That can't be real, right?

Whatever direction you and the players decide to take your Acquisitions Incorporated campaign in, keep one eye on the balance sheet, the other eye on the competition—and have fun.
