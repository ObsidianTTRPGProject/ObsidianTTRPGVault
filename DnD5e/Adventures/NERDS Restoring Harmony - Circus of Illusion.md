# Restoring Harmony: Circus of Illusions
Welcome to Restoring Harmony, a Dungeons & Dragons adventure series in collaboration with the tasty and colorful world of NERDS.

### Story Summary
Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.

To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more.

But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.

The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!

### Solo Play
Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.

You can also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes on rolls, having monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.

#### TPK: Total Party Kill
In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd *potion of healing* lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.

In the case of an untimely death, you can have a helpful NPC (like Mr. Honeycutt) save the day and revive them, or you can have them forego death saving throws and wake up as they're being dragged someplace unpleasant.

### Adventure Outline
Here is a quick overview of the adventure:

- Green the Bard is approached by Mr. Honeycutt who asks if he will help him find the Emerald Gem. Mr. Honeycutt has tracked the gem to the local circus. He asks Green to infiltrate the circus and retrieve the gem.
- After looking around and investigating all the characters in the circus, Green discovers that **Magnifico** the Magician has the Emerald Gem, which he's hidden in a magic mirror.
- Green must somehow get the gem from the magician and escape.

### Beginning Play
Hand the character sheet (see "Green the Bard," below) to your player and let them familiarize themselves with Green.

All creatures or NPCs that are bolded have stat blocks, which are included at the end of the adventure along with any magic items the characters can earn.

Whenever you're both ready, you can start the session.

## Harmony
The adventure begins in the vibrant and colorful city of Harmony where mysterious "color outages" are beginning to cause a bit of alarm. Being NERDS, the populace of Harmony has an optimistic outlook, and tries to carry on as best they can without being too worried, but the lack of color is concerning to even the most ebullient of NERDS.

When your player is ready, read the following:

>>The city of Harmony has many wonderful features, but it's especially known for one thing: its vibrant color.
>>
>>Recently, however, a strange phenomenon has shaken the citizens of Harmony. In the past few weeks, "color outages" have been reported throughout the city, turning its vibrant streets dull and gray, with very little clue as to what might be causing them. These outages are causing the citizens of Harmony distress and no one's sure what to do.
>>
>>This evening, you're relaxing in your favorite seat in the tavern when a fastidious-looking fellow wearing a suit and horn-rimmed glasses pulls up a chair next to you and looks around nervously before speaking.
>>

The nervous man introduces himself as **Mr. Honeycutt** and says to Green that he needs their help in a matter of utmost importance. If Green is willing to hear Mr. Honeycutt out, he tells Green that he's the current Magister of the Lorekeeper Society—an ancient and secret group dedicated to the defense of Harmony. He believes he knows how to solve the mystery of the color outages and to do this, he needs to recover the Emerald Gem. He believes this gemstone is in the possession of a thief who's somewhere in the Circus of Illusions, an entertainment mainstay of Harmony. Mr. Honeycutt says a bard of Green's talent and charm could easily infiltrate the circus as a performer. If Green is amenable, Mr. Honeycutt gives Green a *potion of healing* and whispers "Watch out for the clowns." He awaits Green's return in the tavern.

## Circus of Illusions
The Circus of Illusions has a massive big top tent in the heart of Harmony. The circus serves as an entertainment venue every weeknight and weekend, featuring magic acts, bard performances, illusory animals, trapeze artists, and more.

In recent weeks, the magic sparkle of the circus has been less sparkly. Even the big top's red stripes appear faded.

### Getting In
Green can choose to pay 1 sp and enter by the main gate or to sneak in. The circus is patrolled by tough-looking clowns wearing colorful costumes, big boots, and red noses. Although the clowns honk horns and act jolly, it's clear they could handle themselves in a fight.

Should anyone try to break into the circus or cause trouble, they run afoul of a couple of these clowns. Avoiding the clowns requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failure, 1d4 **clowns** investigate, ready to pummel and eject any trespassers or ne'er-do-wells. If Green turns to run away, the clowns don't give chase, but shout taunts and honk horns at them.

Charming the clowns takes real skill and can only be done with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

### Encounters at the Circus
Green can meet many colorful characters at the circus. Here are a few of them:

#### Finster
Finster is the **imp** **Magnifico** made a deal with: two years' infernal service for the location of the Emerald Gem. Now the deal is complete, Finster is enjoying changing **Magnifico**'s show to feature them more, so they can live out their dream of being a star.

Finster spends most of their time in **Magnifico**'s tent, in rat form, primping their whiskers and waiting for their nightly show just before midnight. Rarely do they show their true form. Finster is a total narcissist and dreams of one day having **Magnifico** as their assistant in their own magic show.

If Finster feels they can use the Emerald Gem to advance their career or make another deal, they do. Finster has no loyalty to **Magnifico**, other than using him for their own gain. If attacked, Finster shrieks to alert any nearby clowns and turns invisible.

***Impish Deals.*** Finster always has their mind on business and is open to making a deal with Green. Any deal Green makes with Finster is binding until the terms of the deal are fulfilled. If Green breaks the terms, their soul is forfeit.

Finster can offer Green the following, but they drive a hard bargain and require something they consider of equal (or greater) value:

- The location of the Emerald Gem.
- Up to 500 gp worth of art objects, coins, or gems.
- An uncommon magic item.
- Finster's loyal service for a period not exceeding nine years.

#### Magnifico
**Magnifico** is a magician of some skill, but instead of honing his craft further, he craved the escape of easy money and fell into the diabolic clutches of Finster, an opportunistic imp. Finster answered **Magnifico**'s pleas for gold and fame and offered him a deal: two years' service for the location of the Emerald Gem.

**Magnifico** heard of the Emerald Gem through some shady characters he knows. They told him that a Mr. Greystone was willing to pay handsomely for it and **Magnifico** saw this as his ticket out of the small-change circus life. With Finster's help, **Magnifico** found the gem and is now haggling a price with Mr. Greystone to make it worth his two years' infernal servitude.

**Magnifico** isn't a spellcaster, his magic tricks are sleight of hand illusions. If attacked, he cowers and pleads for his life.

#### Mimes
Wandering the circus grounds are mimes (**commoners**) who do all kinds of silent performances such as walking downstairs, opening doors, pulling on ropes, and moving around invisible objects.

At any time, you can have a mime approach Green and pantomime one of the following clues:

- The magician's rat changes into an imp.
- The magician is in trouble.
- The mime saw **Magnifico** holding a magical green gem in his tent.
- **Magnifico** hid the gem in a magic mirror.

You can act out the mime's silent message and have your player guess what the mime is saying. The mime remains stone-faced throughout unless they need to make an exaggerated expression of sadness or another emotion. If you player gets frustrated trying to guess, have the mime shrug, mime sad tears running down their face, and walk away dejectedly.

The mimes never speak, even if compelled by magic. Only a wish spell can break their silence.

Should Green attack a mime, they instantly flee or cower and mime yelling for help.

#### Rubina the Ringmaster
Rubina (a **noble**) is the Circus of Illusions' eccentric and charismatic ringmaster. She's a good-natured bundle of nervous energy and makes sure the circus runs without a hitch, organizing all the entertainment for each day.

***What Rubina Knows.*** As of late, Rubina has grown concerned about her best magician, **Magnifico**. Rubina thinks it's probably just the color outages, which have everyone concerned, but she's heard him arguing with someone in his tent at night.

Rubina doesn't like **Magnifico**'s pet rat, Finster, who **Magnifico** is now featuring in his magic act. She thinks it's a horrid beast and she doesn't like its little smirk and beady eyes.

She doesn't know anything about an emerald, but **Magnifico** did say he was going to be rich and that he'd be leaving the circus in a year.

***Join the Circus.*** At any time, have Rubina approach Green and say the following:

>>You! Bard! You are the answer to my desperate prayers to the gods of entertainment! Come with me!
>>

If Green goes along with the excited ringmaster, Rubina takes Green to the backstage area in the main tent (see area C2, below).

Rubina tells Green that Filippo Fleetfingers, her best musical act, suddenly canceled on account of melancholy over the color outages, and now Green must take his place and entertain the crowd gathered in the big tent. She offers Green up to 10 gp to do a show.

If Green declines, Rubina is beside herself with anxiety and doesn't know how she'll appease the growing ire of the crowd.

If Green accepts, Rubina claps her hands with delight. She asks Green what their stage name is. If your player has a stage name for Green, have Rubina give a big introduction to the crowd using the stage name. If your player can't think of anything, Rubina says not to worry and rushes out on stage to announce the following:

>>And now good people of Harmony! We have a special treat for you tonight. We've searched near and far for this next act, the greatest entertainer in all Harmony, the Verdant Virtuoso, GREEN!
>>

Rubina then ushers Green out on stage.

You player can act out the show or you can have them roll to see how Green does. Have the player choose from the following:

- **Play It Safe** Green plays it safe and gives a solid, but uninspired, performance. If your player does some inspired roleplaying, give them advantage on the check. Green must make a DC 12 Charisma (Performance) check. On a failure, there are some frowning faces and maybe a couple of yawns. Clearly, they weren't expecting much. On a success, the crowd claps politely and then quickly forgets the performance as they wait for the next show.
- **Go for It!** Green attempts the performance of a lifetime with a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check. If your player does some inspired roleplaying, they have advantage on the check, or you could even allow them to succeed outright. On a failure, there are audible groans from the crowd and Rubina manages to crack a supportive smile, but looks crestfallen. On a success, minds are blown, the crowd goes wild, and there are calls for encores. After the show, signatures are demanded. From now on, Green is a celebrity in the city of Harmony. At the end of all the hubbub, Rubina approaches Green with tears in her eyes and gives Green a doss lute. There's an audible gasp from the crowd. "It was sublime. A gift that has lifted my spirits forever," Rubina says.

### Exploring the Circus
The following locations are keyed to the Circus of Illusions map:

![[008.webp|right|300]]

#### C1. Ticket Booth
Beside the main gate is a kiosk where Woody, a magically animated wooden puppet, takes the 1 sp entrance fee, stamps circus-goers' hands with a happy face stamp, and wishes everyone a good time.

Woody's circular face is painted with a big smile, but if anyone tries to get past without paying or causes trouble, the face turns upside down, becoming a big frown and Woody starts calling for clowns to boot the offender. Woody can't fight and, if attacked, is easily reduced to a pile of sticks.

#### C2. Main Tent
Inside this large red tent is a raised wooden stage complete with curtains and a backstage area where actors and other performers can change and prepare for their shows. Benches surround the front of the stage, and behind them are hay bales for audience members to sit on while they enjoy the shows.

At any given time, the stage hosts performances from sword-swallowers, fire-eaters, jugglers, acrobats, musicians, storytellers, and of course, **Magnifico**'s magic act.

#### C3. Magnifico's Tent
Outside this tent, a wooden sign reads "**Magnifico** the Great" in florid, painted letters. Two unshaven **clowns** stand either side of the entrance, one picking his teeth with a broken chicken bone. The clowns stop anyone trying to enter the tent and aren't hesitant to escalate to blows.

***Sneaking In.*** If Green wishes to enter stealthily, they must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check or alert the clowns or Finster (an **imp**), who's inside the tent in rat form.

***Inside the Tent.*** Inside the tent is a small table with two chairs, surrounded by the tools of **Magnifico**'s trade: a top hat, silken handkerchiefs, a cabinet with a false back, a deck of playing cards, a crystal ball, a large mirror in an ornate frame, and a white dove in a cage. If Finster is alive, they're also in the tent in rat form. If Green successfully sneaked in, they surprise Finster, who pretends to be a simple magician's rat, but carefully observes what Green does. You can also throw a wrench in Finster's plans by having Green surprise them while in imp form.

If Finster heard Green coming, they hide and observe Green from the shadows. Spotting Finster while they're hidden requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

If Green appears to be searching for the Emerald Gem, Finster makes themselves known and offers to reveal its location—for a price (see "Impish Deals," above).

***The Emerald Gem.*** **Magnifico** has hidden the Emerald Gem inside the magic mirror in the ornate frame. The mirror is actually a portal to a small 5-footsquare demiplane where the Emerald Gem is kept inside a locked box. If the mirror is touched, its surface ripples like water. Green can step through the mirror's surface into the demiplane where the locked box is. Inside the demiplane, it's totally dark.

***Locked Box.*** This simple ebony box with a magic lock contains the Emerald Gem. The box has AC 12, 10 hit points, a damage threshold of 5, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. (The box's damage threshold means has immunity to all damage unless it takes 5 or more damage, in which case it takes damage as normal. Dealing the box 4 damage or less is considered superficial damage and doesn't reduce the box's hit points.)

The box's lock can be picked with a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

#### C4. Rubina's Tent
If Rubina (a **noble**) is here, she's looking over the upcoming schedule of events for tonight and the next couple of days. There's a desk, two wooden chairs, a small table, and a sofa. So long as they're nice to her, Rubina treats anyone who enters her tent the way a kindly schoolmarm would.

#### C5. Filippo Fleetfinger's Tent
Inside this tent is the morose bard, Filippo (a **noble**). Filippo knows nothing about the Emerald Gem, but he's sad about the color outages and is writing deeply emotional poems about them.

He's noticed that **Magnifico** seems odd lately and he's a bit revolted that **Magnifico**'s once tasteful show now seems dedicated to his awful rat.

Filippo's tent is filled with instruments and littered with pages of his heartfelt poetry.

#### C6. Imelda the Strongwoman's Tent
If **Imelda** is here, she's sipping tea and munching on cakes in between shows. She loves to chat and is always ready to provide a good workout routine to anyone who's interested. **Imelda** knows nothing about the Emerald Gem, but she's fiercely loyal to the circus and Rubina, and will do anything to protect them. Her tent is filled with barbells, iron bars, and trophies from all her past feats of strength.

#### C7. Vendors
These tents are for vendors of tasty treats like kettle corn, caramel apples, and toad-in-the-holes. You can also put in a strength test game where you hit the lever with a hammer to ring the bell. Green must make a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check to ring the bell and win a prize (a stuffed monster of the player's choice).

### Getting the Gem
Once the mimes and Rubina point Green in the direction of **Magnifico**, there are many ways for Green to get the gem. Here are a few ideas:

- Have Green discover the exact whereabouts of the gem by spying on **Magnifico**, who obsessively checks on the gem to make sure his nest egg is safe.
- Have Finster give up the location of the gem for a price.
- Stage an attack by a couple of **clowns** who were hired by Mr. Greystone to steal the gem from **Magnifico**'s tent. If **Magnifico** hears of this, he might come to Green in desperation. Green can enlist the help of **Imelda** to tip the odds in their favor if it comes to a fight.
- Have Green try to get the gem during one of **Magnifico**'s magic acts when he has the magic mirror on stage, resulting in a grand spectacle for the audience.

By the end of it all, Green should get the Emerald Gem and the *doss lute* (if Rubina didn't already give it to them) as thanks for Green's heroics in such a dull and dreary time.

### Completing the Mission
If all goes well, Green meets with Mr. Honeycutt and returns the Emerald Gem to him. You can have Mr. Honeycutt meet Green in a same tavern as at the start of the adventure or in a library within Harmony.

Mr. Honeycutt is overjoyed at the return of the Emerald Gem and wants to know everything about the adventure, scribbling copious notes in his black notebook as he listens.

For their bravery and dedication to the well-being of Harmony, he gives Green a pouch of 20 gp and invites them to join the Lorekeeper Society.
