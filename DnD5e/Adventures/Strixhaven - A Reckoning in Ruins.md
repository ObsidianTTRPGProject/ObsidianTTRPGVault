# A Reckoning in Ruins
As the fourth and final year of the characters' academic career at Strixhaven dawns, the university faces a crisis. In this adventure, the characters come face-to-face with an awful truth: not only does **Murgaxor** Grenshel threaten the safety of everyone on campus, but the university's masters are powerless against the villain. It becomes clear that the characters must drop their studies and stop him at all costs.

## Running This Adventure
Here's what you need to know to run the adventure in this chapter, whether you're running it as part of a campaign or as a standalone adventure.

### Adventure Overview
While the Strixhaven faculty investigate **Murgaxor** Grenshel and his schemes, it becomes clear that the villain has warded himself from their spells so student aid will be needed to defeat him. The characters are called on to help track the villain to his lair and stop his wicked ritual before he siphons the life energy from everyone on campus.

#### A Standalone Adventure
If you're running this chapter's adventure as a standalone, you can summarize **Murgaxor**'s schemes as they have unfolded over the past three years to establish him as a threat the characters must face. A former student who was expelled 200 years ago, he has artificially extended his life and seeks true immortality. He corrupted eldritch balm to cause magical mishaps, schemed to attack students at a Mage Tower game, and manipulated one of Lorehold's deans to harm students. Now his schemes threaten the entire campus.

### Character Advancement
This adventure assumes the characters are 8th level when it begins. The Fourth-Year Level Advancement table summarizes when the characters gain levels during the adventure.

##### Fourth-Year Level Advancement
| Level | Reached When Characters... |
|---|---|
| 9th | Finish exploring the Detention Bog and retrieve the missing crates |
| 10th | Descend into the basement of the Fortress of Caerdoon (before encountering **Murgaxor**) |

### Random Encounters
Use the Fourth-Year Encounters table for random encounters on campus during the adventure.

##### Fourth-Year Encounters
| d10 | Encounter |
|:---:|---|
| 1–4 | 2 **bulettes** |
| 5–6 | 1 **red slaad** and 1 **vrock** that escaped from their classroom bonds |
| 7–8 | 1 **cloaker** that has been hiding in the rafters of an abandoned classroom building |
| 9–10 | 1 **treant** that is angry the campus abuts a natural forest and is initially hostile |

### Student Schedules
Before starting this adventure, have the players choose at least three courses their characters are taking this year, either by coming up with the courses themselves or by rolling on the Fourth-Year Courses table. Inform them that the characters are also enrolled in a required course, Arcane Herbology.

##### Fourth-Year Courses
| d6 | Course | Offered By |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Advanced Applied Magic | General Studies |
| 2 | Advanced Lumimancy | Silverquill |
| 3 | Applied Illusory Arts | Quandrix |

| 6 | Extraplanar Cryptozoology | Witherbloom |

[img/book/SCC/101-06-002.webp](Fourth-year courses are the university's most challenging, and students often employ magical study techniques to get by)

## A Sinister Shadow
Once the characters have cemented their fourth-year Extracurriculars, Jobs, and Relationships decisions as needed, it's time to kick off this adventure.

When the characters arrive for their final year at Strixhaven, the mood is muted. Social spaces are sparsely populated, students chat in whispered tones, and the campus's energy is tense.

Read or paraphrase the following when you're ready to begin the adventure:

>>All of your hard work has come down to this—your fourth and final year as a student of magic at Strixhaven University. But as soon as you arrive on campus, it's clear that something is very wrong.
>>
>>Instead of the usual cheerful bustle, students mill about campus nervously. Here and there, you hear frightened whispers: "I heard his name is **Murgaxor**. I heard he wants to hurt us all."
>>
>>The rumor mill has apparently discovered the grave events that happened last academic term.
>>

At this point, the characters might be waiting on the faculty to discover more about **Murgaxor**'s plans. However, they also might want to take this investigation into their own hands. If they do, run the "*Clue in the Bayou*" section as this adventure's first event.

## A Brief Distraction
While the characters wait to learn more about **Murgaxor**, they discover some of their fellow students engaged in a game at Firejolt Café (see *map 3.2* in *chapter 3*) on the central campus. One of the characters' Friends or Rivals is part of this scene, or you may choose another student from the "*Fellow Students*" section of *chapter 3*.

When you're ready to begin the scene, read or paraphrase the following, altering the text to incorporate the name of the chosen student:

>>The mood on campus might be gloomy, but as you cross the central campus, you see a few of your classmates smiling and gesturing outside Firejolt Café.
>>
>>A familiar face jogs up to you, waving and smiling in relief. "It's so good to see you! Things have been dire around here lately, but some friends are inside about to start playing a game they call Scufflecup. Apparently, they found a box of animated teacups, and they figured out how to control the little buggers! Come on, let's go check it out!"
>>

### Scufflecup
Scufflecup is a game students created after finding a box of teacups in a nearby building's storage room. The students discovered that pouring hot tea into the cups animates them for 10 minutes and causes them to sprout little arms and legs. While animate, a cup uses the **Scufflecup teacup** stat block and does the bidding of whoever animated it.

Characters who enter Firejolt Café find that the fireside lounge (*area F5* on *map 3.2* in *chapter 3*) has been rearranged into a play area for a game of Scufflecup. A student explains the game, which is played on the large table in the lounge's center. The square tabletop is 5 feet on each side. The student who describes how to play is a character's Friend, Rival, or Beloved, although you could choose anyone from the "*Fellow Students*" section in *chapter 3*.

#### Scufflecup Rules
Each participant fills a teacup with hot tea and places it on the table. The participants then roll initiative. At least one Scufflecup participant is a student who isn't a player character.

On each of their turns, a participant can use a bonus action to mentally command their **teacup** either to attack another teacup within range or to try to shove another teacup off the table, using the rules for *shoving* in the *Player's Handbook*. A participant loses the game if their teacup drops to 0 hit points or if their teacup falls off the table.

The participant with the last cup standing wins. The winner receives a purse of donations from the crowd that totals 1,000 gp.

#### Cheering and Heckling
A character who doesn't want to participate in the game can contribute in one of the following ways:

- **Cheer a Participant** A character can encourage one of the game's participants. That participant's teacup gains advantage on its attack rolls.
- **Heckle a Participant** A character can taunt one of the game's participants. That participant's teacup has disadvantage on its attack rolls.

#### Relationship Encounter
If there are students with whom the characters wish to earn Relationship Points, treat the Scufflecup game as a Relationship encounter using the rules in *chapter 3*. Have players note the results of this encounter on their copies of the tracking sheet.

## Arcane Herbology Exam: Vegetation Identification
The rules used for Exams can be found in *chapter 3*. The first Exam for Arcane Herbology takes place shortly after the characters' Scufflecup game in Firejolt Café. Students must identify unlabeled groupings of different plants, lichens, and fungi. Like the course itself, this Exam is conducted in an outdoor lab located in Sedgemoor (see *map 3.6* and its accompanying description in *chapter 3*).

Arcane Herbology covers techniques for using flora in potions, spells, and rituals. The course's professor is Verelda Lang (chaotic neutral **dryad**; see *chapter 7*), an arcano-biologist whom the characters might recall from their first year of instruction.

### Studying Phase
The day before the Exam, the characters can study the course material. A character can use any ability check and skill during the Studying phase.

Once you've asked each player how their character is approaching the Studying phase, resolve that phase by having each character who studies make a DC 20 ability check. Make sure players keep track of their characters' rerolls and apply them during the Testing phase.

### Testing Phase
On the day of the Exam, each character makes two ability checks related to parts of the test:

- **Flora's Arcane Properties** Correctly selecting the properties of samples requires a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) check.
- **Specimen Identification** Recalling the correct names of flora with arcane uses based on sight, smell, and texture requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check.

Have each player note their character's Exam results—how many Student Dice they gained and what skills they used during the test—on their copies of the tracking sheet.

## Clue in the Bayou
At the end of the characters' first Exam in Professor Lang's class, she takes them aside with a grave look on her face. She waits for the other students to leave the room before she addresses the characters:

>>"It is as we feared. **Murgaxor** has been lurking around campus ever since he dared to manipulate Dean Tullus. We still don't know his plans, but we've traced his most recent activity to the Detention Bog.
>>
>>"Our best faculty researchers are digging through Strixhaven's past, but we could use your help searching for clues. I've arranged for you to oversee tomorrow's Detention Bog activities. Needless to say, there's extra credit in it for you if you'll help us once again."
>>

Once the characters have finished talking with Professor Lang, they're free to do as they please until it's time for their shift as detention monitors.

### Detention Monitors
The characters are tasked with mentoring a group of misbehaving students for the day. *Map 6.1* shows the Detention Bog, where this part of the adventure takes place.

The faculty member in charge during detention is a Prismari instructor named Arkin Minexes (lawful good orc **Prismari professor of expression**, except he casts *Tenser's floating disk* instead of *fog cloud*; see *chapter 7*). Instructor Minexes is a recent addition to the faculty who is enthusiastic about learning and team-building.

Earlier in the week, a load of supply crates failed to arrive at a storage area on Witherbloom's campus when a **hydra** attacked the **ruin grinders** (described in *chapter 7*) that were hauling the cargo. The ruin grinders are now malfunctioning and wandering the bayou confusedly. The cargo they hauled is scattered about. Instructor Minexes has tasked the students in detention with retrieving the cargo and bringing it to dry land.

Ten students are scheduled to serve detention during the characters' shift. The characters can easily find out these students' identities beforehand from Professor Lang (see "*Students in Detention*"). The students in detention are already there when the characters arrive for their shift.

[img/book/SCC/102-06-003.idyllic-huts.webp](Idyllic huts dot the bayou surrounding Witherbloom College's campus)

***The Instructor's Secret.*** In reviewing the cargo manifest, Instructor Minexes noted one of the crates contained chemical substances that, unless recovered quickly and stored properly, could become unstable. Unwilling to frighten the students, the instructor keeps this information quiet for now.

Additionally, the instructor is aware of the characters' assignment from Professor Lang. He won't discuss it in earshot of the other students, but if the characters have questions for him, he happily discusses the matter with them in private. Instructor Minexes doesn't have any new information to share about **Murgaxor**.

When the characters arrive, read or paraphrase the following:

>>The smell of putrefaction overwhelms your senses. Ahead, a knot of sullen students and one faculty member stand on a wide wooden pathway over the reeking muck. Grinning, the orc faculty member carries a satchel brimming with scrolls.
>>

A number of students equal to the number of characters are serving detention; you can roll on the Students in Detention table (rerolling any repeated results) to identify them, or you can select ones who suit your game. Instructor Minexes, wants to see everyone learn the value of teamwork during detention. After introducing himself and welcoming everyone to the Detention Bog, he continues:

>>"I am so pleased to have you all here with me today! This is an opportunity for all of us to learn more about ourselves, our fellow students, and the amazing world around us. Today we'll be heading out into the bog to recover some lost supplies and return them to dry land."
>>

Once he finishes his welcome, the instructor pairs each character with a student. He gives each pair of students a *spell scroll* of *Tenser's floating disk*. If no one in detention can read the scroll, the instructor does so for each pair.

Neither Instructor Minexes nor Professor Lang is aware of the hydra attack that caused the supply run to go awry. If the characters inquire how the crates came to be lost, Minexes guesses that the ruin grinders used to haul the supplies malfunctioned. If the characters are amenable, the instructor would appreciate them finding and repairing the ruin grinders, although they don't need to complete that task today.

#### Students in Detention
As detention monitors, each character must spend the rest of the day supervising students who are being punished for their recent misbehavior. Use the Students in Detention table to determine each student and their detention-worthy offense. For more information about these characters, see the "*Fellow Students*" section in *chapter 3*.

Should it become necessary, each student in the table uses the appropriate pledgemage stat block for the student's college (see *chapter 7*).

##### Students in Detention
| d10 | Student (College) | Offense |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | Quentillius A. Melentor III (**Prismari**) | Released **pest mascots** in Widdershins Hall |
| 2 | Rosie Wuzfeddlims (**Lorehold**) | Accidentally triggered a protective spell on a book that caused another student to be banished to an extradimensional space for a short time |
| 3 | Grayson Wildemere (**Silverquill**) | Defaced a rival student's dorm room with magical ink |
| 4 | Bhedum "Rampart" Sooviij (**Lorehold**) | Caused another student to fall through an open, magically hidden trapdoor as a prank |
| 5 | Cadoras Damellawar (**Quandrix**) | Summoned a storm in the dining hall |
| 6 | Aurora Luna Wynterstarr (**Witherbloom**) | Insulted a classmate, refused to apologize, and then insulted the classmate again |
| 7 | Zanther Bowen (**Prismari**) | Reprogrammed a janitorial golem to clean his dorm, with disastrous results |
| 8 | Larine Arneza (**Quandrix**) | Accidentally unleashed a **water weird** during a swim meet |
| 9 | Melwythorne (**Witherbloom**) | Started an unauthorized mascot-breeding program |
| 10 | Tilana Kapule (**Quandrix**) | Sneaked into a temporarily closed portion of the Biblioplex to study |

### The Detention Bog
Located at the outskirts of Sedgemoor on Witherbloom's campus, the Detention Bog reeks of mud and fetid water. Here, students perform useful tasks as punishment for misbehavior—typically, collecting specimens of rare flora and fauna for use in spells, unguents, and potions. It's unpleasant work in an unpleasant place.

#### Searching for Supplies
The characters and students in detention must search for supplies as described below.

***Objective.*** Instructor Minexes directs the students to look for the lost supplies in the area shown on *map 6.1.* The characters and their charges must find the six lost crates in areas *D1*–*D6* on map 6.1 and bring them all to the trail in the map's northwest corner, where Instructor Minexes waits for the students to complete their task. A trail near this rendezvous point leads to a more solid section of Witherbloom's campus.

***Crates.*** Each crate is a sealed, steel box weighing about 150 pounds. Also, each crate has AC 19; 33 hit points; and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. Finally, each is secured with a locking mechanism that requires a successful DC 18 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to unlock. Instructor Minexes carries a master key that unlocks each crate. They all contain spell components. The unstable cargo Instructor Minexes is worried about is in *area D6*; see that area for more information.

***Murgaxor's Influence.*** When the characters examine any of the crates except for the empty crate in *area D5*, they get an unsettling feeling. *Detect magic* reveals latent, sinister magic in the air, as well as a strange sense of magically generated protection.

The characters can deduce that this magical signature belongs to **Murgaxor**, who must have contaminated all of these supplies. If the players don't figure it out on their own, a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that **Murgaxor** has cloaked himself with magical protection, but only from something very specific. It's possible that he has protected himself from the spells of specific spellcasters, although it isn't clear yet who.

***Spell Scrolls.*** The instructor has brought a number of *spell scrolls* of *Tenser's floating disk* equal to twice the number of pairs of students. Either the instructor or a character must read each scroll and cast its spell, which must be used to transport the crates to the northwest corner of the map. If the task takes longer than the duration of two scrolls (2 hours), the characters must figure out how to move the crates on their own.

### Detention Bog Features
The Detention Bog is a muggy place with the following features:

- **Endless Muck** The muddy, stagnant water is 2 feet deep unless otherwise specified and counts as *difficult terrain*. The small islands of land and pathways shown on the map are normal terrain.
- **Poor Visibility** Pervasive mist and drizzle reduce visibility to 30 feet.
- **Teeming Creatures** The bog is filled with animal life, much of it noisy and distracting. Wisdom (Perception) checks are thus made with disadvantage in the bog.

### Detention Bog Locations
The following sections are keyed to map 6.1. The characters begin on the island in the southeast corner of the map.

[img/book/SCC/103-map-6.1-the-detention-bog.webp](Map 6.1: The Detention Bog)[img/book/SCC/map-6.1-the-detention-bog-player.webp](Map 6.1: The Detention Bog (Player Version))
#### D1. The Stickiest Crate

>>A trail of smooth stones just large enough for a person to walk on extends fifty feet between two large landmasses. Just off the center of the trail rests a sealed metal crate in the muck. The crate has a cracked corner seam that oozes a tar-like substance into the filthy water.
>>

Characters who examine the crate from a distance of 5 feet or less can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, discern that the goop leaking from the crate is used to soften planar bonds, thus making summoning easier. The crack can be easily sealed with *mending* or similar magic.

***Crate of Planar Unguent.*** If scraped off the crate into a vial of some sort, the goop can be used to enhance any spell that summons one or more creatures, treating that spell as though it were cast 1 level higher. There's enough unguent leaking off the crate for one use.

#### D2. Angry Trudges

>>A battered crate sits forlornly in the middle of an expanse of mud. Just south of the crate, water burbles from two slimy mounds of dense vegetation, accompanied by muffled rumbling.
>>

Two **brackish trudges** (see *chapter 7*) were drawn to this crate, attracted by the euphoria-inducing herbal concoction within. They are possessive of the crate and attack any who come near it.

***Retrieving the Crate.*** To retrieve the crate, the characters must distract, kill, or incapacitate the brackish trudges. Due to their euphoria, the trudges are only semi-aware of their surroundings, so any Dexterity (Stealth) check made to hide from them has advantage.

[img/book/SCC/104-06-004.detention-bog.webp](When the Detention Bog isn't officially in use, students practice experimental magic here)

#### D3. Lonely Crate

>>At the far end of a broken bridge is a mound of earth barely large enough for one person to stand on. A dented metal crate is partially embedded in the mound.
>>

One of the malfunctioning ruin grinders hurled this crate to its current resting place when the hydra that's now in *area D5* attacked. A character who examines the broken bridge and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check identifies large bite marks in the wood. Once this evidence is found, a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check confirms that a Huge reptile smashed and bit into the wood.

#### D4. Confused Constructs

>>The ground here is spongy and carpeted in soft green grasses. Heavy footfalls and shrieks of grinding metal emanate from the mists. A muddy steel crate rests amid the greenery.
>>

Two **ruin grinders** (see *chapter 7*) wander this island, unable to continue their assigned task of moving cargo. The ruin grinders aren't hostile and attack only in self-defense.

Before it can be used to move cargo again, a ruin grinder needs to be recalibrated. A character within reach of a ruin grinder can use an action to recalibrate it by first succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check and then expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher to reset the ruin grinder's arcane matrix. If the check fails, the ruin grinder shuts down for 24 hours. A recalibrated ruin grinder can carry up to 300 pounds, meaning it can carry two crates at a time to the map's northwest corner, if the characters wish.

***Crate of Incense.*** The crate found here holds incense used in summoning and controlling **air elementals**.

#### D5. Empty Crate
This crate is torn open on one side and filled with muddy water. A character who examines the crate can, with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check, conclude that a big creature with powerful jaws and sharp teeth tore the crate open.

***Enter the Hydra.*** When the characters reach the broken crate, read or paraphrase the following:

>>You hear the sound of snapping trees and guttural, sibilant rasping. A moment later, a cacophonous, multi-throated roar erupts.
>>

The **hydra** enters from the northeast corner of the map, closest to area D6, and starts moving toward the closest noises it can hear.

The dim-witted creature is addled by the magical substances it ingested after attacking the supply train. When the hydra attacks a character, that character can use their reaction to trick the hydra by making a DC 14 Charisma (Deception) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a success, the hydra attacks an object or another creature within 5 feet of its original target (such as the broken crate or a stepping stone). The hydra fights until slain or until there are no creatures it can see or hear.

#### D6. Unstable Crate

>>A steel crate, its surface glowing orange, rests amid a pool of bubbling, hissing water.
>>

This is the crate that concerns Instructor Minexes the most, although the characters are likely unaware of this fact. Several flasks inside the crate broke during the initial hydra attack, and their reagents intermingled. The resulting admixture is in danger of exploding.

A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check can ascertain that the orange glow around the crate is a bad sign, for it suggests the crate's contents might have been damaged in a dangerous way. The crate explodes if it is moved or jostled. If the characters leave the crate alone after they see it, the crate explodes 10 minutes later. When the crate explodes, creatures within 30 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Dealing with the Crate.*** A character who realizes the crate's orange glow is a bad sign can gently shake the crate to rearrange its contents, lessening the explosion to 5 feet. This requires an action and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the crate is covered with at least 10 feet of earth, the damage is halved, and Dexterity saving throws made to resist the effect are made with advantage. If the characters find other creative ways of dealing with the problem that make sense, run with it.

### Developments
When the characters rendezvous with Instructor Minexes in the northwest corner of the bog, he asks if anything about the crates seems strange. Regardless of what the characters report, he shows concern and replies, "I'll report this to the faculty, and we'll put our heads together. It's very likely we'll ask to speak with you all again soon."

***Treasure.*** To further thank the characters, Instructor Minexes allows them to take 5 uses of planar unguent from the crate in *area D1*, assuming that this crate is among those recovered from the bog.

## Advance to 9th Level!
Once the characters have explored the Detention Bog and dealt with the lost supply crates, they advance to 9th level.

## No Time to Lose
The day after the characters' time in the Detention Bog, they're summoned to a meeting with Professor Verelda Lang in the Biblioplex's book gardens. (*Map 3.1* and *chapter 3* provide a full description of the Biblioplex.)

When the characters arrive, Professor Lang says:

>>"It's far more terrible than we thought. The crates you found have been tampered with. We have evidence of a strange magical signature left behind by the culprit. We now believe **Murgaxor** Grenshel is responsible, but he has hidden himself from all known forms of divination magic. It's clear that **Murgaxor** has enacted a protection ritual against all spells and effects cast against him by a faculty member.
>>
>>"It gets worse. **Murgaxor**'s influence over Dean Tullus coerced her into tainting the spell components, food, and drinks of nearly everyone on campus last year. Anyone who came in contact with these are now threatened by the ritual **Murgaxor** is conducting."
>>
>>"Once complete, this ritual will drain the life energy out of everyone affected. Some will die. Others may not. Either way, we believe that the ritual will transfer that energy to **Murgaxor**, making him immortal.
>>
>>"**Murgaxor**'s plan is clear now, and we faculty members are powerless against him. But you're not."
>>

At this point, the characters should realize that they're Strixhaven's only hope to stop this terrible plan. They must face **Murgaxor**—if for no other reason than the characters carry the evil mage's corruption, and they're likely to be gravely injured or die once he completes his ritual.

## But What about Classes?
Professor Lang tells the characters the faculty have agreed that stopping **Murgaxor** is the highest priority. As such, the characters are excused from all further Exams for the rest of the academic year. As long as they make a valiant effort to stop **Murgaxor**, they'll graduate with honors.

Grant the players two Student Dice to use during the remainder of this adventure. These Student Dice can be applied to Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Nature) checks. The players' tracking sheets provide a way to track these dice.

## The Stage Is Set
The characters must find where **Murgaxor** is conducting his life-draining ritual and stop it before its completion. Given that Dean Tullus found *Murgaxor's orb* in the Fortress Badlands just off campus, that's the best place for the characters to start their search for **Murgaxor**'s hideout.

## About Murgaxor
After giving the characters their quest, Professor Lang hands them a file with information the faculty members have collected about **Murgaxor** from university records. Tell the players the following to give them context about this evil spellcaster:

- **Murgaxor** is a bullywug who attended Strixhaven 200 years ago. He was a member of Witherbloom College, though there are no records of him participating in any activities or working on campus.
- [img/book/SCC/105-06-005.murgaxor-grenshel.webp]({@creature Murgaxor|SCC} Grenshel)
- A mean-spirited, egotistical spellcaster, **Murgaxor** was censured repeatedly for disregarding safety protocols, hexing and cursing peers, and using harmful magic while on campus.
- University officials believe **Murgaxor** began his illicit experiments with life-draining magic shortly after he enrolled as a student.
- In his third year, **Murgaxor** was expelled for using life-draining magic when it resulted in another student's death. **Murgaxor** fled before he could be handed over to authorities.
- For a few years after his expulsion, **Murgaxor** was reportedly sighted around the outskirts of campus, specifically in Sedgemoor and the Detention Bog. Authorities believed something about those locations enhanced his magic, but he was never caught. Sightings soon stopped, and no further evidence of **Murgaxor**'s presence was found. Officials assumed he was dead and struck **Murgaxor** from Strixhaven's records, as they considered him a blot on the university's reputation.

## Into the Badlands
Once the characters are ready to venture into the Fortress Badlands, Professor Lang (or another faculty member of your choice) provides directions but warns the characters that this location might be dangerous. Although Dean Tullus didn't run into any problems there, it's likely that **Murgaxor** led her to the orb and removed any threats that might impede his plan to manipulate her.

Indeed, the Fortress Badlands have become a haven for acolytes of **Murgaxor**'s teachings and their thralls. As the faculty suspects, the badlands contain information that can lead the characters to **Murgaxor**'s location. However, the party must first bypass or defeat the current residents.

### Approaching the Badlands
When the characters arrive at the Fortress Badlands, located 20 miles off campus, read or paraphrase the following:

>>Jutting from the cracked earth ahead of you is a network of reddish sandstone hillocks. What little vegetation exists here is blackened and wilting. Three wooden guard towers flank a trail that leads through the hills. Each tower sports a knotted line of glistening rope ascending twenty feet to a broad, winged kite.
>>

Characters approaching from the south get a clear look at the watchtowers (shown on map 6.2). The smaller, central tower has a lone, unmoving sentry. Characters who observe the towers through a spyglass or succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check note that the "sentry" appears to be a mannequin wearing a broad-brimmed sun hat. The kites and sentry are detailed in *area T1*.

A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or (Nature) check reveals that the local vegetation is afflicted by a magical malady. **Murgaxor** has a shrine in his underground lair that corrupts the local flora; defeating **Murgaxor**'s ritual ends this corruption.

### Fortress Badlands Locations
The following locations are keyed to map 6.2.

[img/book/SCC/106-map-6.2-fortress-badlands.webp](Map 6.2: Fortress Badlands)[img/book/SCC/map-6.2-fortress-badlands-player.webp](Map 6.2: Fortress Badlands (Player Version))Unless noted otherwise, entryways and ceilings in the caves are 10 feet high, and the caves are lit by *continual flame* spells cast on wall sconces.

#### T1. Watchtowers
Three of these rickety structures stand in a line running west to east, and each is 20 feet tall.

***Sentry.*** The sentry posted in the smaller, central tower is a **spectator** perched atop a mannequin. The spectator's eye stalks are hidden by a sun hat. The blood mage **Y'demi** summoned the spectator as a guardian after she grew weary of lazy Humanoid lackeys. (For more information about **Y'demi**, see *area U4* of *map 6.3*.)

When alerted to intruders or danger, the spectator detaches from the mannequin while telepathically warning intruders to leave immediately or face annihilation. Creatures that don't comply are attacked.

***Kites.*** The three kites are hideous amalgamations of flesh and bone that serve as aerial defenders. As a bonus action, **Y'demi** or the spectator can make the kites attack intruders. Damaging an inert kite also activates it, as does attacking the line of entrails that attaches the kite to its watchtower. When a kite activates, its entrails detach from the watchtower and slither up into the creature's body. The kite then attacks until destroyed or called off by **Y'demi**. Each kites uses the **peryton** stat block.

#### T2. Collapsing Cave

>>Gentle, white light emanates from within the mouth of this cave. The mouth is fifteen feet across and ten feet high, but the cave narrows as it deepens.
>>

The northeastern alcove of this cave holds **Murgaxor**'s old collection of brined and preserved lab specimens from his decades researching life and death. If any creature other than **Murgaxor** moves more than 10 feet into the cave, a defensive sigil detonates on the ceiling, causing a cave-in. A character who moves 5 feet into the cave can detect this sigil with a successful DC 17 Perception (Wisdom) check, and they can disable it with a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Failing the check by 5 or more causes the sigil to detonate.

If the sigil detonates, each creature in the cave must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained by debris. On a successful saving throw, they take half as much damage and aren't knocked prone or restrained. A creature can use an action to try to pull itself or another creature it can reach out of the debris, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature freed from the debris is no longer restrained by it. The cave-in destroys **Murgaxor**'s collection of lab specimens.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the northernmost wall of the cave and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend in with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door swings into a small, secret chamber.

***Treasure.*** The secret chamber is unlit and holds **Murgaxor**'s stash of easily transportable valuables, which he keeps here in case he has to flee the badlands in a hurry. These valuables are in plain view along the north wall:

- A *ring of mind shielding* in a metal jewelry box (the ring holds the soul of a troll mage named Kallanthus, who is afraid to leave the ring and travel to the afterlife)
- A *cloak of elvenkind* crafted from woven vines

This winding network of tunnels and alcoves holds **Murgaxor**'s collection of books, scrolls, and curios, which are heaped on shelves and in niches along the cave walls. This area has four entry points, each with its own collection of items.

The **shadow demons** in *area T3E* investigate any loud noises coming from the neighboring areas.

#### T3A. Southeast Entrance

>>The floor of this open cave is strewn with the bones of small birds, reptiles, and wild dogs.
>>

The animal bones are the remains of **Murgaxor**'s and **Y'demi**'s past meals.

#### T3B. Southwest Entrance

>>Books and scroll cases are tucked in nooks along the west wall of this open cave. Many of the book spines and scroll cases bear the Strixhaven star.
>>

Items bearing the Strixhaven star were stolen from the university. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check while searching the collection finds several annotated books about the Caerdoon region, located a few miles from the badlands. The annotations, sloppily written in Common, deal with locating sites of large battles and how best to explore those locations.

***Treasure.*** Characters who spend at least 10 minutes searching this area find a *spell scroll* of *fear* and a *spell scroll* of *false life*.

#### T3C. Empty Chamber
This empty chamber has short tunnels connecting it to area T3B to the south, area T3D to the north, and area T3E to the east.

#### T3D. Northwest Entrance

>>This open cave and its walls hold racks of weapons and spellcasting foci, including orbs, animal fetishes, carved stones, and the like.
>>

The spellcasting foci stored here aren't magical, but one is an obsidian orb cut in the motif of an ancient troll civilization. This orb would fetch 300 gp from a collector.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the east wall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend in with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door opens into a smaller secret room.

***Treasure.*** The secret room is unlit and once held **Murgaxor**'s most prized arcane texts, most of which went with him to the Ruins of Caerdoon when he recently relocated there. The remaining texts—of which there are twelve stacked in two piles of six—are still valuable. The university would pay 500 gp for their safe return.

#### T3E. East Entrance

>>Ineptly painted portraits of **Murgaxor** hang on the walls of this shadowy cave. Stairs cut into the north wall lead down to a lower level.
>>

Four **shadow demons** hide in the shadows of this cave. They attack visitors who aren't accompanied by **Murgaxor** or **Y'demi**. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher spot the shadow demons before they attack and aren't surprised by them.

The stairs in the north wall lead down to areas U1 through U4, detailed later in the "*Underground Cave*" section.

#### T4. Supply Room

>>A jumbled pile of supplies lies on the floor of this open cave and spills into a narrow hallway beyond.
>>

This cave holds what remains of the supplies **Murgaxor** used to explore the Ruins of Caerdoon, located just a few miles away. A character who spends at least 1 hour sifting through the tools can assemble one set of *mason's tools*, two *explorer's packs*, one *dungeoneer's pack*, and one *scholar's pack*.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the northernmost end of the cave and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door swings into a small chamber.

***Secret Room.*** **Murgaxor** kept alchemical supplies in this unlit secret chamber. Most of the supplies have been removed except for two *flasks of acid* and three *flasks of alchemist's fire*.

#### T5. Lab

>>The pungent odors of sweet potpourri and chemical preservatives waft from this cave. Carved into the walls are shelves bearing specimen jars, notebooks, and containers of herbs and alchemical reagents. In the middle of the cave rests a smooth stone slab covered in a rusty stain.
>>

**Murgaxor** conducted horrific experiments here. Primarily, he worked on transferring life from one creature to another.

A character who spends at least 30 minutes skimming the notebooks can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, piecing together the nature of **Murgaxor**'s work on a success. What **Murgaxor** describes in his notebooks lines up with the maladies that plagued Strixhaven last year.

Harmless samples of flesh are stored here in jars. However, **Murgaxor**'s experiments created a few unfortunate Undead, which are described below.

***Box of Helping Hands.*** This unmarked, 2-foot-by-3-foot metal box has a simple latch keeping it closed. The box contains a dozen **crawling claws**. If the lid is opened, the crawling claws quickly skitter out. A character who immediately tries to close the lid can make a DC 15 Dexterity check; if the check succeeds, 1d6 crawling claws escape before the lid shuts; the others are trapped in the box, unable to escape until it is opened again.

On their first turn in combat, crawling claws that escaped from the box scurry about the cave, knocking over jars of chemical supplies and creating a chemical mixture that fills the cave with noxious gas for 1 minute. When a creature enters the gas-filled cave for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to the gas, as are the crawling claws. A *gust of wind* spell or similar magic disperses the gas.

***Skull in a Jug.*** Vargas Kancia was a Prismari student; he was researching elemental nodes in the badlands when he was abducted by **Murgaxor**, whose experiments transformed Vargas into a **flameskull**. Vargas rests in an unsealed, straight-sided glass jar filled with clear goo. If another creature comes within 5 feet of the jug, Vargas awakens, flies out of the jug covered in goo, and erupts in emerald flames. Vargas is confused and enraged, attacking whichever creature awakened him.

A character can use an action to try to persuade Vargas to cease his attacks, doing so with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Once he is talked down, Vargas realizes his anger is unjustified, apologizes for his outburst, and offers to help the characters for the remainder of the adventure. Vargas's priorities are to see **Murgaxor** brought to justice and to resume his studies at Strixhaven.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the northwest wall of the cave and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door opens into a cramped secret chamber.

***Treasure.*** The secret chamber is unlit and contains a set of *alchemist's supplies* along with two *potions of healing (greater)* and one *potion of poison*.

[img/book/SCC/107-06-006.lorehold-expeditions.webp](Lorehold expeditions into the badlands sometimes awaken more than mere memories)

#### T6. Mushroom Cave
Characters who approach this cave without first exploring area T7 attract the attention of the **gorgon** lairing there, causing the creature to charge out of area T7 and attack them.

>>The stench of decay wafts from this unlit cave. Inside, rows of wooden planters mounted on the walls hold a variety of fungi. A large purple mushroom grows in the northwest corner.
>>

The large, purple mushroom growing in the northwest corner is a **shrieker**, which commences shrieking when any creature that's not **Murgaxor** or **Y'demi** approaches more than 10 feet inside the cave. The shriek is loud enough to alert the **spectator** in *area T1*, the **shadow demons** in *area T3E*, and the **gorgon** in *area T7*.

The fungi here are used in **Murgaxor**'s alchemical concoctions and poisons. Creatures foolish enough to eat the fungi must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the north wall of the cave and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door pulls open to reveal an unlit room containing a pair of hostile **black puddings**. The puddings spill out and attack as soon as the secret door is opened. Unless the characters were able to see into the room (with the aid of a *clairvoyance* spell or similar magic) before opening the door, they are surprised at the start of this encounter.

#### T7. Gorgon's Cave
A **gorgon** occupies this otherwise empty cave. Characters who come into view of the grumpy gorgon provoke its anger, causing it to attack them.

### Underground Cave
The underground cave was **Murgaxor**'s (and is now **Y'demi**'s) private chambers. It contains space for rituals, research, and quiet contemplation. It is depicted on map 6.3 and has the following features:

[img/book/SCC/108-map-6.3-underground-cave.webp](Map 6.3: Underground Cave)[img/book/SCC/map-6.3-underground-cave-player.webp](Map 6.3: Underground Cave (Player Version))
- **Bare Stone** This cave looks naturally formed, but the stone has been shaped and smoothed by magic. The cave walls have shelves built into them.
- **Ceilings** The ceilings are 10 feet high and gently curved and smoothed like the walls.
- **Light** All areas are lit by *continual flame* spells cast on wall sconces.
- **Scry-Proof** Any attempt to magically scry on a creature, object, or location within the underground cave fails automatically.

#### U1. Meditation Alcove

>>Just after a three-way intersection, the tunnel widens into an alcove. Gooey mud covers the alcove's floor, and the air is oppressively muggy.
>>

**Murgaxor** came here to meditate and used magic to transform this alcove into a humid bog suited to his tastes.

***Protective Muck.*** Any creature that bathes in the mud for 1 minute gains 1d4 + 1 *temporary hit points* for 1 hour. If any temporary hit points remain when the effect expires, the affected creature takes 5 necrotic damage.

#### U2. Ritual Area

>>Ritual circles drawn in fine, chalky powder cover the floor. Notebooks, scrolls, and brass braziers sit on shelves carved into the walls.
>>

**Murgaxor** used this area to perfect his rituals. Characters who spend 5 minutes or more reading the notebooks and who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check piece together that **Murgaxor** is conducting his life-draining ritual in the basement of the Ruins of Caerdoon, which is just a few miles to the north of the Fortress Badlands. They also learn that the ritual will be complete in about a week.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the area and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door opens into a hallway that ends at another secret door, beyond which is area U4. From inside the hallway, characters can spot either secret door without having to make a check.

#### U3. Guard Chamber

>>Two mud-caked, human-sized creatures stand inert in front of the northern exit to this chamber. Crude, articulated skulls of badlands wolves are attached to their heads. Both guards reek of death.
>>

**Y'demi** created these horrifying Undead to guard her sleeping area. Both use the **ghast** stat block and start combat with 5 *temporary hit points*, having recently bathed in area U1. The creatures attack without mercy. Combat here alerts **Y'demi** in area U4, and she investigates.

#### U4. Living Area

>>A copper basin on a wrought-iron stand rests on the floor in the middle of this cave. A pool of smelly water fills the cave's northwest corner.
>>

**Murgaxor** lived here before decamping to the Ruins of Caerdoon for his ritual. **Y'demi** (neutral evil human **Oriq blood mage**; see *chapter 7*) resides here now, waiting for **Murgaxor**'s imminent call to join him.

***Copper Basin.*** The copper basin contains a gallon of fresh blood. So long as she can see the basin and there's a gallon or more of blood in it, **Y'demi** can use the following bonus action:

>***Sanguine Tentacles (1/Day).*** The blood in the copper basin disappears as tentacles of congealed blood fill a 10-foot cube centered at a point on the ground that **Y'demi** can see within 15 feet of her. The effect lasts for 1 minute, during which time that area is *difficult terrain*. Any creature entering that area for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the tentacles. A creature that starts its turn restrained by the tentacles takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make either a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check or a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, ending the restrained condition on itself on a success.

***Roleplaying Y'demi.*** **Y'demi** works with **Murgaxor** because she's fascinated with his magic, but she isn't willing to die for him.

**Y'demi** fights until she loses half or more of her hit points, then makes a cutting remark as she tries to escape. **Y'demi** is patient and cunning. If captured, she tells the students about **Murgaxor**'s setup in Caerdoon, if she thinks doing so will help keep her alive. She informs the characters that **Murgaxor**'s ritual will take about a week to complete. She won't help the party thwart the ritual, but if a character succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma (Intimidation) check, she gives short, honest answers to the characters' questions.

***Secret Door.*** A character who searches the southeast wall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a door disguised to blend with the surrounding stone. This 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall stone door opens to a hallway that ends at another secret door, beyond which is *area U2*. From inside the hallway, characters can spot either secret door without having to make a check.

***Smelly Pool of Water.*** The smelly water in the northwest pool is drinkable.

### Developments
The information in *areas T5*, *U2*, and *U4* gives a clear picture of the ritual **Murgaxor** is conducting, where he's conducting it, and when it will be completed. The characters can rush to confront **Murgaxor** in the Ruins of Caerdoon right away. However, since they have some time before the ritual finishes, encourage them to return to campus to make any final preparations—not to mention have one final visit with their Friends, Rivals, and Beloveds—before heading into this adventure's final areas.

## This Is Surreal, Isn't It?
If the characters return to campus before heading to the Ruins of Caerdoon, a fellow student approaches them before they leave the campus and embark on their next journey. This student should be a character's Friend, Rival, or Beloved.

The student looks at the characters with trepidation before giving the character they know best a hug, a pat on the shoulder, or another indication of affection. The student tells the characters they have something to show them and leads the party into Bow's End Tavern (*map 3.3* in *chapter 3* shows the building's layout).

Once you're ready to begin this event, read or paraphrase the following:

>>Inside the normally raucous Bow's End Tavern, the mood is somber. Your peers are here, and they've heard about your dire mission to head into the Ruins of Caerdoon. They have organized a fete, or something like it, to send you off. Banners that read "We Believe in You!" and "Heroes of Strixhaven!" hang all about the tavern. Friends tearfully wish you luck. Everyone knows what's at stake, and they're all counting on you.
>>

In addition to the characters' Friends, Rivals, and Beloveds, this gathering includes faculty members such as Professor Verelda Lang, Instructor Arkin Minexes, Professor Brenneth Blackstone, Professor Mavinda Sharpbeak, and others at your discretion.

### Relationships: Before We Go
[img/book/SCC/109-06-007.adventurers-never-know.webp](Adventurers never know what lurks within an ancient ruin)

This scene is the final opportunity for the characters to interact with their fellow students on campus before this adventure's climax and conclusion. As such, this Relationship encounter is more free-form than others.

Since this is the last such encounter before the adventure's finale, this scene should be of personal importance to each character. If a player wishes to cement a Beloved Relationship when they normally couldn't or gain a Friend even if they don't have enough Relationship Points, allow them to do so to reflect the poignant nature of this moment.

For example, a character who wishes to have a final moment with a deeply romantic Beloved might sneak up onto the roof of the Biblioplex to have a heart-to-heart under the stars. Another character might want to share a deeply personal story from their childhood with their Friend or Beloved before giving that individual a treasured keepsake.

#### Time to Stop Murgaxor!
Once the characters are ready to embark on their mission to stop **Murgaxor** once and for all, they can head through the badlands again and into the Ruins of Caerdoon.

## Ruins of Caerdoon
**Murgaxor** learned that his ritual must take place in a location where a massacre has occurred. The Ruins of Caerdoon is the perfect location since an ancient battle once took place here. By harnessing the site's latent necromantic energy, **Murgaxor** plans to draw life energy from the scholars at Strixhaven into his own body. When the ritual is complete, he'll become immortal.

Two hundred years of preparation have led **Murgaxor** to this moment, and he's taking no chances in seeing it through. Aside from his own formidable magical abilities, **Murgaxor** has enlisted the Oriq as allies—and even a **daemogoth**. (See *chapter 7* for more information about the *Oriq* and *daemogoths*.)

### Regional Effects
**Murgaxor**'s ritual wreaks havoc on the equilibrium of life and death, creating the following regional effects in the Ruins of Caerdoon and the fortress, which is detailed in a later section. These effects end 1d6 days after the ritual ends or is interrupted:

- **Clinging to Life** Death saving throws are made with advantage.
- **Grievous Wounds** Any creature that scores a critical hit rolls one additional damage die to determine damage.
- **Withered Vegetation** Vegetation within 1 mile of the fortress appears withered and sickly.

### Features of the Ruins
Although members of Lorehold College have been known to visit the Ruins of Caerdoon on archaeology expeditions, the area is far from safe or well explored. Most of the fortress has fallen to ruin, but potent magic and sturdy construction have left enough stone standing to make it defensible.

Notable features are summarized below:

- **Desecrated Earth** The area is awash in necrotic energy. Undead here have advantage on saving throws against being turned.
- **Fortress Walls** The fortress looks like a blast of energy blew the top two-thirds of it away. The walls are roughly 10 feet high and 2 feet thick unless otherwise specified.
- **Illumination** No light sources are present in the ruins, which are illuminated by sunlight during the day and moonlight at night.
- **Trees** The trees here are gnarled and have discolored leaves.

### Ruins Locations
The following areas are keyed to map 6.4.

[img/book/SCC/110-map-6.4-ruins-of-caerdoon.webp](Map 6.4: Ruins of Caerdoon)[img/book/SCC/map-6.4-ruins-of-caerdoon-player.webp](Map 6.4: Ruins of Caerdoon (Player Version))
#### N1. Haunted Watchtower
The fortress used to have multiple watchtowers covering all approaches but now has only one battered tower near the south road. A **wraith**—the tormented remnant of a long-dead garrison commander—stands watch. When it detects visitors, the wraith lets out a shriek that puts the ruins on alert and activates the necromantic barrier described in area N2.

A character who wants to sneak past the watchtower or climb its ladder undetected must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check. If multiple party members attempt the same task, have them make a group check instead.

#### N2. Wailing Moat

>>Hundreds of voices wail in rage and frustration from a moat of viscid slime that surrounds the crumbling ruins. At the fortress's southern tip, a shattered bridge droops over the sludge, a ten-foot-wide hole smashed through its center.
>>

Hundreds of soldiers died in ages past assaulting the walls of Caerdoon, and their moss-covered bones rest at the bottom of the fortress's moat.

***Shield of the Fallen.*** When a creature not approved by **Murgaxor** moves within 10 feet of the moat, a 40-foot-high, 1-inch-thick dome of opaque necrotic energy erupts from the middle of the moat to enclose the ruined fortress (*area N6*).

When the dome appears, read the following:

>>A wall of writhing darkness climbs forty feet in the air, forming an opaque dome around the ruins.
>>

Any creature in or above the moat when the dome appears must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creature chooses if it's inside or outside the dome. The dome deals 22 (5d8) necrotic damage to any creature that touches it. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.

Nothing can physically pass through the dome unless certain conditions are met, as explained below. However, the dome doesn't block ethereal creatures or prevent the use of spells such as *dimension door* or *teleport*.

The dome is impervious to most damage. However, a character who examines the dome and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check ascertains that it's possible to make a temporary hole in the dome by dealing radiant damage to it, and that a skilled arcanist can manipulate the dome's magical harmonics to make it susceptible to other damage types, as well (as described below).

Dealing at least 25 radiant damage to the dome with an attack or a spell creates a 10-foot-diameter hole in it. Appearing at the point where the attack or spell made first contact with the dome, this hole remains open for 1 minute.

A character can try to manipulate the dome's arcane harmonics by using an action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, the character can switch the requisite damage type from radiant to another type chosen from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, piercing, slashing, or thunder. The change in requisite damage type lasts until the end of the character's next turn.

#### N3. Wreckage

>>The twisted wreckage of siege weapons litters the area. Ballistas, catapults, and even a trebuchet lie together in a tangled pile.
>>

The broken siege weapons form a 10-foot-high, 40-foot-long barricade.

***Catapult Munition.*** A character who searches the area and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a catapult munition roughly the size and weight of a cannonball amid the wreckage. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the munition is powerful enough to damage the Shield of the Fallen in area N2, provided the dome's magical harmonics are altered so that the dome becomes susceptible to fire damage.

The munition can be thrown up to 30 feet and explodes on impact. Any creature within a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, each object in that area that isn't being worn or carried takes 35 (10d6) fire damage.

[img/book/SCC/111-06-008.the-ruins-near-strixhaven.webp](The ruins near Strixhaven are watched over by strange creatures)

#### N4. Supply Train

>>The pulverized remains of a military supply train are heaped alongside the trail leading to the fortress.
>>

The wreckage of a supply train forms a 5-foot-high, 25-foot-long barrier. Climbing atop the wreckage requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### N5. Siege Towers

>>The remains of two mighty siege towers lie flattened near the moat's edge. The scorch marks of battle can be seen on the wood and steel even after hundreds of years.
>>

The area covered by wreckage is *difficult terrain*.

Six **wights** crawl out of the wreckage if the characters move or rummage through it. When the wights appear, read:

>>A half dozen long-dead soldiers crawl out from underneath the wreckage and get to their feet, their faces grim with determination as they unsheathe their rusty swords.
>>

The wights take their orders from the wraith in *area N1*, and the wraith has instructed the wights to attack trespassers on sight. However, a character who calls for a cessation of hostilities can, with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convince the wights not to attack on their next turn and answer a few questions instead. This ploy works once, after which further calls for peace fall on deaf ears. Questions the wights can answer include the following:

***Where is Murgaxor now.*** "Probably in the basement under the ruins. He spends most of his time there." (The wights point toward area N6.)

***Have you seen Murgaxor recently.*** "When last we saw him, he was scribing magical glyphs in the ruins." (The wights are referring to the *glyphs of warding* in area N6.)

***Why are you on Murgaxor's side.*** "He has achieved mastery over life and death. There is no better lord to command this ruined fortress."

***What do you know about the ruined fortress.*** "We died defending it, and we defend it still."

***Will you help defeat Murgaxor.*** "No."

#### N6. Fortress
[img/book/SCC/112-06-009.khelvor.webp](Khelvor the daemogoth eagerly anticipates the suffering that will occur when {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s ritual is complete)

>>Little remains of the once-proud fortress. Only ten feet or so of the walls remain, worn and bleached by time and weather.
>>

Khelvor the **daemogoth** (see *chapter 7*) patrols the fortress, eager to defend **Murgaxor** in exchange for all the sweet suffering that's about to occur. He is a cunning, self-serving sadist.

***Glyphs of Warding.*** In each 5-foot square marked X on *map 6.4* is a *glyph of warding* placed by **Murgaxor**. Finding each glyph requires a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the wights in area N5 warned the characters about the glyphs, checks made to find them have advantage.

Once a glyph is found, a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check disables it. Otherwise, the glyph triggers the first time a creature enters the 5-foot square, activating a *hypnotic pattern* spell (save DC 16) centered on the glyph.

***Necrotic Locus.*** In the middle of the fortress is a disgusting orb of bone, flesh, and necrotic energy. The first time a character sees it, read:

>>Pained eyes bulge from a 5-foot-diameter sphere of glistening muscle, ashen skin, and yellowed bone. Oily vapor issues from six mouths on the surface of the sphere, which sits pulsing on the ground.
>>

A character who examines the sphere and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check ascertains that it powers the dome around the ruins (see *area N2*), and that its haphazard construction makes it susceptible to having its innards torn out or its magic destabilized.

The Locus is a Medium object with AC 15; 50 hit points; a damage threshold of 15; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. The Locus can't be moved, but it can be damaged in the following special ways:

- **Rip Out Its Guts** A character can reach inside the Locus through one of its mouths and try to rip out its innards with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check fails, the character is unsuccessful and takes 10 necrotic damage. If the check succeeds, the character takes 5 necrotic damage and deals 22 (4d10) slashing damage to the Locus, ignoring its damage threshold and resistance to slashing damage.
- **Undo It with Magic** A character within 5 feet of the Locus can use an action to try to overload it using an incantation taught in school. The character concludes the incantation by making an Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check fails, the character takes 5 necrotic damage. If the check succeeds, the Locus takes 22 (4d10) force damage, ignoring its damage threshold.

Once the Locus is destroyed, the dome vanishes.

### What Happens Next?
Once the characters have defeated **Murgaxor**'s guardians, they might be tempted to run into the fortress's basement immediately. Taking a short rest beforehand might be the wiser course of action, but doing so kills the narrative momentum and might not feel right to your players.

To give the characters a better chance of success, provide them with the benefits of a short rest without making them wait an hour. Below are some suggestions for handling this without pulling the party out of the moment:

- The party comes together, dramatic speeches are given, and the power of friendship refreshes everyone.
- When the Necrotic Locus is destroyed, a backlash of life-giving energy revitalizes the party.

## Advance to 10th Level!
Each character advances to 10th level before the party descends into the *basement* of the Fortress of Caerdoon.

## Confronting Murgaxor
Completing the life-draining ritual occupies all of **Murgaxor**'s attention. This distraction coupled with his unbridled hubris give the characters the edge they need to defeat him once and for all.

## Ritual Stones
**Murgaxor**'s ritual can't be completed without five ritual stones, which circle **Murgaxor** while he performs the ritual. Without the stones, he can't manipulate the forces of life and death and would be overwhelmed by their power. See *area M6* for more information about these stones.

[img/book/SCC/113-06-010.the-ruins-of-caerdoon-hold.webp](The Ruins of Caerdoon hold many remnants of ancient warfare)

## Basement Features
The Fortress of Caerdoon's basement has the following features:

- **Walls** The walls are damp and made of smooth, worked stone.
- **Ceilings** The ceilings throughout this level are 10 feet high.
- **Doors** The doors are constructed of heavy wood. Each sports a simple but sturdy drop-down latch on the outside unless otherwise specified. Latched doors require a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check to batter open from the inside.
- **Floors** The floors are worked stone and covered with small puddles of water.
- **Illumination** Sconces hold torches that have *continual flame* spells cast on them. The sconces are spaced at 20-foot intervals along the walls.

## Locations in the Basement
The following locations are keyed to map 6.5.

[img/book/SCC/114-map-6.5-fortress-of-caerdoon-basement.webp](Map 6.5: Fortress of Caerdoon Basement)[img/book/SCC/map-6.5-fortress-of-caerdoon-basement-player.webp](Map 6.5: Caerdoon Basement (Player Version))
### M1. Central Chamber

>>Torches illuminate a spacious chamber that has crates and boxes stashed in its corners. Five stout, wooden doors line the chamber's south wall. Soggy texts and scrolls lie in puddles on the floor. To the north, you hear an eerie chant made up of guttural croaks.
>>

**Murgaxor** is the source of the chant. If the characters make any loud noises here, **Murgaxor** notices their presence, although he remains in *area M6*.

The soggy books and blank scrolls lying in puddles on the floor were used by **Murgaxor** to prepare for his ritual; they no longer have any value.

***Crates.*** A character who spends 1 minute searching the crates can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check, find one of the following useful concoctions. Only one of each concoction can be found here:

***Alchemist's Doom.*** Stored in a flask, this concoction is alchemist's fire, except it deals 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of the target's turns.

***Murgaxor's Elixir of Life.*** Whoever drinks this concoction gains advantage on death saving throws for 24 hours.

### M2. Munition Storage
These rooms were once used to store volatile munitions. A character who spends 1 minute searching one of these rooms can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, finding one of the following items on a success. No more than two of each item can be found:

- **Bomb** See "*Explosives*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more information on *bombs*.

***Catapult Munition.*** This device looks like a cannonball and weighs as much as one. It functions like the catapult munition found in *area N3*.

### M3. Broken Elevator
This room is actually the top of a shaft that once connected the fortress basement to a tunnel network below the basement. An elevator hoist is still attached to the ceiling and has frayed ropes dangling from it. Twenty feet below the door, the shaft is impassibly choked with rubble. Characters can use the dangling ropes to lower themselves down to the rubble. A search of the rubble yields nothing of value, and the elevator platform itself is buried under tons of debris.

### M4. Ruined Storage
Grain and other dry goods used to be stored here, but **Murgaxor** has consumed them, leaving the room bare except for some empty sacks.

### M5. Armory
These rooms held weapons and armor for the fort's defenders. What's left is described below.

***North Room.*** This room holds five suits of *chain mail* and five suits of *splint armor*.

***Center Room.*** This room holds six *spears*, three *mauls*, and three *glaives*. The weapons are battered but functional.

***South Room.*** This room holds five *heavy crossbows* and three dozen *bolts*.

### M6. Immortality Ritual

>>Globules of swamp water float in the air, their surfaces rippling. A bullywug, sitting hunched with legs crossed, is partially hidden within a cocoon made of thin, tightly woven strands of mud. Five bright stones buzz around this hunched figure like flies, and a runic circle crackles with eldritch power on the floor below the figure.
>>

The bipedal figure is **Murgaxor**, who uses the **Oriq blood mage** stat block in *chapter 7* and has access to lair actions (see "**Murgaxor**'s Lair Actions" below), which he can use anywhere in the Ruins of Caerdoon. Whirling around him are five stones he needs to complete his life-draining ritual (see "**Murgaxor** and the Ritual Stones" below). While performing the ritual, **Murgaxor** can't move or take actions, bonus actions, or reactions. However, he can take lair actions.

***Barrier.*** **Murgaxor** is surrounded by a barrier of arcane energy resembling a cocoon of writhing mud. While surrounded by this barrier, **Murgaxor** and the stones encircling him can't be targeted by attacks or spells. The barrier has AC 14; 200 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The barrier can't be circumvented by teleportation magic, which fizzles if anyone tries to teleport past it.

***Murgaxor and the Ritual Stones.*** Once the barrier is destroyed, characters can attack **Murgaxor** and the five ritual stones circling him. Each stone is an 8-inch-long cylindrical opal covered with delicate golden runes. It has AC 18, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing **Murgaxor** to 0 hit points or destroying all five ritual stones ends the ritual before it can be completed (see "*Stopping the Ritual*" below).

***Murgaxor's Lair Actions.*** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), **Murgaxor** can take one of the following lair actions; after he does so, he can't use that action again until he finishes a long rest:

- **Clay Behemoth** A **clay golem** erupts from the floor in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The golem obeys **Murgaxor**'s commands, takes its turns on initiative count 10 (losing initiative ties), fights until destroyed, and reverts to a mound of inanimate clay after 1 hour.
- **Earthen Fist** A Medium fist made of packed earth rises from the floor in an unoccupied space that **Murgaxor** can see within 30 feet of him. The fist then attacks one creature of his choice that is within 5 feet of the fist. The fist has a +11 bonus to hit, and on a hit, the target takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage and is grappled (escape DC 15). The fist disappears if the attack roll misses or if the grapple ends. When the fist disappears, this lair action recharges, allowing **Murgaxor** to use it again.
- **Necrotic Burst** Tendrils of necrotic energy erupt from the ritual circle and lash out at any number of creatures **Murgaxor** can see within 15 feet of the circle. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or it takes 5 (1d10) necrotic damage and can't regain hit points until the start of its next turn.
- **Summon Mephits** **Murgaxor** summons four **mud mephits** that appear in unoccupied spaces within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The mephits obey **Murgaxor**'s commands, take their turns on initiative count 15 (losing initiative ties), and fight until destroyed.

### Stopping the Ritual
If **Murgaxor**'s barrier and ritual stones are destroyed, **Murgaxor** loses access to his lair actions. In addition, any creatures or effects brought forth by his lair actions (such as the clay golem, the earthen fist, and the mud mephits) transform into heaps of harmless clay, earth, or mud. When **Murgaxor**'s ritual is stopped, read:

>>A warbling, high-pitched wail escapes **Murgaxor** as he crashes to the floor with a wet thump. A rush of air and a concussive blast momentarily replaces all sound. The thrum of magical power is gone.
>>

The pitiful, muddy figure on the floor is **Murgaxor** (use the **bullywug** stat block). When the ritual was disrupted, his powers dissipated as well. In this state, he no longer poses a threat to anyone. The characters have won!

## Heroes of Strixhaven
[img/book/SCC/115-06-011.faculty-members.webp](Strixhaven's faculty members celebrate the characters' victory over {@creature Murgaxor|SCC})

If the characters stop **Murgaxor**'s ritual, the mishaps plaguing Strixhaven University cease, and the corruption affecting Strixhaven's scholars vanishes. If **Murgaxor** survives the ritual's premature end, the characters have a choice to make. They can take him back to Strixhaven to stand trial for his crimes, or they can administer justice themselves.

News of **Murgaxor**'s defeat lifts the gloom on campus and restores its typically joyful atmosphere. Professor Sharpbeak tells the characters that the faculty plans to honor the heroes on their graduation day with a celebration attended by their Friends, Beloveds, and even Rivals. The faculty also offers each character a token of gratitude, in the form of a rare or uncommon magic item of the character's choice.

## Failing to Stop the Ritual
If all the characters fall unconscious or die in the final encounter, they fail to stop **Murgaxor**'s ritual. Shortly afterward, the ritual deals 70 (20d6) necrotic damage to everyone on campus as **Murgaxor** siphons their life force. Hundreds of scholars die, and many more are severely injured. **Murgaxor** becomes immortal and one of the most powerful spellcasters in the world. If the characters survive, perhaps the Founder Dragons and the archaics can guide them as they attempt to stop **Murgaxor** in a dystopian new world.
