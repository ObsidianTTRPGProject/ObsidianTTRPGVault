# Falling
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 77* 

## Falling

Falling from a great height is a significant risk for adventurers and their foes. The rule given in the "Player's Handbook" is simple: at the end of a fall, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fell, to a maximum of 20d6. You also land [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone), unless you somehow avoid taking damage from the fall. Here are two optional rules that expand on that simple rule.

### Rate of Falling

The rule for falling assumes that a creature immediately drops the entire distance when it falls. But what if a creature is at a high altitude when it falls, perhaps on the back of a [griffon](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) or on board an [airship](/compendium/items/airship.md)? Realistically, a fall from such a height can take more than a few seconds, extending past the end of the turn when the fall occurred. If you'd like high-altitude falls to be properly time-consuming, use the following optional rule.

When you fall from a great height, you instantly descend up to 500 feet. If you're still falling on your next turn, you descend up to 500 feet at the end of that turn. This process continues until the fall ends, either because you hit the ground or the fall is otherwise halted.

### Flying Creatures and Falling

A flying creature in flight falls if it is knocked [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone), if its speed is reduced to 0 feet, or if it otherwise loses the ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as the [fly](/compendium/spells/fly.md) spell.

If you'd like a flying creature to have a better chance of surviving a fall than a non-flying creature does, use this rule: subtract the creature's current flying speed from the distance it fell before calculating falling damage. This rule is helpful to a flier that is knocked [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) but is still conscious and has a current flying speed that is greater than 0 feet. The rule is designed to simulate the creature flapping its wings furiously or taking similar measures to slow the velocity of its fall.

If you use the rule for rate of falling in the previous section, a flying creature descends 500 feet on the turn when it falls, just as other creatures do. But if that creature starts any of its later turns still falling and is [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone), it can halt the fall on its turn by spending half its flying speed to counter the [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition (as if it were standing up in midair).
