# Massive Damage
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 273* 

This optional rule makes it easier for a creature to be felled by massive damage.

When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

**System Shock**

| dice: d10 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | The creature drops to 0 hit points. |
| 2-3 | The creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable. |
| 4-5 | The creature is [stunned](/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn. |
| 6-7 | The creature can't take reactions and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10 | The creature can't take reactions until the end of its next turn. |
