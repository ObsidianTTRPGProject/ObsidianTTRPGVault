## Downtime Activity: Work

When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character's attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

### Resources

Performing a job requires one workweek of effort.

### Resolution

To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)), Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)), Intelligence using a set of tools, Charisma ([Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance)), or Charisma using a musical instrument. Consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check.

**Wages**

| Check Total | Earnings |
|-------------|----------|
| 9 or lower | Poor lifestyle for the week |
| 10–14 | Modest lifestyle for the week |
| 15–20 | Comfortable lifestyle for the week |
| 21+ | Comfortable lifestyle for the week + 25 gp |

### Complications

Ordinary work is rarely filled with significant complications. Still, the Work Complications table can add some difficulties to a worker's life. Each workweek of activity brings a 10|10 percent% chance chance that a character encounters a complication.

**Work Complications**
