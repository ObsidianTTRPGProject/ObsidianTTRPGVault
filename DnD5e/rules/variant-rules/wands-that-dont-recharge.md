# Wands That Don't Recharge
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 141* 

A typical wand has expendable charges. If you'd like wands to be a limited resource, you can make some of them incapable of regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of charges in such a wand, to a maximum of 25 charges. These charges are never regained once they're expended.
