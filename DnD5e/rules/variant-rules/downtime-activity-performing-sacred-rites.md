# Downtime Activity: Performing Sacred Rites
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 129* 

A pious character can spend time between adventures performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god he or she reveres. Between rites, the character spends time in meditation and prayer.

A character who is a priest in the temple can lead these rites, which might include weddings, funerals, and ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple or assist a priest with a rite.

A character who spends at least 10 days performing sacred rites gains "inspiration" (described in chapter 4 of the "Player's Handbook") at the start of each day for the next 2d6 days.
