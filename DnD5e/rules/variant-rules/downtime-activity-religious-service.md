## Downtime Activity: Religious Service

Characters with a religious bent might want to spend downtime in service to a temple, either by attending rites or by proselytizing in the community. Someone who undertakes this activity has a chance of winning the favor of the temple's leaders.

### Resources

Performing religious service requires access to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs and ethos align with the character's. If such a place is available, the activity takes one workweek of time but involves no gold piece expenditure.

### Resolution

At the end of the required time, the character chooses to make either an Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check or a Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. The total of the check determines the benefits of service, as shown on the Religious Service table.

**Religious Service**

| Check Total | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 1–10 | No effect. Your efforts fail to make a lasting impression. |
| 11–20 | You earn one favor. |
| 21+ | You earn two favors. |

A favor, in broad terms, is a promise of future assistance from a representative of the temple. It can be expended to ask the temple for help in dealing with a specific problem, for general political or social support, or to reduce the cost of cleric spellcasting by 50 percent. A favor could also take the form of a deity's intervention, such as an omen, a vision, or a minor miracle provided at a key moment. This latter sort of favor is expended by the DM, who also determines its nature.

Favors earned need not be expended immediately, but only a certain number can be stored up. A character can have a maximum number of unused favors equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of one unused favor).

### Complications

Temples can be labyrinths of political and social scheming. Even the best-intentioned sect can fall prone to rivalries. A character who serves a temple risks becoming embroiled in such struggles. Every workweek spent in religious service brings a 10|10 percent% chance chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Religious Service Complications table.
