# Player Characters as Vampires
*Source: Monster Manual p. 295, Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 236* 

The game statistics of a player character transformed into a [vampire spawn](/compendium/bestiary/undead/vampire-spawn.md) and then a [vampire](/compendium/bestiary/undead/vampire.md) don't change, except that the character's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren't higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire's damage resistances, [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision), traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire's attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a [wish](/compendium/spells/wish.md) spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.

## Jiangshi

Humanoids killed by a [jiangshi](/compendium/bestiary/undead/jiangshi-vrgr.md) rise as life-hungry corpses and might turn into jiangshi themselves if they feed upon the living.
