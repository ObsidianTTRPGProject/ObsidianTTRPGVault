# Preservation (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of salt)

**Duration**: 1 week


## Effects
Up to 250 pounds of raw food will remain perfectly preserved for one week. This spell does not work on cooked food, nor does it prevent the food from being eaten during this time; it merely keeps it from rotting or going moldy.

This spell can also be used to preserve a corpse in preparation for being *raised*; a week of preservation counts only as one day for the purposes of the *raise dead* spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can preserve an additional 50 pounds for each slot level above 2nd.
