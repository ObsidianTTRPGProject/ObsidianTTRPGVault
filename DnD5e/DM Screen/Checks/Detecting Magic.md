# How Can a PC Detect Magic?

**Passive Detection** - The DM will decide whether a magic item, area, creature, or person emanates magical energy which the PCs can sense without having to actively make an effort.

**Arcana Check** - If the DM reports that magic is not evident, a PC may attempt to sense magic by making an [[Arcana]] Check (against a secret DC set by the DM). Spell casters may add their spellcasting ability modifier. PCs proficient in Arcana may add their proficiency modifier.

**Magic traps** always have a DC to detect the magic around them.

# **Detecting & Identifying Magic Items**

Detecting the magical nature of an item works the same as detecting magic generally. Magic items can sometimes be sensed by holding or being in close proximity to them, but it is more common for their magical nature to be hidden, in which case an Arcana Check is required. Arcana Checks can only be retried once per short or long rest until successful.

DC 10 - To determine that it is magic. 
DC 15 - To learn its properties.

There are other ways to learn about magic items, though.

Sometimes a magic item carries a **clue** to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it's a ring of feather falling.

**Wearing or Experimenting** with an item can also offer hints about its properties, and a **little taste of a potion** is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.

The **Identify Spell** is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties.
