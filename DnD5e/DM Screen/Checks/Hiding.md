**The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding.** Also, the question isn't whether a creature can see you when you are hiding. The question is whether it can see you clearly.

**When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.** Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

**There’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching.** The Stealth check is contested by the creature's Passive Perception score. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

**You can’t hide from a creature that can see you**, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position.

**An invisible creature can’t be seen, so it can always try to hide.** Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.

**In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you.** However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.

One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured.

In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have **disadvantage** on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the **blinded** condition.
