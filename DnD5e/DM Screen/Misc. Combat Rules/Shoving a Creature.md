### Shoving a Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

**The target of your shove must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach**.

**You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check** (the target chooses the ability to use).

If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push 
it 5 feet away from you.
