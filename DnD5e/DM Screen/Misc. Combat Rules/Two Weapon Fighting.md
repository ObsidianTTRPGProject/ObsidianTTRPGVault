### Two Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a **light melee weapon** that you’re **holding in one hand**, you can use a **bonus action** to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand.

**You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack**, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.
