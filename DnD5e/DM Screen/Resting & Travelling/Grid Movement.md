### Grid Movement

**Entering a Square**

To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in.

Diagonal Movement from DMG.

If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.

**Corners**

Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.

**Ranges**

To determine the range on a grid between two things— whether creatures or objects— start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.
