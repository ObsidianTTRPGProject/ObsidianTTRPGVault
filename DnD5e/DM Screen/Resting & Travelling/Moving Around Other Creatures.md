### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a non-hostile creature’s space.

You can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you.

Another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack.
