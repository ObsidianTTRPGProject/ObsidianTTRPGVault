# Exhaustion
## Overview
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

| Level | Effect |
|---|---|
| 1 | Disadvantage on [[Using Ability Scores#Ability Checks\|ability checks]] |
| 2 | [[Movement#Speed\|Speed]] halved |
| 3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4 | Hit point maximum halved |
| 5 | Speed reduced to 0 |
| 6 | Death |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its [[Movement#Speed|speed]] halved and has disadvantage on [[Using Ability Scores#Ability Checks|ability checks]].

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a [[uces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also <u>ingested</u> some food and drink.
