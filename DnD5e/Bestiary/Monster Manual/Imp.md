## Special Traits
***Shapechanger.*** The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a rat (speed 20 ft.), a raven (20 ft., fly 60 ft.), or a spider (20 ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the imp's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The imp has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Variant: Imp Familiar.*** Imps can be found in the service to mortal spellcasters, acting as advisors, spies, and familiars. An imp urges its master to acts of evil, knowing the mortal's soul is a prize the imp might ultimately claim. Imps display an unusual loyalty to their masters, and an imp can be quite dangerous if its master is threatened. Some such imps have the following trait.

***Familiar.*** The imp can enter into a contract to serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the imp senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the imp's Magic Resistance trait. If its master violates the terms of the contract, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.

## Actions
***Sting (Bite in Beast Form).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d4+3`) piercing damage, and the target must make on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`dice: 3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Invisibility.*** The imp magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the imp wears or carries is invisible with it.

## Description
Imps are found throughout the Lower Planes, either running errands for their infernal masters, spying on rivals, or misleading and waylaying mortals.

An imp will proudly serve an evil master of any kind, but it can't be relied on to carry out tasks with any speed or efficiency. An imp can assume animal form at will, but in its natural state it resembles a diminutive red-skinned humanoid with a barbed tail, small horns, and leathery wings. It strikes while invisible, attacking with its poison stinger.

## Variant: Imp Familiar
Imps can be found in the service to mortal spellcasters, acting as advisors, spies, and familiars. An imp urges its master to acts of evil, knowing the mortal's soul is a prize the imp might ultimately claim. Imps display an unusual loyalty to their masters, and an imp can be quite dangerous if its master is threatened. Some such imps have the following trait.

***Familiar.*** The imp can enter into a contract to serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master.
