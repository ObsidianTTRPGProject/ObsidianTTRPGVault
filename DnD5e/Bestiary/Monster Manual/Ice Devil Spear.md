## Special Traits
***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The devil makes two attacks: one with its spear and one with its tail.

***Ice Spear.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d8+5`) piercing damage plus 10 (`dice: 3d6`) cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or for 1 minute, its speed is reduced by 10 feet; it can take either an action or a bonus action on each of its turns, not both; and it can't take reactions. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (`dice: 2d6+5`) piercing damage plus 10 (`dice: 3d6`) cold damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (`dice: 2d4+5`) slashing damage plus 10 (`dice: 3d6`) cold damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (`dice: 2d6+5`) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (`dice: 3d6`) cold damage.

***Wall of Ice.*** The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter.

When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (`dice: 10d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (`dice: 5d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.

## Description
Found most commonly on the cold layers of Stygia and Cania, ice devils serve as commanders of the infernal armies of the Nine Hells, tormenting lesser devils as an outlet for their anger and resentment. Coveting the power of their [[Pit Fiend|pit fiend]] superiors, ice devils work ceaselessly toward promotion, slaughtering the enemies of the Nine Hells and claiming as many souls as they can for their archdevil masters.

Resembling a giant bipedal insect, an ice devil has clawed hands and feet, powerful mandibles, and a long tail covered in razor-sharp spikes. Some carry barbed spears whose icy touch can render a foe all but helpless in combat.
