## Description
A monster in every sense of the word, a manticore has a vaguely humanoid head, the body of a lion, and the wings of a dragon. A bristling mane stretches down the creature's back, and its long tail ends in a cluster of deadly spikes that can impale prey at impressive range.

***Evil Predators.*** Manticores are fierce killers that hunt far and wide for prey. They work together to take down particularly large or dangerous creatures, sharing the meal once a kill is made. A manticore begins its attack with a volley of tail spikes, then lands and uses its claws and bite. When outdoors and outnumbered, it uses its wings to stay aloft, attacking from a distance until its spikes are depleted.

A manticore isn't particularly bright, but it possesses a malevolent nature and the ability to converse. In the course of attacking, it denigrates its foes and offers to kill them swiftly if they beg for their lives. If a manticore sees an advantage to be gained by sparing a creature's life, it does so, asking for a tribute or sacrifice equal to its loss of food.

***Monstrous Relationships.*** Manticores serve wicked masters that treat them well and provide regular prey. A manticore might provide aerial support for an orc horde or a hobgoblin army. Another could serve as a hunting companion for a hill giant chief, or guard the entrance to a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Monster Manual/Lamia|lamia]]'s lair.

The manticores' greatest territorial rivals include [[Chimera|chimeras]], [[Griffon|griffons]], [[Peryton|perytons]], and [[Wyvern|wyverns]]. Manticores hunting as a pack often have the advantage of greater numbers. In addition to these creatures, manticores fear [[Dragons|dragons]] and avoid them.
