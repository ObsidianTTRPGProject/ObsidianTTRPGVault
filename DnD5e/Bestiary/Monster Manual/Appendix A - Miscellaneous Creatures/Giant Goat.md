## Special Traits
***Charge.*** If the goat moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 (`dice: 2d4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Sure-Footed.*** The goat has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

## Actions
***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (`dice: 2d4+3`) bludgeoning damage.
