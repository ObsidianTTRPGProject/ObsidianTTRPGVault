## Special Traits
***Distress Spores.*** When the myconid takes damage, all other [[Myconids|myconids]] within 240 feet of it can sense its pain.

***Sun Sickness.*** While in sunlight, the myconid has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.

## Actions
***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 (`dice: 1d4-1`) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (`dice: 1d4`) poison damage.

***Rapport Spores (3/Day).*** A 10-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
