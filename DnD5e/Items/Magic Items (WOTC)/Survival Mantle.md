# Survival Mantle

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** unknown

**Weight**: 40 lbs.

## Description

This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer's shoulders, neck, and chest. A survival mantle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half plate armor and takes just as long to don or doff. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.

A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum) and has advantage on saving throws against harmful gases (such as those created by a [[cloudkill]]  spell, a [[stinking cloud]]  spell, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
