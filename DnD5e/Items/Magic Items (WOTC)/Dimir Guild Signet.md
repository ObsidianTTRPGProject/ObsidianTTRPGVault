## Description

This ring, adorned with the symbol of Dimir, allows you to cast [[disguise self]]. A guild signet is sometimes awarded to a guild member whose renown score in that guild is 5 or higher, as a reward for performing special services for the guild. Aside from its magical properties, the ring is also an indicator of Dimir's recognition and favor.

A signet has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).
