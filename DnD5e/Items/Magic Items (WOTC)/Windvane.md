## Description

A silver spear, Windvane has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of [[Yan-C-Bin]], the Prince of Evil Air. 

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse weapon property. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra `dice: 1d6` lightning damage.

**Air Mastery** You gain the following benefits while you hold Windvane:

- You can speak Auran fluently.

- You have resistance to lightning damage.

- You can cast [[dominate monster]]  (save DC 17) on an [[air elemental}. Once you have done so, Windvane can't be used this
way again until the next dawn.

**Song of the Four Winds** While inside an air node, you can perform a ritual called the Song of the Four Winds, using Windvane to create a [[devastation orb of air]]. Once you perform the ritual, Windvane can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

**Flaw** Windvane makes its wielder mercurial and unreliable. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I break my vows and plans. Duty and honor mean nothing to me." 

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
