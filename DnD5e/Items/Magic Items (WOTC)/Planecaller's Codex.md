The pages of this book are bound in fiend hide, and its cover is  embossed with a diagram of the Great Wheel of the multiverse. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[banishment]], [[Find Familiar (Ritual)|Find Familiar]], [[gate]], [[magic circle]], [[planar binding]], and [[summon elemental]] . It functions as a spellbook for you.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.
