**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Melee Weapon, Simple weapon, Dagger

**Rarity:** legendary

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Weight**: 1 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d4 piercing - finesse, light, thrown

## Description

This +3 dagger belongs to [[Artus Cimber]] . While you have the dagger drawn, you can use a bonus action to activate one of the following properties:

Cause a blue gem set into the dagger's pommel to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet, or make the gem go dark.

Turn the dagger into a compass that, while resting on your palm, points north.

Cast [[dimension door]]  from the dagger. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Cast [[compulsion]]  (save DC 15) from the dagger. The range of the spell increases to 90 feet but it targets only spiders that are beasts. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
