## Description

A weird tank is a ten-gallon tank of blown glass and sculpted bronze with a backpack-like carrying harness fashioned from tough leather. A [[water weird]]  is contained within the tank. While wearing the tank, you can use an action to open it, allowing the [[water weird]] to emerge. The [[water weird]]   acts immediately after you in the initiative order, and it is bound to the tank.

You can command the [[water weird]]  telepathically (no action required) while you wear the tank. You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded the [[water weird]]  to retract into it or if the [[water weird]]  is dead.

If the [[water weird]]  is killed, the tank loses its magical containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water node. When the tank is recharged, a new [[water weird]] forms inside it.

The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the [[water weird]]  contained within it.
