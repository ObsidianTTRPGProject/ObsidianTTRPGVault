# Speaking Stone

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** very rare

## Description

The key to long-distance, virtually instantaneous communication across Khorvaire is House Sivis's network of message stations. Each station contains at least one speaking stone, which is carved from a Siberys dragonshard and inscribed with arcane symbols that uniquely identify it. If you're a gnome with the Mark of Scribing, you can touch the stone and use an action to cast the [[sending]]  spell from it. The target is any other speaking stone whose location or unique sequence of symbols you know. A creature within 5 feet of the stone hears the message as if they were the target.

In a Sivis message station, a gnome is always on duty by the speaking stone, listening for messages that might come in and transcribing them for delivery to their intended recipients.
