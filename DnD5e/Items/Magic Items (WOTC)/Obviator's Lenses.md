# Obviator's Lenses

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** varies

## Description

Also at rank 2, you gain the use of an uncommon magic item taking the form of a pair of spectacles, a spyglass, a monocle, or any other device with one or two lenses. When you look through the obviator's lenses, you use a bonus action to make them function as [[eyes of minute seeing]] or [[eyes of the eagle]]. Once you make this choice, it cannot be changed until the next dawn.

**Enhanced Lenses** At rank 4, your obviator's lenses gain additional power and become a rare magic item. The lenses now function as both [[eyes of the eagle]] and [[eyes of minute seeing]].

Additionally, you can focus the power of the lenses to gain accuracy in combat, gaining advantage on a weapon attack roll (no action required). If that attack hits, roll one additional weapon damage die. This property of the lenses can't be used again until the next dawn.
