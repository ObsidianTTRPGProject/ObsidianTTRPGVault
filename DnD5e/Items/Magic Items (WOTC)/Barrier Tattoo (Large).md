# Barrier Tattoo (Large)

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Tattoo

**Rarity:** very rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

## Description

This tattoo depicts protective imagery and uses ink that resembles liquid metal. While you aren't wearing armor, the tattoo grants you an Armor Class of 18. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

**Tattoo Attunement** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in the closest unoccupied space to you.

**Protection.** While you aren't wearing armor, the tattoo grants you an Armor Class of 18. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
