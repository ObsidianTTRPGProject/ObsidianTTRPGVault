# Devastation Orb of Earth

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** very rare

## Description

A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a [[devastation orb of air]]. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.

A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates `dice: 1d100` hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as [[Identify (Ritual)|Identify]]  and [[Divination (Ritual)|Divination]]  can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.

A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb's opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a [[devastation orb of air]] and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes `dice: 1d6` rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.

Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere's point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.

**Earth Orb** When this orb detonates, it subjects the area to the effects of the [[earthquake]]  spell for 1 minute (spell save DC 18). For the purpose of the spell's effects, the spell is cast on the turn that the orb explodes.
