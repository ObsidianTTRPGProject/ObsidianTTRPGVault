# Mizzium Mortar

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** rare

## Description

This short tube, about 2 feet long and 6 inches in diameter, is made from mizzium, a magically enhanced metal alloy forged by the Izzet League. The end that's pointed toward a target is open, and a glowing ball of molten metal can be seen at the other end as long as the mortar has at least 1 charge remaining.

The mortar has 4 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice: 1d4` expended charges daily at dawn.

**Molten Spray** You can expend 1 charge as an action to loose a 30-foot cone of molten mizzium. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice: 5d4` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Mizzium Bombard** You can expend 3 charges as an action to launch a hail of molten projectiles in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice: {1}` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
