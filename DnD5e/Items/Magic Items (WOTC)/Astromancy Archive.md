## Description

This brass disc of articulated, concentric rings unfolds into an armillary sphere. As a bonus action, you can unfold it into the sphere or back into a disc. When found, it contains the following spells, which are wizard spells for you while you are attuned to it: [[augury]], [[Divination (Ritual)|divination]] , [[find the path]] , [[foresight]] , [[locate creature]], and [[locate object]] . It functions as a spellbook for you, with spells encoded on the rings.

While you are holding the archive, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The archive has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the archive, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the archive. The new spell must be of the divination school.

- When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and force the creature to roll a `dice: d4` and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the original roll. You can do this after you see the roll but before its effects are applied.
