## Description

A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, Orcsplitter is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for "orc," but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word "orc" is literally split in two.

You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:

- You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

- When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an [[orc]], that [[orc]]  must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.

- You can't be surprised by [[orc|orcs]]  while you're not [[Incapacitated]]. You are also aware when [[orc|orcs} are within 120 feet of you and aren't behind total cover, although you don't know their location.

- You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can't be [[frightened} while you're not [[Incapacitated]].

**Sentience** Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has [[darkvision]]. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse.

**Personality** Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face [[orc|orcs]]  in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves—giants, goblins, and, most of all, [[orc|orcs]] —and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.

**Heavy.** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
