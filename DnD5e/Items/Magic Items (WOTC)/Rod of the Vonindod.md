# Rod of the Vonindod

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Rods

**Rarity:** rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Weight**: 2 lbs.

## Description

The [[fire giant]]  Duke Zalto hired a wizard to craft several of these adamantine rods. Each measures 4 feet long, weighs 100 pounds, and is sized to fit comfortably in a [[fire giant|fire giant's]]  hand. The rod has two prongs at one end and a molded handle grip on the opposite end.

The rod has 10 charges and regains `dice: 1d6 + 4` of its expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can grasp it by the handle and expend 1 charge to cast the [[locate object]]  spell from it. When the rod is used to detect objects made of adamantine, such as fragments of the Vonindod construct, its range increases to 10 miles.
