# Ascendant Dragon's Wrath Weapon

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** legendary

## Overview

This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon's hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.

Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra `dice: 3d6` damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon.

As an action, you can unleash a 60-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice: 12d6` damage of the type dealt by the dragon's breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
