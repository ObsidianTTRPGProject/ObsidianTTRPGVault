# Finder's Goggles

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** uncommon

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a creature with the Mark of Finding

## Description

The lenses of these garish goggles are carved from Siberys dragonshards. While wearing these lenses, you gain the following benefits:

- When you make a Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check, you can roll a `dice: d4` and add the number rolled to the check.

- As an action, you can use the goggles to examine an object to identify the aura of the last creature that touched it. Make a Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check against a DC of 13 + the number of days since the last contact occurred. On a success, you learn the creature's type and can immediately use the goggles to cast [[locate creature]] to find that creature. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
