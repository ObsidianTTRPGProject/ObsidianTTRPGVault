## Description

This magic sword's blade is fashioned from a horn or spine from a crystal dragon. When you hit with an attack roll using this sword, the target takes an extra `dice: 1d8` radiant damage.

While you're holding the sword, you can use a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, to cause it to shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, or to douse the light.
