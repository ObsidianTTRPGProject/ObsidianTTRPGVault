# Spider Staff

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Staff, Melee Weapon

**Rarity:** rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Weight**: 6 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d6 bludgeoning versatile (1d8)

## Description

The top of this black, adamantine staff is shaped like a spider. The staff weighs 6 pounds. You must be attuned to the staff to gain its benefits and cast its spells. The staff can be wielded as a quarterstaff. It deals `dice: 1d6` extra poison damage on a hit when used to make a weapon attack.

The staff has 10 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the staff in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the staff if the spell is on your class's spell list: [[spider climb]]  (1 charge) or [[web]]  (2 charges, spell save DC 15). No components are required.

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4` expended charges each day at dusk. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
