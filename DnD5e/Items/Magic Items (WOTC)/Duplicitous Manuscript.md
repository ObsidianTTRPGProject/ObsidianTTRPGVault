## Description

To you, this book is a magical spellbook. To anyone else, the book appears to be a volume of verbose romance fiction. As an action, you can change the book's appearance and alter the plot of the romance.

When found, the book contains the following spells: [[hallucinatory terrain]], [[major image]], [[mirror image]], [[mislead]], [[Nystul's Magical Aura]], [[Phantasmal Force]], and [[silent image]] . It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the illusion school.

- When a creature you can see makes an Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern the true nature of an illusion spell you cast, or makes a saving throw against an illusion spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the roll.
