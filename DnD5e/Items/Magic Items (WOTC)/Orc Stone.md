# Orc Stone

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** uncommon

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a recipient only

## Description

I saved the life of an orc, who gave me a stone with the symbol of the Many-Arrows tribe (a humanoid skull pierced by three arrows) carved into it. The stone is an uncommon magic item that requires attunement, and only I can attune to it.

As an action, I can use the stone to summon the spirit of an orc warrior, which appears within 30 feet of me. The spirit uses the [[orc war chief]]  stat block in the Monster Manual and disappears after 10 minutes or when reduced to 0 hit points. The spirit understands any language I speak and obeys my commands.

After the stone is used three times, it turns to dust. (See Appendix B of Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden)
