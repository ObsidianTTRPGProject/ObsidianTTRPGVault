## Description

Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the [[twig blight|blights]] entry of the Monster Manual), a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes  beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains `dice: 1d6 + 4` of its expended charges daily at dusk.

If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.

**Vampiric Strike** The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with [[Short-Term Madness|short term madness]] (see "**Madness**" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

**Blight Bane** While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them.
