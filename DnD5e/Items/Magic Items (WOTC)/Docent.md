# Docent

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a warforged

## Description

A docent is a small metal sphere, about 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. To attune to a docent, you must embed the item somewhere on your body, such as your chest or your eye socket.

**Sentience** A docent is a sentient item of any alignment with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It perceives the world through your senses. It communicates telepathically with you and can speak, read, and understand any language it knows (see "Random Properties" below).

**Life Support** Whenever you end your turn with 0 hit points, the docent can make a Wisdom ([[Medicine]]) check with a +6 bonus. If this check succeeds, the docent stabilizes you.

**Random Properties** A docent has the following properties:  

**Languages**. The docent knows Common, Giant, and `dice: 1d4` additional languages chosen by the DM. If a docent knows fewer than six languages, it can learn a new language after it hears or reads the language through your senses.

**Skills**. The docent has a +7 bonus to one of the following skills (roll a `dice: d4`): (1) [[Arcana]], (2) [[History]], (3) [[Investigation]], or (4) [[Nature]].

**Spells**. The docent knows one of the following spells and can cast it at will, requiring no components (roll a `dice: d6`): (1–2) [[detect evil and good]]  or (3–6) [[Detect Magic (Ritual)|Detect Magic]] . The docent decides when to cast the spell.

**Personality** A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent's properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent, it might refuse to assist you.
