# Shield of Far Sight

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Armor, Shield

**Rarity:** rare

**Weight**: 6 lbs.

## Description

A [[mind flayer]]  skilled at crafting magic items creates a shield of far sight by harvesting an eye from an intelligent humanoid and magically implanting it on the outer surface of a nonmagical shield. The shield becomes a magic item once the eyes is implanted, whereupon the [[mind flayer]]  can give the shield to a thrall or hang it on a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the [[mind flayer]]  can see through the shield's eye, which has [[darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the [[mind flayer]] can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield.

If a shield of far sight is destroyed, the [[mind flayer]] that created it is [[blinded]] for `dice: 2d12` hours.
