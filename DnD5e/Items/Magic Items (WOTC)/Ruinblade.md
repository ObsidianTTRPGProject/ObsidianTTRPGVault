## Description

Ruinblade is a unique weapon possessed by [[Moghadam]], the
architect of the Tomb of Horrors. A symbol of his authority, Moghadam
carries the weapon during the time frame of the adventure to intimidate
the tomb's workers. (In later years, after [[Acererak]] 
trapped Moghadam in the completed tomb as an undead archwraith, Moghadam
was able to use the weapon as his own phylactery.)

A small jade version of the green devil face of the Tomb of Horrors is
fashioned into the hilt of the weapon, with the blade extending from its
open mouth. The blade always appears ruined and rusting, and causes its
surroundings to appear reflected in the blade as if in a state of decay.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. When you hit an undead creature with it, the attack deals an
extra `dice: 1d8` force damage.
  - 'In addition, the weapon has the following properties:- type: entries
# Blighted Ruin 

You can cast the [[blight]] spell from the weapon (DC 15). Once
used, this property of the weapon can't be used until the next dawn.
# Destructive Ruin 

You can cast the [[disintegrate]]  spell from the weapon, but
can target only a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force.
Once used, this property of the weapon can't be used until dawn
seven days later.
# Curse 

This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse
to you. Until the curse is broken with a [[remove curse]]  spell
or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon.

The weapon must take direct part in the destruction of 1,000 gp
worth of materials and objects every seven days, or a conflict
arises between you and the weapon at the end of the seventh day.
# Sentience 

Ruinblade is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of
15, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can
communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is a rough,
ruined echo. While you are attuned to it, Ruinblade also understands
every language you know.
# Personality 

Ruinblade speaks either with a dolorous or frenetic tone, depending
on its mood. That mood improves when the sword is actively engaged
in acts of destruction, but worsens if the blade is left inactive
too long.

The weapon's purpose is to ruin and unmake existing objects, so that
its owner can rebuild the world from a blank slate. It thus
encourages its wielder to engage in constant destruction, claiming
that this will allow the creation of a more superior vision from the
ruin of what came before.
