# Guardian Emblem

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** uncommon

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a cleric or paladin

**Weight**: 0.02 lbs.

## Description

This emblem is the symbol of a deity or a spiritual tradition. As an action, you can attach the emblem to a suit of armor or a shield or remove it.

The emblem has 3 charges. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit while you're wearing the armor or wielding the shield that bears the emblem, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to turn the critical hit into a normal hit instead.

The emblem regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
