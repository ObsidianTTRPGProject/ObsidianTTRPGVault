# Professor Orb

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** rare

**Weight**: 5 lbs.

## Description

Each professor orb takes the form of a smooth, solid, 5-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere.

A Professor Orb is sentient and has the personality of a scholar. Its alignment is determined by rolling on the alignment table in the "Sentient Magic Items|7|Sentient Magic Items" section in chapter 7 of the [[Dungeon Master's Guide]]. Regardless of its disposition, the orb has an Intelligence of 18, and Wisdom and Charisma scores determined by rolling `dice: 3d6` for each ability. The orb speaks, reads, and understands four languages, and can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of its own and can't initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.

A Professor Orb has extensive knowledge of four narrow academic subjects. When making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).

In addition to the knowledge it possesses, a professor orb can cast the [[mage hand]]  cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence.
