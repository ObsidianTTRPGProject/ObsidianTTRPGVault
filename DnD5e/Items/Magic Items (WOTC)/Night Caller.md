# Night Caller

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** uncommon

**Weight**: 1 lbs.

## Description

This whistle is carved from transparent crystal, and it resembles a tiny dragon curled up like a snail. The name Night Caller is etched on the whistle in Dwarvish runes. If a character succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([[Arcana]] or [[History]]) check, the character  recalls lore that says the [[duergar]]  made several such whistles for various groups in an age past.

If you blow the whistle in darkness or under the night sky, it allows you to cast the [[animate dead]]  spell. The target can be affected through up to 10 feet of soft earth or similar material, and if it is, it takes 1 minute to claw its way to the surface to serve you. Once the whistle has animated an undead creature, it can't do so again until 7 days have passed.

Once every 24 hours, you can blow the whistle to reassert control over one or two creatures you animated with it.
