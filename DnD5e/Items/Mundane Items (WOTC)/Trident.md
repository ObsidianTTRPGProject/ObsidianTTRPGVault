# Trident
**Type**: Mundane Item
**Group**: weapon, martial weapon, melee weapon
**Properties**: 1d6, piercing, - thrown (20/60 ft.), versatile (1d8)
**Weight**: 4 lb.
**Value**: 5 gp
## Description: 
 Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
