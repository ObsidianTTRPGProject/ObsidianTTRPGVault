# Dagger
**Type**: Mundane Item
**Group**: weapon, simple weapon, melee weapon
**Properties**: 1d4, piercing, - finesse, light, thrown (20/60 ft.)
**Weight**: 1 lb.
**Value**: 2 gp
## Description: 
 Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
