# Hail of Thorns
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice: 1d10|avg|noform` (`1d10`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of `dice: 6d10|avg|noform` (`6d10`)).

**Classes**: [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/ranger.md)
