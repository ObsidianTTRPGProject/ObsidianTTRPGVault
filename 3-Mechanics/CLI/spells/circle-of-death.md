# Circle of Death
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*6th-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at least 500 gp
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius sphere from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes `dice: 8d6|avg|noform` (`8d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by `2d6` for each slot level above 6th.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Warlock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
