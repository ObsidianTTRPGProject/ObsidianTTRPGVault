# Counterspell
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
