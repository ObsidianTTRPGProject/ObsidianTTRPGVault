# Spike Growth
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes `dice: 2d4|avg|noform` (`2d4`) piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Nature Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-nature-domain.md), [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid-circle-of-the-land.md), [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid.md), [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/ranger.md)
