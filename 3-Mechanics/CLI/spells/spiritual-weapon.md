# Spiritual Weapon
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to `dice: 1d8|avg|noform` (`1d8`) + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for every two slot levels above 2nd.
