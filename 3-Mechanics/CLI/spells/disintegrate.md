# Disintegrate
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a lodestone and a pinch of dust
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [wall of force](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-force.md).

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `dice: 10d6 + 40|avg|noform` (`10d6 + 40`) force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [true resurrection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-resurrection.md) or a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by `3d6` for each slot level above 6th.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md)
