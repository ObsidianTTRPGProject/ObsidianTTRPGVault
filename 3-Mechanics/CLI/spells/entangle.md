# Entangle
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

**Classes**: [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/druid.md)
