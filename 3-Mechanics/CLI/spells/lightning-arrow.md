# Lightning Arrow
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition, or the weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes `dice: 4d8|avg|noform` (`4d8`) lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's normal damage.

Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes `dice: 2d8|avg|noform` (`2d8`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/ranger.md)
