# Power Word Heal
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*9th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), or [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned), the condition ends. If the creature is [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone), it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/bard.md)
