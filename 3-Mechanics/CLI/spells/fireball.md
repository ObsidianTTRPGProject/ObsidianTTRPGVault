# Fireball
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Evocation*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/fireball.webp#right)  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes `dice: 8d6|avg|noform` (`8d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 3rd.
