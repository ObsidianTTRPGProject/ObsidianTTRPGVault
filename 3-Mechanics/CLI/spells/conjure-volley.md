# Conjure Volley
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, one piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice: 8d8|avg|noform` (`8d8`) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon.

**Classes**: [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/ranger.md)
