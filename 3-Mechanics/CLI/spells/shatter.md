# Shatter
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a chip of mica
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `dice: 3d8|avg|noform` (`3d8`) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 2nd.
