# Destructive Wave
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 5d6|avg|noform` (`5d6`) thunder damage, as well as `dice: 5d6|avg|noform` (`5d6`) radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

**Classes**: [Cleric (Tempest Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/cleric-tempest-domain.md), [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/classes/paladin.md)
