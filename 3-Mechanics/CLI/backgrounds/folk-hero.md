# Folk Hero
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 131. Available in the Basic Rules.*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Animal Handling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling), [Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of artisan's tools, vehicles (land)  
- **Equipment.** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a [shovel](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shovel.md), an [iron pot](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/iron-pot.md), a set of [common clothes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/common-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp  

You come from a humble social rank, but you are destined for so much more. Already the people of your home village regard you as their champion, and your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere.

## Feature: Rustic Hospitality

Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

## Specialty

You previously pursued a simple profession among the peasantry, perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant, shepherd, woodcutter, or gravedigger. But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that marked you as a hero of the people.

## Suggested Characteristics

A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them.
