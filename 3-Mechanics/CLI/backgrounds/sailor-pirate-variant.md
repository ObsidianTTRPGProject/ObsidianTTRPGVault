# Sailor (Pirate) (Variant)
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 139*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Athletics](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics), [Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** [Navigator's tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/navigators-tools.md), vehicles (water)  
- **Equipment.** A belaying pin ([club](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/club.md)), [silk rope (50 feet)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/silk-rope-50-feet.md), a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random [trinket](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/trinket.md) on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of [common clothes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/common-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp  

You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You've indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.

If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy, you can choose the Bad Reputation feature instead of the Ship's Passage feature.

## Feature: Bad Reputation

No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.

## Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.
