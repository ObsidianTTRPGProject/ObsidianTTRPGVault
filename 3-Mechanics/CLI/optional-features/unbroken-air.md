# Unbroken Air
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 81*  

You can create a blast of compressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice: 3d10|avg|noform` (`3d10`) bludgeoning damage, plus an extra `dice: 1d10|avg|noform` (`1d10`) bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock it [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't push it or knock it [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).
