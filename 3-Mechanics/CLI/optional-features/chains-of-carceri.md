# Chains of Carceri
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 110. Available in the SRD.*  

**Prerequisite**: 15th-level, Pact of the Chain

You can cast [hold monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-monster.md) at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.
