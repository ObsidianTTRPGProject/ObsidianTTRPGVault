# Appendix C: Maps
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 310* 

Creating a map for an adventure is a fun, challenging, and time-consuming endeavor. However, unless you have something specific in mind, you're better off conserving your time and energy by repurposing an existing map. Published adventures and the Internet are terrific sources for maps. A few sample maps are included here as well. Use them as you will!
