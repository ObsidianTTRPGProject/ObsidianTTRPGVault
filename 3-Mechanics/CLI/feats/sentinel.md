# Sentinel
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 169*  

You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits:

- When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.  
- Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the [Disengage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage) action before leaving your reach.  
- When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.
