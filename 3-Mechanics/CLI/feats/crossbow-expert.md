# Crossbow Expert
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 165*  

Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.  
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.  
- When you use the [Attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a [hand crossbow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/hand-crossbow.md) you are holding.
