# War Caster
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 170*  

**Prerequisite**: The ability to cast at least one spell

You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on a spell when you take damage.  
- You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a [shield](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shield.md) in one or both hands.  
- When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.
