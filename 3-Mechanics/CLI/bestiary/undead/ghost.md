    \ It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and\

  "name": "Etherealness"
- "desc": "Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must\
    \ succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10\
    \ years. A [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) target\
    \ can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or\
    \ the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage\
    \ for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a  [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring."
  "name": "Horrifying Visage"
- "desc": "One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on\
    \ a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears,\
    \ and the target is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive\
    \ the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or\
    \ other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,\
    \ Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed)\
    \ and [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened). It otherwise\
    \ uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's\
    \ knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.\n\nThe possession lasts until the\
    \ body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost\
    \ is turned or forced out by an effect like the [dispel evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space\
    \ within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for\
    \ 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
