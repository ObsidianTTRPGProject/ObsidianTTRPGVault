    \ except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and\
    \ they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the\
    \ treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant\
    \ dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus\
    \ action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible."
