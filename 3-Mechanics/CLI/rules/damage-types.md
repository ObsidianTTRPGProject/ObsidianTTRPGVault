# Damage Types
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 196. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.* 

## Acid

## Cold

The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.

Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.

## Psychic

Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage.

## Radiant

Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's flame strike spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.
