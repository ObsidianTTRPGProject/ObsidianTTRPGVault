# Downtime Activity: Practicing a Profession
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 187* 

You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.

If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the [Performance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance) skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.
