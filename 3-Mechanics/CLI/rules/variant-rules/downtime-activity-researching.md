# Downtime Activity: Researching
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 187* 

The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.

When you begin your research, the DM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).
