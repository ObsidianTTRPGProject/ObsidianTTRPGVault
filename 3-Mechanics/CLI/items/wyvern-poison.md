# Wyvern Poison
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 1,200 gp

This poison must be harvested from a dead or [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) [wyvern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md). A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:7d6|text(24)` (`7d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
