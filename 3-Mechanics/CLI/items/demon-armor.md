# Demon Armor
*Heavy Armor, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 65.0 lbs.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor's clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and a damage die of `dice: 1d8|avg|noform` (`1d8`).

## Curse

Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
