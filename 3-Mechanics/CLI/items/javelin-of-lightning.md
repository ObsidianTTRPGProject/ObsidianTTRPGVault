# Javelin of Lightning
*Melee Weapon, major, uncommon*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 P
- **Range**: 30/120
- **Properties**: [Thrown](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice: 4d6|avg|noform` (`4d6`) lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus `dice: 4d6|avg|noform` (`4d6`) lightning damage.

The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.
