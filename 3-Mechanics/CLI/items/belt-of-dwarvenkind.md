# Belt of Dwarvenkind
*Wondrous Item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  


While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:

- Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.  
- You have advantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks made to interact with dwarves.  

In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50% chance chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you're capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one.

If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing the belt:

- You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.  
- You have [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.  
- You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.
