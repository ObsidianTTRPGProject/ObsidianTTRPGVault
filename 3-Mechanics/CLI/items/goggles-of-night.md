# Goggles of Night
*Wondrous Item, minor, uncommon*  


While wearing these dark lenses, you have [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision), wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
