# Philter of Love
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  


The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed). This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
