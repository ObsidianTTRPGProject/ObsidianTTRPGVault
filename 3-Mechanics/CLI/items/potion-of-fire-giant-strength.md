# Potion of Fire Giant Strength
*Potion, minor, rare*  


When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes to 25 for 1 hour. The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a [fire giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md).
