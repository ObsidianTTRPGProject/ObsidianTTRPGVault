# Hammer of Thunderbolts
*Melee Weapon, major, legendary*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 B
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), Martial, [Two-handed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed)
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

## Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement)

You must be wearing a *belt of giant strength* (any variety) and [gauntlets of ogre power](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/gauntlets-of-ogre-power.md) to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.

The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains `dice: 1d4 + 1|avg|noform` (`1d4 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn.
