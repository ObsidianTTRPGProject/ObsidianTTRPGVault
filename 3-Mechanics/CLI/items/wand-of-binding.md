# Wand of Binding
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg|noform` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg|noform` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

## Spells

While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): [hold monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-monster.md) (5 charges) or [hold person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md) (2 charges).

## Assisted Escape

While holding the wand, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw you make to avoid being [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) or [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), or you can expend 1 charge and gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple.
