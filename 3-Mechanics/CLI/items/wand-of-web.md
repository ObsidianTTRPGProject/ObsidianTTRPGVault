# Wand of Web
*Wand, major, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [web](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/web.md) spell (save DC 15) from it.

The wand regains `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg|noform` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg|noform` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
