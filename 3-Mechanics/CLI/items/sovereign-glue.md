# Sovereign Glue
*Wondrous Item, minor, legendary*  


This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [oil of slipperiness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/oil-of-slipperiness.md). When found, a container contains `dice: 1d6 + 1|avg|noform` (`1d6 + 1`) ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [universal solvent](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/universal-solvent.md) or [oil of etherealness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/oil-of-etherealness.md), or with a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell.
