# Assassin's Blood
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 150 gp

A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:1d12|text(6)` (`1d12`) poison damage and is [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned).
