# Ring of the Ram
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  


This ring has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3|avg|noform` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to make a ranged spell attack against one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes `dice: 2d10|avg|noform` (`2d10`) force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.

Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn't being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.
