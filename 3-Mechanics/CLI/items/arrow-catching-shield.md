# Arrow-Catching Shield
*Shield, major, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
