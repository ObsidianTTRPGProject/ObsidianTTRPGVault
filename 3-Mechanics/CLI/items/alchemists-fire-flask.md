# Alchemist's Fire (flask)
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 50 gp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
