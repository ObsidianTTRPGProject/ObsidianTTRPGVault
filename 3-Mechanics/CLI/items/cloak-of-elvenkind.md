# Cloak of Elvenkind
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
