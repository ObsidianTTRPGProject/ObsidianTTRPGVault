# Basic Poison (vial)
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 100 gp

You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 1d4|avg|noform` (`1d4`) poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.
