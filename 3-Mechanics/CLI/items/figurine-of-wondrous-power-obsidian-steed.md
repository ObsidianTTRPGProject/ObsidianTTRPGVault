# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Obsidian Steed
*Wondrous Item, major, very rare*  


A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.

## Obsidian Steed

This polished obsidian horse can become a [nightmare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nightmare.md) for up to 24 hours. The [nightmare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nightmare.md) fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.

If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10% chance chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the [nightmare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nightmare.md) while it is ignoring your orders, you and the [nightmare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nightmare.md) are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the [nightmare](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nightmare.md) reverts to figurine form.
