# Staff of Healing
*Staff, major, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, or druid)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: [cure wounds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cure-wounds.md) (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), [lesser restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) (2 charges). or [mass cure wounds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mass-cure-wounds.md) (5 charges).

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4|avg|noform` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20|avg|noform` (`d20`). On a 1. the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
