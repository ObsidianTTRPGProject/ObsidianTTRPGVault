# Ring of Evasion
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  


This ring has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3|avg|noform` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.
