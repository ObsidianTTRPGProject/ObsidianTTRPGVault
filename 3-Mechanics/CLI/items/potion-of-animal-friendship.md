# Potion of Animal Friendship
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  


When you drink this potion, you can cast the [animal friendship](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/animal-friendship.md) spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
