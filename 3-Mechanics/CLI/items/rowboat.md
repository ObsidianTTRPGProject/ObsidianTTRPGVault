# Rowboat
*Ship, Vehicle (water)*  

- **Cost**: 50 gp
- **Weight**: 100.0 lbs.

Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers, If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.
