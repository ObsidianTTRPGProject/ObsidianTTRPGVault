# Periapt of Proof against Poison
*Wondrous Item, major, rare*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition and have immunity to poison damage.
