# Purple Worm Poison
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 2,000 gp

This poison must be harvested from a dead or [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) [purple worm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md). A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:12d6|text(42)` (`12d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
