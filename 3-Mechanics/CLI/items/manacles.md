# Manacles
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 2 gp
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with [thieves' tools](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md) can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.
