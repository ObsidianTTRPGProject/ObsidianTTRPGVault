# Essence of Ether
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 300 gp

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 8 hours. The [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature is [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious). The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
