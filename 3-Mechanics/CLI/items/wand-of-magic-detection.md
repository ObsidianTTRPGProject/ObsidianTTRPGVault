# Wand of Magic Detection
*Wand, minor, uncommon*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell from it. The wand regains `dice: 1d3|avg|noform` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn.
