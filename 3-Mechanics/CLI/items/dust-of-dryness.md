# Dust of Dryness
*Wondrous Item, minor, uncommon*  


This small packet contains `dice: 1d6 + 4|avg|noform` (`1d6 + 4`) pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet's magic.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 10d6|avg|noform` (`10d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
