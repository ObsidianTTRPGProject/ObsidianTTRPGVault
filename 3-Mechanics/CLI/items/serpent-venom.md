# Serpent Venom
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 200 gp

This poison must be harvested from a dead or [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) [giant poisonous snake](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-poisonous-snake.md). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:3d6|text(10)` (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
