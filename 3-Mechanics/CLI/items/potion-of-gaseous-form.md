# Potion of Gaseous Form
*Potion, minor, rare*  


When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [gaseous form](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md) spell for 1 hour (no [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
