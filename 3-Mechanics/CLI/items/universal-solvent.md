# Universal Solvent
*Wondrous Item, minor, legendary*  


This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. You can use an action to pour the contents of the tube onto a surface within reach. The liquid instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches, including [sovereign glue](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/sovereign-glue.md).
