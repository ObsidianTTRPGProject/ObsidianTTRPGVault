# Helm of Teleportation
*Wondrous Item, major, rare (requires attunement)*  


This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the [teleport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport.md) spell from it. The helm regains `dice: 1d3|avg|noform` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn.
