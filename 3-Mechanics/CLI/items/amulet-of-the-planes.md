# Amulet of the Planes
*Wondrous Item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a `dice: d100|avg|noform` (`d100`). On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.
