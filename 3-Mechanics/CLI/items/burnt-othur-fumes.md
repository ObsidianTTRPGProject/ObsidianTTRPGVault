# Burnt Othur Fumes
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 500 gp

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:3d6|text(10)` (`3d6`) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes `dice:1d6|text(3)` (`1d6`) poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.
