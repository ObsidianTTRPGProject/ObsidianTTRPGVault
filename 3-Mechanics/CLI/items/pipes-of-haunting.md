# Pipes of Haunting
*Instrument, major, uncommon*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain `dice: 1d3|avg|noform` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn.
