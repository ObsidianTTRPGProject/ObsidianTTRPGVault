# Welcome to Eberron
*In an ancient ruin beneath the Demon Wastes, a band of heroes races to claim the Reaper's Heart. If the agents of the Emerald Claw reach it first, they'll reignite the Last War and unleash an army of undead.*

*In the city of Sharn, a team of spies pulls off an impossible scheme—breaking into the impenetrable vaults of House Kundarak. But instead of gold, they find a secret that could shatter the fragile peace between the nations.*

*Aboard an airship, a wizard debates the interpretation of an ancient prophecy with a blood-red dragon. If the sage loses the argument, the dragon will destroy the airship and everyone on it. But if she wins the debate, the dragon will take them to distant Argonnessen, and no human has ever seen the land of dragons and returned!*

The world of Eberron has a rich history built on heroic deeds, evolving magic, and the wounds of a long, devastating war. Action, adventure, good, evil, and a thousand shades of gray paint the landscape in broad strokes. Ancient mysteries await discovery so they can influence the world and its people.

Magic is built into the very fabric of the world. It pervades everyday life. It provides comforts and conveniences unknown in either the modern world or any world of medieval fantasy. Great cities where castles scrape the sky prosper throughout the continent of Khorvaire, and a thriving aristocracy of merchant families controls much of the world's economy thanks to the edge given them by the mysterious and rare dragonmarks. Its people harness magic as a tool—to build cities, to sail ships through the skies, and to create both wonders and weapons.

Heroes come in all shapes and sizes, all classes and races. They travel the world, battling villains in instants of over-the-top action. And they unearth fabulous treasure, and deal with narrow escapes and ominous mysteries that are as likely to shed light on centuries of secrets as they are to threaten the world's safety.

Eberron embraces swashbuckling action and pulp adventure while adding a layer of noir intrigue. Stories don't always end well, and there isn't a perfect answer to every problem. The Last War turned old allies into bitter enemies and destroyed an entire nation, leaving behind terrible scars. Crime and corruption lurk in the great cities of Khorvaire. Hidden dragons shape the course of history, and sinister fiends influence the dreams of the unwary. Yet mortal greed and ambition might prove more dangerous than any dragon or fiend. This darkness affords opportunities for a group of bold adventurers to make a difference—for better or for worse.

## Using This Book
This book is a gateway to using Eberron as a setting for your D&D campaign. It guides players and the Dungeon Master through the process of creating characters and adventures set in this world.

This introduction presents an overview of the world: its history, its calendar, and the themes that drive it.

**Chapter 1** details how to create Eberron characters. It offers race options and a new class, the artificer, that reflect the flavor of the world. It also presents group patrons, a new concept that adds a shared purpose to your party of adventurers. You can use this material in Eberron or any other D&D setting.

**Chapter 3** focuses on Sharn, the City of Towers. Sharn is one of the wonders of Khorvaire, and a source of endless adventures. This chapter presents a host of interesting locations and activities you can explore in this towering metropolis.

**Chapter 4** provides ideas for adventures in Sharn and beyond. It introduces sinister forces at work in the world, along with the impact of the Last War and the dreadful Day of Mourning. It also includes a short adventure you can use to launch your campaign in Sharn.

**Chapter 5** includes magic items and other treasures for an Eberron campaign. It also explores the vital role of dragonshards.

**Chapter 6** presents new monsters and NPCs drawn from the world of Eberron. From mighty archfiends to helpful homunculi, these creatures add challenges to your adventures in Eberron (or any other D&D world).

## Seven Things to Know
What is Eberron? Here are the key things to know:

**1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of**. The Last War plunged the continent of Khorvaire into civil war more than a century ago, shattering the Five Nations that made up the kingdom of Galifar. Just two years ago, the war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold and the establishment of twelve recognized nations and a tenuous peace. The conflicts, the anger, and the pain of the long war remain, however, and the new nations seek every advantage as they prepare for the next war to break out on the continent.

**2. Dragonmarked Dynasties**. The great dragonmarked families are the barons of industry and commerce throughout Khorvaire and beyond. Their influence transcends political boundaries, and they remained mostly neutral during the Last War. Not technically citizens of any nation, the matriarchs and patriarchs of each house live in splendor within their enclaves and emporiums located throughout Khorvaire. These dynastic houses of commerce derive their power from dragonmarks—hereditary arcane sigils that manifest on certain individuals within the family, granting them limited but useful magical abilities associated with the trade guilds each family controls.

**3. Lands of Intrigue**. The war is over, and the nations of Khorvaire now try to build a new age of peace and prosperity. Ancient threats linger, however, and the world needs heroes to take up the cause. Nations compete on many levels—over economic dominance, political influence, territory, magical power, and more—each looking to maintain or improve its status by any means short of all-out war. Dragonmarked houses, churches both pure and corrupt, crime lords, monster gangs, psionic spies, arcane universities, secret societies, sinister masterminds, dragons, and a multitude of organizations and factions join the struggle for position and power in the aftermath of the Last War.

**4. A Continent of Adventure**. From the jungles of Q'barra to the blasted hills and valleys of the Demon Wastes, from the skyscrapers of Sharn to the dinosaur-filled Talenta Plains, Eberron is a world of adventure. Adventures can draw heroes from one exotic location to another across the continent of Khorvaire. The quest for the Mirror of the Seventh Moon might take the heroes from a hidden mountain shrine in Darguun to a ruined castle in the Shadow Marches and finally to a dungeon deep below the Library of Korranberg. Through the use of magical transportation, heroes can reach a wide range of environments over the course of an adventure, and thus deal with a diverse assortment of monsters and other challenges.

**5. A World of Magic**. The technology of Eberron has developed not through the advance of science but by the mastery of magic. The widespread use of magic pervades life in the cities and towns. Airships and rail transport make rapid travel across the continent possible. A working class of minor mages, called magewrights, uses spells to provide energy and other necessities. Advances in magic item creation have led to everything from self-propelled farming implements to sentient, free-willed beings created in artificers' forges. With the aid of rare crystals called dragonshards, dragonmarks can be made more powerful, elementals can be controlled and harnessed, and magic items can be crafted and shaped.

**6. New Races**. In addition to the common player character races found in the *Player's Handbook*, players can choose to play orc or goblinoid characters in Eberron. Or they can choose one of four new races: changelings, kalashtar, shifters, and warforged. Changelings have minor shapechanging abilities similar to those of doppelgangers. Kalashtar are planar entities merged with human hosts, giving them telepathic abilities. Shifters developed from the mixing of humans and lycanthropes, a union that grants them limited bestial abilities and feral instincts. The warforged are a constructed race created during the Last War, seeking to find its place in a post-war world.

**7. D&D with a Twist**. Every race, monster, spell, and magic item in the *Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual* has a place somewhere in Eberron, but it might not be the place you expect. Eberron has a unique spot in the D&D multiverse, and many familiar elements of the game play different roles in the world. In particular, mortal creatures are products of culture and circumstances, rather than the direct influence of the gods. As a result, you can't assume that a gold dragon is good or a beholder is evil; only in the case of celestials, fiends, and certain other creatures whose identity and worldview are shaped by magic (such as the curse of lycanthropy) is alignment a given.

## History of Eberron
Every child knows the story of the Progenitor Dragons: Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber. In the dawn of time, these three cosmic beings created thirteen planes of existence, each embodying a concept. Their final work was the Material Plane, where all ideas would become manifest: a realm that could know war and peace, life and death, order and chaos. But cruel Khyber sought ultimate dominion over this new reality. She struck Siberys without warning and tore him apart. Eberron wrestled with Khyber and bound the traitor in her coils but could not defeat her. So Eberron became a living prison, a world that would forever contain Khyber's evil.

Almost every culture in the world shares this story as a myth that explains the world. Shattered Siberys became the ring of golden dragonshards wrapped around the planet, said to be the source of magic. Eberron is the world, the source of all natural life. And Khyber is the Underdark and the source of aberrations and fiends, forever struggling against her bonds and yearning to destroy the world above.

Another tale shared across cultures describes one more conflict that occurred in the first age of the world. Long ago, powerful archfiends known as the Overlords and their armies of rakshasa and lesser fiends dominated Eberron. Forces of light—some versions of the story say the nine gods of the Sovereign Host, others say an alliance of dragons and celestials—eventually defeated the Overlords. But these fiends couldn't be destroyed; instead, their immortal essences were bound in Khyber. Whatever the true details of this tale, this much is true: if the Overlords ever break their bonds, the consequences would be catastrophic.

Over the course of millennia, numerous civilizations rose only to fall. Giants built mighty kingdoms on the continent of Xen'drik that were devastated by a war with the dragons of Argonnessen. The goblin empire of Dhakaan ruled Khorvaire until its reign was shattered by an invading army of mind flayers, beholders, and the foul creatures that created them. Today these civilizations are known only through the remnants left behind.

### The Five Nations
In the modern age, the greatest power was the kingdom of Galifar, which covered most of the continent of Khorvaire. The Five Nations—Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, and Cyre—formed the heart of the kingdom. Although each has a unique cultural identity, they share this unified foundation. Families are spread across the Five Nations; the rulers of the Five Nations descend from the Wynarns, the royal bloodline of Galifar. Despite their differences, an Aundairian has more in common with a Thrane than with a Zil gnome or a Lhazaar pirate.

A century ago Galifar collapsed into civil war, and the Five Nations became separate countries at odds with their neighbors. The Last War came to an end after Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm known as the Mourning. The Five Nations remain divided today, sharing Khorvaire with the new nations established by the Treaty of Thronehold. The remaining Five Nations remain the largest and most powerful countries in Khorvaire.

#### The Treaty of Thronehold
The Treaty of Thronehold officially ended the Last War. The treaty recognized the following nations as sovereign states: Aundair, Breland, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, Q'barra, the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, and Zilargo. These nations abide by a common set of laws and maintain diplomatic relations. The Demon Wastes and Shadow Marches regions have no unified government. Droaam has declared itself a nation but has yet to be recognized by the treaty nations.

## Life in Khorvaire
Although Eberron is a vast world with many continents and cultures, your adventures begin in the land of Khorvaire. Here are a few details about everyday life there.

### Languages
In Eberron, languages reflect culture and geography; a dwarf raised in Breland might not know Dwarvish, but a halfling raised in the Mror Holds might. The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script (rather than Dwarvish, as stated in the *Player's Handbook*), because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins.

Common is the language of the Five Nations and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the Shadow Marches typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language (see the Exotic Languages of Eberron table). Members of all races in Xen'drik speak Giant and use it as their trade language. Infernal is the common tongue of all fiends. Infernal is sometimes called "Khyber's Speech," while Celestial is "the tongue of Siberys."

With the DM's approval, you can exchange a language granted by your race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Eberron table. If your halfling was raised in the Mror Holds, you might replace Halfling with Dwarvish to reflect that background. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC. An ogre from Droaam likely speaks Goblin instead of Giant.

##### Standard Languages of Eberron
| Language | Main Speakers | Script |
|---|---|---|
| Common | The Five Nations, trade language of Khorvaire | Common |
| Dwarvish | Mror Holds | Dwarvish |
| Elvish | Aerenal, Valenar | Elvish |
| Giant | Inhabitants of Xen'drik | Giant |
| Gnomish | Zilargo | Dwarvish |
| Goblin | Darguun, Droaam, Shadow Marches, monsters of Khorvaire | Goblin |
| Halfling | Talenta Plains | Common |
| Riedran | People of Sarlona | Common |

##### Exotic Languages of Eberron
| Language | Main Speakers | Script |
|---|---|---|
| Celestial | Celestials | Celestial |
| Daelkyr | Aberrations, denizens of Khyber | Daelkyr |
| Draconic | Dragons, dragonborn | Draconic |
| Infernal | Fiends | Infernal |
| Orc | Isolated orc tribes | Goblin |
| Primordial | Elementals | Primordial |
| Quori | Inspired, kalashtar, quori | Quori |
| Sylvan | Fey creatures | Elvish |

### Names and Surnames
The naming conventions among the people of Khorvaire tend to follow language, rather than being linked to race. A Brelish dwarf who doesn't speak Dwarvish might also carry a name with a human origin rather than a traditional Dwarvish name.

Most citizens of Khorvaire have a given name followed by a surname. A surname associated with the Common language is usually either a family name or related to an occupation or region of origin. So Sorn Fellhorn, Kara of Windshire, and Tellan Magewright are all names you might find among the common folk.

The noble families of Galifar—along with those granted land and titles by one of the sovereigns of the Five Nations—add the prefix ir' to their surname. The name Darro ir'Lain tells you that this individual is a landed noble. The Wynarns were the royal line of Galifar, and the current rulers of Aundair, Breland, and Karrnath are all heirs of the Wynarn bloodline. Thus, Queen Aurala of Aundair is Aurala ir'Wynarn.

Another common prefix is d', used by any heir of a dragonmarked house who has manifested a dragonmark. So Merrix d'Cannith is a member of House Cannith who has manifested the Mark of Making.

### Calendar
In the common calendar of Khorvaire, days are 24 hours long, divided into day and night. Seven days make up a week, four weeks a month, and twelve months a year. The months correspond to the twelve moons of Eberron (see the Eberron Months table), and the prominent moon carries the name of the month in which its orbit brings it closest to the planet.

The seven days of the week, in order, are Sul, Mol, Zol, Wir, Zor, Far, Sar.

The common calendar of Khorvaire tracks the years since the founding of the kingdom of Galifar, using the abbreviation YK. The last king of Galifar, Jarot ir'Wynarn, died on 12 Therendor 894 YK. The Day of Mourning occurred a century later, on 20 Olarune 994 YK. By default, a new Eberron campaign begins on 1 Zarantyr 998 YK.

##### Eberron Months
| Month | Name |
|---|---|
| 1 | Zarantyr (mid-winter) |
| 2 | Olarune (late winter) |
| 3 | Therendor (early spring) |
| 4 | Eyre (mid-spring) |
| 5 | Dravago (late spring) |
| 6 | Nymm (early summer) |
| 7 | Lharvion (mid-summer) |
| 8 | Barrakas (late summer) |
| 9 | Rhaan (early autumn) |
| 10 | Sypheros (mid-autumn) |
| 11 | Aryth (late autumn) |
| 12 | Vult (early winter) |

### Currency
Merchants and nobles use letters of credit to handle large transactions, drawing on the reserves of the dwarven banks of the Mror Holds. But most day-to-day transactions use coins of precious metal. With the collapse of the kingdom of Galifar, each of the Five Nations began to mint its own currency, along with the Mror bankers. However, while the designs imprinted on these coins vary based on the source, each of these factions has continued to use the same metals, weights, and denominations set forth in the days of Galifar, maintaining a simple standard for commerce across Khorvaire.

The copper crown (cp) traditionally depicts the crown of Galifar on one face. The crown is the lowest denomination of coin minted under the rule of Galifar, which spawned the saying, "In Galifar, even the beggars have crowns."

The silver sovereign (sp) bears the face of a living or recent ruler. An unskilled laborer can expect to earn a sovereign for a day's work.

The gold galifar (gp) bears the image of Galifar I, the founder of the old kingdom.

The platinum dragon (pp) bears the image of one of the dragons of legend. With a value of one hundred sovereigns, these coins are used only by the wealthiest citizens of Khorvaire, and the average peasant might never see such a coin.

A number of other coins remain in circulation, such as the double crown of Breland (2 cp) and the silver throne of Cyre (5 sp). However, all the major nations of Khorvaire make use of the four basic coins described above.

## Pulp Adventure
Eberron is a world of swashbuckling adventure. Whether you're a DM developing an adventure in the world or a player preparing to explore it, consider the following elements.

### Exotic Locations
Lightning rails, airships, and other forms of transportation facilitate travel to exotic locations. Adventures could take you to the colossal ruins left behind by the giants of Xen'drik, the warped landscape of the Mournland, or the dark demiplanes within the underworld of Khyber. Even if you prefer to stay in a town, you could explore the mile-high towers of Sharn or the ancient goblin tunnels that lie beneath it.

### Remarkable Heroes
![[000-0-01.png|right|300]]

Eberron is a world in need of heroes. Lingering tensions of war remain. From the fanatics of the Emerald Claw and the mad cults of the Dragon Below to the flesh-warping daelkyr and ancient archfiends, Eberron faces many threats, and few people besides the player characters are able to stop them. The gods are distant and don't directly intervene. The Silver Flame is a divine force of light, but it can act only through mortal champions. The few powerful benevolent NPCs have limitations: the Keeper of the Flame loses her powers if she leaves her citadel. The Great Druid, the spiritual leader of the Eldeen Reaches, is a tree. Most of the powerful people in the world focus on selfish goals. If an angry dragon attacks Sharn, there's no one else to deal with the problem: the fate of the city is in your hands.

Consider a dynamic backstory when developing your character and choosing your background, whether you take a background from the *Player's Handbook* or the house agent background in *chapter 1* of this book. If you take the soldier background, you might have played a role in events of the last few years. What did you do during the Last War? What was your greatest triumph or defeat? If you're a spy, are you a prized agent or did you disavow your organization after they pushed you too far? Don't think of your character as a set of numbers: even at 1st level, you're remarkable in Eberron.

> ##### DM Tip: High Stakes
>What's better than a battle on the deck of an airship? A battle on the deck of an airship that's about to crash! A DM should look for ways to raise the stakes of an Eberron scene, so players feel that every decision matters. This could be driven by the consequences of failure: your actions protect your friends, your house, or your nation. It could involve time: the alarm's been triggered, and you only have 6 rounds before security arrives. Such things can even be incidental. Did you start a fight in an alley behind a bar? Now you notice the drunk ogre sleeping in the shadows. If she wakes up, this could get ugly.
>

### Remarkable Villains
Eberron is rich in villains, from two-bit hoods to continental masterminds. It might be a long time before you're ready to face the sinister leader behind the Order of the Emerald Claw in battle. But part of the flavor of pulp adventure includes recurring villains who closely match the heroes—rivals who advance in power as you do.

To create a compelling villain, the DM and players might develop a villain's backstory together. A DM might ask a player: *When you fought in the Last War, Halas Martain served in your unit until he betrayed you. What did he do, exactly?* Likewise, when a pulp villain appears to die, they can devise remarkable escapes from death. Perhaps Halas had a ring that cast an illusion of his death while stabilizing him or cast *feather fall* when he leapt from that tower in Sharn. A DM could engage the players in determining the answer: *It's Halas Martain, all right. How do you think he survived your last encounter?* This collaboration can produce a compelling story and a sense of investment in the world.

## Noir Intrigue
Eberron draws inspiration from noir and hard-boiled fiction. It's a world where stories don't always end well, and where there isn't a perfect solution for every problem. In developing characters or stories in Eberron, consider the following concepts.

### Everyone Has Regrets
Player characters are remarkable people, but they aren't perfect. As you consider a flaw for your character, you can add a little hard-boiled flavor by considering the past: Did you make a tragic mistake, and if so, is it something you can ever undo? Did you hurt or betray someone who now seeks revenge? The Regrets table provides a few examples of missteps that might haunt you.

##### Regrets
| d10 | Regret |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | While you were serving in the Last War, you were forced to abandon an injured comrade. You don't know if they survived. |
| 2 | You placed your faith in a lover who betrayed you. You don't know if you can ever trust anyone again. |
| 3 | You murdered a rival. Your actions may have been justified, but their face still haunts you. |
| 4 | You made a promise to a child or a lover that you failed to keep. |
| 5 | You squandered your family's fortune and brought shame and ruin to your household. |
| 6 | You made a bargain with an extraplanar entity that you now regret. |
| 7 | You abandoned your family to pursue a life of adventure. Your village was destroyed in the war and you don't know if they survived. |
| 8 | You engaged in covert operations for a nation as a spy or soldier. While you were serving your country, you did unforgivable things. |
| 9 | Someone put their trust in you and you betrayed them for personal gain. You might regret it now, but you can never repair the damage you've done. |
| 10 | You volunteered for mystical experiments. These may be responsible for your class abilities, but you might experience side effects. |

#### Why Do You Need 200 Gold Pieces?
A regret helps shape your personality as an element of your past that plays an ongoing role in your story. But perhaps you have a problem that needs to be resolved right now. Another way to define a character's flaw is to roll on the Debts table.

Why would you want to take on a debt? The obligation adds depth to a character and provides a compelling, immediate motive for adventuring—you're not just out to get rich; you need gold to get that bounty off your head. It's also an opportunity to establish an element that can be part of a character moving forward. If you're trying to reclaim a magic item from a pawnshop, you declare that your character once owned that magic item—an heirloom, something you created, or a gift from a mentor—you've just temporarily lost it. If you're trying to raise money to join a secret society, it suggests that membership in this organization may be a part of the story later on.

Establishing a debt requires collaboration and approval by both player and DM. Work together to develop the details: Who's blackmailing you? Which secret society are you trying to join? What's the story behind the magic item you've pawned, and what sort of item is it? You can present ideas, but the DM has final approval.

##### Debts
| d10 | Debt |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | You committed a crime during the Last War, and now you're being blackmailed by someone who has proof. You can justify your actions, but the law won't care. |
| 2 | You've got a gambling problem. If you can't repay Daask (see *chapter 3*), you're going to be playing tag with a cockatrice. |
| 3 | You own an uncommon magic item, but you had to sell it to a pawn shop. If you can't reclaim it within the month, they'll sell it off. |
| 4 | You were making a delivery on behalf of the Boromar Clan (see *chapter 3*) and you lost the merchandise. |
| 5 | Someone knows the whereabouts of a sibling or loved one you thought lost in the Mourning, but that information is going to cost you. |
| 6 | You have a degenerative disease that can't be cured by mundane means. If you can't get a lesser restoration soon, you're going to start showing symptoms. |
| 7 | Your family lost everything in the Last War. You could get them a stake in a new farm, inn, or stagecoach with 200 gp. |
| 8 | You've got a price on your head. Until you settle things with House Tharashk, you'd better keep an eye out for bounty hunters. |
| 9 | You have an opportunity to join an influential secret society. But you've got only one month to raise the membership dues. |
| 10 | Roll again. It's not your debt: it's your lover's problem. Can you solve the problem before they have to face the consequences? |

### Personal Motives
Not every conflict involves a fight between light and darkness. The vast majority of people are driven by simple motives: greed, fear, pride, or ambition. One person just wants to get some gold in their pocket. Another wants to impress a paramour. A leader guiding their nation into war is motivated both by fear of their neighbors and the sincere belief that Khorvaire would be better off under their rule.

Primordial forces strive to change or destroy Eberron. But more often, characters encounter misguided patriots, religious extremists, dragonmarked houses looking to wring a few more pieces of gold out of Khorvaire, spies who will do anything to protect their nations, and petty criminals trying to build empires. Eberron holds a place for selfless heroes and truly vile villains, as well as everyone in between.

### Shades of Gray
In Eberron, it's not always easy to separate the heroes from the villains. Good people can do terrible things, while cruel or heartless people might serve the greater good. An inquisitor might torture innocents in a quest to root out a cult of the Dragon Below; if she's stopped, the cult will survive and flourish. A group of orcs periodically raids a human settlement because the settlers built their village on land sacred to the orcs and are disrupting wards that hold evil at bay. The heroes find a powerful magic weapon in a tomb, but the artifact is the sword of an ancient hobgoblin general, whose descendants want it back. The ways to resolve these problems aren't always simple.

Certain situations demand straightforward decisions. If Emerald Claw cultists are about to detonate a necrotic resonator that will kill half of Sharn, they need to be stopped. But in a good Eberron story, the simplest solution may not be the best one.

### Something to Lose
In a noir story, things don't necessarily end well. But any adventure carries a risk of death or failure, so what additional factors might be at risk for the characters? They should have something to lose beyond hit points, vulnerabilities not reflected in game statistics: fear of a tarnished reputation, a threat to a friend or lover, a favorite business destroyed or taken over. Character relationships require players to invest in the story and work best when the DM and player collaborate to develop details (the *group patrons* in chapter 1 provide a framework for fleshing out such details).

A DM who introduces an old buddy who served with the player characters during the war could describe the person and then ask each player to define a connection to them. Present each player with a prompt: *Player one, how did Smitty save your life? Player two, you and Smitty were both in a prison camp; how did you escape?* The answers to these questions provide details to use in a campaign, and they give the players a personal investment, which makes it more significant when the Emerald Claw targets Smitty for assassination!

## A Magical World
The Five Nations were built on a magical foundation. To them, magic is a form of science, which can be studied and taught. Nevertheless, few people possess the skill required to become a wizard or an artificer, and high-level magic remains rare. Resurrection and teleportation aren't part of everyday life, but citizens harness lesser effects and use them for the common good.

Artisans called magewrights provide much of this magic. Compared to a wizard or an artificer, a magewright's knowledge of magic is narrow: a locksmith might master the *arcane lock* and *knock* spells to supplement the use of physical tools; a magewright healer could cast *lesser restoration* and *cure wounds* in addition to using healer's kits and the Medicine skill. A magewright's casting is also slow and expensive: they typically cast their spells as rituals. They are artisans, not adventurers, and the prosperity of the Five Nations was built on their foundation.

Game statistics are given for magewrights in *chapter 6*, including how much it costs them to cast a spell of 1st level or higher. In chapter 2, prices are given for magewright services in the city of Sharn, but those prices can be used elsewhere in the world as well.

### Dragonmarked Dynasties
Powerful dynastic guilds dominate and regulate the magical economy. The dragonmarked houses include barons of industry whose influence rivals that of monarchs. Their power derives from their dragonmarks: magical sigils passed down through their bloodlines. For example, House Jorasco dominates the medical trade with its Mark of Healing, while only someone with House Lyrandar's Mark of Storms can pilot an airship.

Even independent businesses are typically licensed by a house and conform to the standards it sets. Not every tavern is run by House Ghallanda, but the Ghallanda seal in the corner of an inn sign assures customers that the establishment meets health and safety standards.

*Chapter 1* contains more details about dragonmarks and the dragonmarked houses, along with rules for creating dragonmarked characters.

### Communication
The Courier's Guild of House Orien operates a mail service, carrying messages and packages across Khorvaire by horse and the house's lightning rail. Sending a letter by mail is inexpensive; sending a package or a message by way of a courier is more secure but more expensive.

If security is particularly important, House Sivis can protect written messages using magic, such as the *illusory script* spell, and House Kundarak can secure packages with the *glyph of warding* spell.

The gnomes of House Sivis also maintain a network of *speaking stones* (described in *chapter 5*) to facilitate instantaneous communication across long distances. Short messages pass from one stone to another one within a network of message stations.

The Communication and Security Services table shows typical prices.

##### Communication and Security Services
| Service | Cost |
|---|---|
| *Arcane lock* (House Kundarak) | 20 gp |
| Courier service (House Orien) | 1 sp per mile |
| *Glyph of warding* (House Kundarak) | 350 gp |
| *Illusory script* (House Sivis) | 15 gp |
| Mail service (House Orien) | 1 cp per mile |
| Message station (House Sivis) | 2 sp per word |
| Translation (House Sivis) | 2 cp per word |

### Convenience
In the cities of Khorvaire, magic provides a host of minor conveniences. *Everbright lanterns* (described in *chapter 5*) light the streets. A chef heats a pot of stew with a whispered incantation, while magic amplifies a town crier's voice. The various effects produced by *prestidigitation*—heating, cooling, cleaning, and minor illusion—all enhance daily life in the cities.

### Entertainment and Fashion
Theaters employ cantrips to amplify sound and focus lighting. Grander performances incorporate illusions, creating special effects to thrill audiences, and other spells allow actors to perform amazing stunts. Dream parlors focus on entirely illusory entertainment.

Those with the inclination to display their wealth wear *glamerweave*, clothing imbued with illusion (presented in chapter 5). This can involve moving images, such as a cloak lined with glittering stars or a gown with a pattern of flames; the wearer might even adjust the intensity of these flames with a word. Expensive *glamerweave* can produce more elaborate effects, such as a gown that appears to be made of blooming flowers. *Glamerweave* can also create abstract effects that slowly shift colors or shimmer with a subtle glow.

### Medicine
The dragonmarked House Jorasco maintains houses of healing across Khorvaire. The simplest service is the expert application of the Medicine skill. For those with desperate need and gold to pay, most Jorasco outposts can provide *lesser restoration*; the best healers can also provide *greater restoration*. In the finest Jorasco enclaves, it's even possible to raise the dead.

The Healing Services table summarizes typical prices for the services provided by House Jorasco.

##### Healing Services
| Service | Cost |
|---|---|
| Minor nonmagical care | 3 sp per use of the Medicine skill |
| Major nonmagical care | 1 gp per day |
| *Cure wounds* | 25 gp per level of the spell |
| *Lesser restoration* | 50 gp |
| *Remove curse* | 75 gp |
| *Greater restoration* | 150 gp |
| *Raise dead* | 750 gp |

### Transportation
![[001-0-02.png|right|300]]

An excellent system of roads connects the central nations of Khorvaire. Travelers can always make their way by horse or coach, which might employ draft animals magebred by House Vadalis for speed or endurance. House Vadalis also supplies exotic mounts such as hippogriffs and griffons. Elemental galleons use bound air or water elementals to propel them.

Two main options provide long-distance travel across land. Major cities in Khorvaire are linked by the lightning rail of House Orien, which allows you to avoid the perils—and tedium—of the roads. The lightning rail uses bound elementals to pull a train of carriages over a path of magical stones, between which a rail-like stream of lightning arcs.

If speed is an issue, you can book passage on a House Lyrandar airship, which uses a bound elemental to hold a ship aloft and propel it through the air. This is almost the fastest way to travel, but also the most expensive. Elemental airships are a recent innovation and are relatively rare; many cities don't yet have docking towers.

For those with no time to spare and plenty of money to spend, House Orien also has teleportation circles in each of its enclaves in cities across Khorvaire. At significant cost, a member of the house will transport passengers instantaneously from one enclave to another.

The Travel Services table summarizes the cost of traveling by these extraordinary means.

##### Travel Services
| Service | Cost | Speed |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Airship (House Lyrandar) | 1 gp per mile | 20 mph |
| Elemental galleon (House Lyrandar) | 5 sp per mile | 10 mph |
| Lightning rail, standard (House Orien) | 2 sp per mile | 30 mph |
| Lightning rail, first class (House Orien) | 5 sp per mile | 30 mph |
| Lightning rail, steerage (House Orien) | 3 cp per mile | 30 mph |
| Magebred coach (House Orien) | 3 sp per mile | 5 mph |
| *Teleportation circle* (House Orien) | 2,500 gp | Instant |

### Warfare
After a century of war, magic plays an ever-increasing role on the battlefield. Massive magical siege staffs fill the role of artillery. Semi-sentient warforged titans can scatter squads of infantry. Arcane sappers may spread *glyphs of warding* to deny a region to an enemy. Wands and rods haven't replaced the swords or bows, but elite wandslingers, as military spellcasters are often known, are becoming ever more common.

The nations of Khorvaire all employed different forms of battle magic during the war. Aundair fielded the greatest number of wizards, while Breland produced floating fortresses and other engines of war. The nation of Karrnath embraced the practice of necromancy and animated hordes of undead soldiers.

In the final decades of the war, House Cannith created the warforged: tireless soldiers formed of metal and other materials. The Treaty of Thronehold forbade the creation of new warforged and granted freedom to those that survived the conflict. Warforged now seek places to call home across Khorvaire, but these living weapons struggle to find their place in a world at peace.

## The Last War
![[002-0-03.png|right|300]]

For hundreds of years, the continent of Khorvaire was united under the kingdom of Galifar. This peace came to an end with the death of King Jarot in 894 YK, just over a century ago. Conflict over the succession spiraled into outright war between the Five Nations.

The Last War was a bitter struggle that forever changed the shape of Khorvaire. It was a century marked by shifting alliances, with years of stalemate interspersed with periods of intense battles. This grueling conflict left deep scars on the land and the people, but there was worse to come. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre was consumed in a magical cataclysm now known as the Mourning. The cause of the Mourning remains unknown; many fear it was caused by unbridled use of war magic. Shock and fear brought the nations to the negotiating table, and the Last War came to an end in 996 YK with the Treaty of Thronehold.

Although many celebrated the end of the war, others remain unsatisfied with its outcome. No one won the war. Even though people optimistically refer to it as the Last War, most believe that it's only a matter of time until conflict begins anew. The mystery of the Mourning is the only thing holding the warmongers at bay. If someone uncovers the secret of the Mourning—if it can be proven that the Mourning can't happen again, or if its power could be harnessed as a weapon—war could erupt again. Until then, the nations remain in a cold war as each makes preparations and seeks advantages in a conflict that could lie ahead.

### The Scars of War
As of 1 Zarantyr 998 YK, it's been less than four years since the Mourning and less than two years since the Last War came to an end. The Last War spanned the continent and lasted for over a century. Most people want to move on. But the scars of decades of war can't be erased so quickly. These are just a few of the ongoing effects of the Last War.

#### Dragonmarked Power
The dragonmarked houses remained neutral in the war and made considerable profit selling their services to all sides. War drives innovation; House Cannith developed many new weapons during the war, including the warforged. House Lyrandar perfected its airships in the last decade of the conflict. Rumors persist of monsters or super soldiers developed by House Vadalis or biological weapons in the hands of House Jorasco.

The dragonmarked houses emerged from the war stronger than ever, with the divided nations dependent on their services. Before the Last War, united Galifar imposed many restrictions on the houses. Today, no monarch can afford to break ties with any of the dragonmarked houses. What will happen if one of the houses goes too far in its pursuit of profit?

#### New Nations
Before the Last War, Galifar laid claim to all Khorvaire. Several new states emerged over the course of the war. In some cases, this was largely a formality; Galifar never had a strong grip on the Lhazaar Principalities or the gnome nation of Zilargo, and they held the Demon Wastes in name only. Other states were born in violence: the elves of Valenar and the goblins of Darguun seized their realms by force. But Aundair yearns to reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, Breland keeps a wary eye on the monstrous kingdom of Droaam, and many mistrust the Valenar elves. Within the Five Nations, anger remains over how the final lines were drawn; for example, Thrane retains control of the ancient Aundairian city of Thaliost, seized during the war.

#### Physical Damage
The borders between nations demonstrate the impact of generations of conflict. Forests and farmlands scorched by fire and magic are still recovering. Ruined cities have yet to be reclaimed, along with shattered villages and abandoned fortresses. These deserted sites now provide shelter for brigands or are haunted by the restless spirits of those who died in anguish.

This damage reached far beyond the front lines. Magic-fueled weapons, aerial cavalry, and guerrilla forces all struck deep within enemy territory, and the cities of Khorvaire suffered. Wherever you go, you might see the scorch marks of fireballs or wreckage from siege weapons. Every nation is working to repair these wounds, but the damage could linger for generations.

As you create an Eberron character, consider your roots and the impact of the war. Was your hometown destroyed in the war? Is your family thriving, or were its members scattered or slain during the conflict?

#### Refugees and Shortages
Refugees live in every major city, including tens of thousands of exiles produced by Cyre's destruction. Cyrans are a people without a homeland, seeking shelter and sustenance in the lands of their former enemies. Many Cyran refugees are former soldiers who were fighting in enemy territory when the Mourning struck, or they were farmers and merchants who escaped before their nation was consumed. Former nobles now have nothing but rags, and scholars or artists live in alleyways.

Cities and towns still suffer from shortages in the aftermath of the war. Farmlands, workers, and the resources devoted to the war were lost. Nations are recovering, and most essential services and goods are available in major cities. But there is always the possibility that something you want—a luxury item or a spell component—simply isn't available or can be acquired only through the black market.

### The Mourning
The nation of Cyre was once the heart of the kingdom of Galifar. The Last War took a heavy toll on Cyre and its citizens, as the nation became a primary battleground where the Five Nations crossed swords. But no one was prepared for the disaster that struck in 994 YK.

Accounts of the Mourning vary. Some say that a blinding light engulfed the battlefield near the Saerun Road. Others say that dead-gray mists rose in the capital city of Metrol and spread from there. Within the space of one day, the nation of Cyre had been engulfed in a wall of mist, and anything caught within the mists was horrifically transformed. Over a million Cyrans were killed on the day of Mourning. Those who survived were soldiers fighting in enemy territory, those living on the borders who were able to flee from the advancing mists, and those few who were able to escape the interior through magical means. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre ceased to exist.

The Mourning threw Khorvaire into a state of shock. Who could unleash such power? Was this a weapon, and if so, when would those responsible issues their demands? Were the borders of the lingering walls of mist stable, or could they expand at any moment? What was to be done with the Cyran refugees surging into every adjacent nation? Fear of the Mourning ended the war. But all those questions remain unanswered.

Breland opened its borders to refugees, and Prince Oargev serves as de facto ruler in the area now called New Cyre. Despite its grand name, New Cyre is little more than a vast refugee camp. Other refugees scattered across Khorvaire; some are treated with pity, others with suspicion or anger. And fear of the Mourning hangs like a shadow across Khorvaire. Could it happen again? Is this how the world ends?

#### The Mournland
A wall of dead-gray mist surrounds the remnants of Cyre. Beyond the mists lies a land twisted by magic, a wound that will not heal. The blasted land is strangely transformed. In some places, the ground has fused into jagged glass. In others, it is cracked and burned. Broken bodies of soldiers from various sides litter the landscape—soldiers whose dead bodies refuse to decompose. The Mournland is a vast open grave.

In that horrific landscape, vile magical effects linger, and monsters mutate into even more foul and horrible creatures. Magical effects continue to rain upon the land as storms that never dissipate. Stories speak of living spells—war magic that has taken physical form, sentient fireballs and vile cloudkills that endlessly search for new victims. And angry ghosts continue to fight their final battles.

The only thing predictable about the Mournland is that nothing is predictable; any sort of monster or horror could lurk within its borders. And yet it also holds the wealth and treasures of an entire nation, along with the secrets of House Cannith and everything else that was left behind. It's dangerous. It's mysterious. But it's also a dungeon the size of a nation, with opportunities for those brave enough to enter the mists.

#### The Mourning and You
In making an Eberron character, think about the impact the Mourning had on you. If you're from Cyre, did you lose all your family and friends? Are there heirlooms lost in the mists that you're determined to regain, or loved ones you hope to someday see again? Do you feel loyalty to your nation and hope to see it restored, or have you burned Cyre out of your heart?

Even if you're not from Cyre, the Mourning may have had a profound impact on you. Are you afraid that the Mourning could consume all of Khorvaire, or do you prefer not to dwell on such things? If you're religious, did the shocking tragedy of the Mourning cause you to question your faith, or did it reinforce it? If you're an artificer or a wizard, are you interested in studying its effects more closely. Might you even hope to unravel its mysteries yourself? Do you see it solely as a tragedy, or do you hope that this awesome power could somehow be harnessed?

Perhaps you were caught in the Mourning and survived the experience, but its effects remain with you. Consider the following aftereffects of your experience:

- As a barbarian, you could have been a simple peasant caught in the Mourning. Everyone else in your community was killed, but their spirits were bound to you. Your barbarian rage represents you channeling these vengeful ghosts. Is there a way to lay these spirits to rest? Do they have unfinished business they want you to resolve?
- As a sorcerer, your magical powers could be the result of your exposure to the Mourning. Were you physically transformed as well, or are your powers the only manifestation of the Mourning? Are you comfortable using your abilities, or are you afraid that you might be increasing the power of the Mourning with each spell you cast?
- As a warlock, your patron could be interested in the Mourning and drive you to learn more about it. Your patron could even be part of the Mourning—perhaps a collective of spirits killed on the Day of Mourning, or a dark and enigmatic power that might have been responsible for this tragedy. If you take the latter approach, do you feel that by using your warlock magic you are serving the Mourning? Or do you believe that you siphon power from it and weaken it with your actions?
- As a member of an unusual race, you could say that you are actually a creation of the Mourning. Perhaps your dragonborn was an actual dragon transformed on the day of Mourning. Or maybe your tiefling is touched by the dark power of the Mourning instead of by an infernal power.

#### What Caused the Mourning?
A DM running an Eberron campaign can decide the cause of the Mourning or leave it as a mystery that will never be solved. People in Eberron have many theories about the cause of the Mourning. It's up to the DM to decide if any of them are correct:

- The Mourning was the result of a century of extensive use of war magic. If the nations continue to use this magic, the Mourning will expand.
- The dragonmarked House Cannith made a fortune selling magical weapons to all sides during the Last War. The Mourning was caused by research gone horribly awry. The secrets can be found in a Cannith research facility within the Mournland. If this knowledge could be recovered and refined, it could produce a terrifying weapon.
- The Mourning was triggered by the release of an ancient demon overlord trapped since the dawn of time. This mighty fiend is lurking in the Mournland and building its power, but soon it will be ready to act.

A DM should consider whether the mystery of the Mourning can be solved and what the consequences would be. Right now, fear of the Mourning holds war at bay. If it's confirmed that the Mourning is no longer a threat—or if one nation manages to harness its power—war could begin again.

## The Draconic Prophecy
![[003-0-04.png|right|300]]

There are patterns hidden in the world. Secrets lie in the conjunctions of the planes and moons, in strange symbols formed by the flowing lava of a volcanic eruption or the fissures caused by an earthquake. Carved in the walls of ancient citadels and on primeval megaliths, knot patterns appear to have meaning that only the contemplative mind can hope to comprehend. To those who can read them, these myriad events and signs form a map of possible futures, a map that can be used to shape the course of history.

Scholars call this map the Draconic Prophecy, attributing it to the Progenitor Dragons: Eberron, Siberys, and Khyber. The Prophecy is vast and complex, its signs scattered across the world. Few humans or even elves have the time or resources to unravel its secrets. The foremost students of the Prophecy are ancient dragons, immortal fiends, and others who have devoted thousands of years to this work.

What makes the Prophecy especially complex is that it doesn't define a singular path for the future. Rather, the Prophecy is a map that shows many possible futures, along with the steps that must occur to make that future a reality. A fragment of the Prophecy might say, "If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his nation." The "Bear King" could refer to King Boranel of Breland, since the bear is Breland's heraldic beast. The "Shadow of the Mourning" could mean that Boranel must be slain in the Mournland, or it could mean that the assassination must occur on the anniversary of the Mourning. This passage doesn't say that Boranel will be assassinated or that the Brelish monarchy will fall; it suggests that if Boranel is assassinated under these conditions, then the monarchy will surely fall. But it could also be fulfilled in different ways, if the terms of the Prophecy are interpreted differently. Other fragments of the Prophecy might cover what happens if Boranel is assassinated under other circumstances, or what happens if he dies of natural causes.

As an adventurer, you could be hired by a scholar trying to piece together a fragment of the Prophecy and clash with a secret society along the way. Or you could discover that your family plays a pivotal role in a fragment of the Prophecy. Will you embrace this or fight your potential destiny? Will you dedicate your life to interpreting the Prophecy or ignore it as just a bunch of mystical nonsense? And might the Prophecy hold the answer to the Mourning itself?

# Chapter 1: Character Creation
The skyscrapers of Sharn rise up before you, the spires glimmering with magical lights. Or wind rushes through your hair as the airship you're riding races toward adventure in the jungles of Q'barra. Or you hunt Emerald Claw agents on the lightning rail, creeping through one train car after another. Or you chart another adventurous course on the war-torn continent of Khorvaire. Whatever path your character takes in Eberron, consider how the world affects your character.

![[004-1-01.jpg|right|300]](With a homunculus on her shoulder, the gnome artificer Vi brandishes her Arcane Firearm, as a heavily armored warforged stands guard.)

Building on the book's introduction, this chapter reveals how you can create a character shaped by Eberron and its war-filled history. The chapter offers you the following choices:

**Race**. Choose one of the playable races detailed in this chapter, or pick a race from the *Player's Handbook* and learn here how Eberron has affected that species' development.

**Dragonmark**. Decide whether your character bears one of the mystical marks associated with the dragonmarked houses.

**Background**. Choose the house agent background if your character has devoted themself to serving a dragonmarked house.

**Artificer**. You have the option of choosing the artificer as your character's class, becoming an unmatched magical inventor.

**Group Patron**. Working with the other players in your group, decide which of the great powers in the world backs your group. This decision can shape your entire campaign.

## Races
Humanoids of all kinds have made their mark on the continent of Khorvaire. Presented in alphabetical order, the playable races in this section have especially shaped the land's recent history.

Each of the races described in the *Player's Handbook* has a place in Eberron. As you make a character from one of these races, this section can help you understand your character's place in the world.

This section also presents other playable races that have performed important roles in the world's evolution:

**Changelings** are clever shapechangers who can disguise themselves as other people.

**Goblinoids**—bugbears, goblins, and hobgoblins—ruled Khorvaire long ago, before the madness of the daelkyr undermined them. After serving as mercenaries in the Last War, they now seek a place in the world's new order.

**Kalashtar** are humanoids bound to spirits from the plane of dreams, imbued with wisdom and telepathic talent.

**Orcs**, along with their half-orc kin, are a fierce people who have fought world-threatening evils for centuries.

**Shifters** draw on their distant lycanthropic heritage to manifest bestial traits for short periods of time.

**Warforged** are artificial lifeforms built to fight in the Last War. Created as tools of battle, they now seek a place and purpose beyond war.

## Changelings
See the Changeling entry.

## Dragonborn
*When the jungle's hidden darkness stirs, the children of the dragon will scatter into shadow, keeping their eternal watch. *— The Draconic Prophecy, as recorded in the *Mar'saval Scrolls*Tens of thousands of years ago, the dragons of Argonnessen established a garrison of dragonborn in what is now Q'barra. These warriors were assigned to protect the region against the influence of the Lords of Dust. Over time they drifted away from their duties, building a nation in eastern Khorvaire and clashing with the goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire.

This dragonborn nation came crashing down when one of the ancient fiendish Overlords stirred, unleashing fiends and corrupting many of the dragonborn themselves. Their nation in ruins, the dragonborn retreated to the darkness of Q'barra. They have remained there ever since, guarding against corruption and fighting the evil forces of the Poison Dusk—which is sometimes described as a cult devoted to a dragon, and sometimes as an army gathering in the name of a fiendish Overlord.

To date the dragonborn have largely ignored the humans of Q'barra, and the few humans who've encountered dragonborn believe they're some exotic type of lizardfolk. If you're a dragonborn, what has caused you to emerge from Q'barra? Are you on a quest to help your people or to oppose the Lords of Dust? Are you driven by wanderlust or curiosity? Did you serve as a mercenary in the Last War? How might your travels tie to the fate of your people?

## Dwarves
![[006-1-03.png|right|300]](Dwarf with a Tentacle Whip)

*Gold is the gift of the mountains, but iron comes from blood and bone.*— Mror ProverbThe origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from "a land of endless ice." Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.

Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm below—which was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.

### Dwarves of the Mror Holds
The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions—strange symbiotic items (some of which appear in *chapter 5*) that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.

Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element of your character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.

Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.

##### Leaving the Mror Holds
| d8 | Reason for Leaving |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A feud with a rival clan has gotten out of hand, and it's best that you spend a few decades away from the Holds while things cool down. |
| 2 | You come from a large family and there's no room for you to shine in your hold, so you hope to make a name for yourself in the wider world. |
| 3 | Your clan has arranged your marriage and your future, and you've decided to have a few adventures before you settle down. |
| 4 | You're pursuing a vendetta with a personal rival, seeking to defeat them either in battle or in business. |
| 5 | You're searching for a legendary dwarven artifact, stolen centuries ago by a Karrnish noble. |
| 6 | You want to assemble champions who can help you explore the ancient ruins beneath your ancestral home. |
| 7 | You've rejected your clan's attitude toward daelkyr magic, earning the enmity of powerful dwarves. |
| 8 | You want to understand how the other peoples of Khorvaire—especially the goblins and orcs—have fought the daelkyr. |

### Dwarves of the Five Nations
Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes—and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.

When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?

### Dwarves and Dragonmarks
The Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.

In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.

## Elves
*Put up your swords and talk of peace, or hide behind your walls of stone. When the host of Valenar thunders forth, neither will save you.*— Shaeras Vadallia, High King of ValenarTens of thousands of years ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow—assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.

Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The drow, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.

As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship with the past: Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?

### High Elves: The Aereni
![[007-1-04.png|right|300]](Aereni Elf with a Symbol of the Undying Court)

For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.

The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war, so why would any sensible elf venture into that madness? As you make an Aereni elf character, decide what has caused you to leave your island home and the protection of the Undying Court in order to wander the world. Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court? Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors? Or are you an exile, banished from your homeland for some crime against your people's rulers?

Consider your character's personal and family history. What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills? Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what's your relationship with them? Do you find it challenging to deal with the short-lived races, or are you patient with them?

### Wood Elves: The Tairnadal
![[008-1-05.png|right|300]](Tairnadal Elf in Vulkoori Armor)

Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars—against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.

The Tairnadal have three distinct lines: the Draleus Tairn, the Silaes Tairn, and the Valaes Tairn. All three lines roam the northern plains of Aerenal, having left the forest long ago, but the Valaes Tairn now reside mostly in Valenar, being the Tairnadal most often encountered in Khorvaire. Despite sharing a homeland with the Aereni, the Tairnadal have distinct religious traditions, revering their patron ancestors rather than the Undying Court.

In creating a Tairnadal character, including a Valenar elf, think about your patron ancestor. Most Tairnadal pursue the same class as their patron, so if your character is a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. Was your ancestor a famous blademaster, a stealthy hunter, or a war chanter? Were they chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their path, it is your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Do you know another elf with the same patron ancestor, and what's your relationship to that character? Do you know an elf whose patron ancestor was a bitter rival of yours?

Also consider why you are traveling with a group of player characters (who are presumably not also members of your war band) instead of serving with the Tairnadal. Do you experience visions of your patron ancestor driving you on a particular course? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors your ancestor's legendary deeds? Are you seeking vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?

### Elves of the Five Nations
Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there. Many of the finest wizards and most renowned artisans in the Five Nations are high elves. Wood elves are found among the rangers and druids of the Eldeen Reaches and stalking the darkest alleys of Sharn.

As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions of your ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.

Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?

### Drow of Xen'drik
Long ago on the continent of Xen'drik, the first drow fought beside the giants against the other elves. Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.

When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.

Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.

When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?

How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member of your adventuring party.

### Elves and Dragonmarks
The Mark of Shadow first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.

Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the Mark of Shadow appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Blades—an espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings (see *chapter 2*).

## Gnomes
*Five words can defeat a thousand swords.*— Zil proverbThe average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words—whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.

### Gnomes of Zilargo
To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some of which persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals—of which there are many—often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.

Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.

When you're making a Zil gnome character, consider what kinds of schemes you or your family might be involved in. The Zil Schemes table offers some suggestions, but you should feel free to elaborate on these schemes, even to absurd extremes.

##### Zil Schemes
| d10 | Scheme |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Your family is working on a new form of elemental binding, but they need a lot of Khyber dragonshards. |
| 2 | You have an anonymous contact who sends you missions via the *sending* spell. When you do as you're asked, you receive handsome rewards. |
| 3 | You've inherited a plot of land in Q'barra. If you don't visit within a year, you'll lose the claim. |
| 4 | Due to an unusual twist of Triumvirate law, you share the same name with a number of other Zil, and you're all legally considered to be the same person. |
| 5 | You've acquired a *spellshard* (described in *chapter 5*) that contains a vast amount of text in a strange code. |
| 6 | You know the location of a wanted war criminal, and you've been trying to decide whether to turn them in or try to get something in exchange for your silence. |
| 7 | You've been selling false treasure maps, but now you've found one that might be real. |
| 8 | You've acquired a controlling stake in a dragonshard mine, which was abandoned long ago. But why? Kobolds? Aberrations? There's only one way to find out! |
| 9 | Your family is facing financial ruin, and they've taken out a life insurance policy on you. It only pays out if you die under unusual circumstances, and they're encouraging you to seek out more dangerous adventures. |
| 10 | You're peddling a life-extension scheme where clients are petrified by a medusa and then restored later. |

![[009-1-06.png|right|300]](Zil Gnome)

Additionally, consider your relationship to Zilargo: why you have left, and what ties do you still have to it? Your scheme could provide a good reason for you to leave. Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories of your adventures back to the *Korranberg Chronicle*. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in Zilargo. If you are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent—gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.

***Zil Names.*** Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims "the sweetest song is the name of a friend." Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.

### Gnomes of the Five Nations
As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from Zilargo into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.

As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.

### Gnomes and Dragonmarks
The Mark of Scribing appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.

Today, House Sivis provides avenues of communication across Khorvaire. Translation, mediation, interpreting, and legal advocacy all fall within House Sivis's broad purview, and they maintain the network of message stations that allow cross-continent communication.

## Goblinoids
![[010-1-07.png|right|300]]

*Hoisting the head by the fading plumes of the ruined helmet, still tied under the chin by a cord, Haruuc raised it in one hand and his bloody sword in the other. "Your lord is dead!" he howled in the human language. "The battle is done! By my sword, I claim this place and name it Rhukaan Draal, the crown city of Darguun, the land of the people!"*— Don Bassingthwaite, *The Doom of Kings*The goblinoid species—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—were once the dominant civilization in Khorvaire, with the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan ruling the continent for thousands of years. It was crippled by a long conflict with the daelkyr and their aberrant armies; even though the daelkyr were defeated, the seeds of madness took root in the empire and tore it apart. Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.

### City Goblins
Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblins are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblins can be found in all walks of life, and goblins served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War.

### The Ghaal'dar
The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun (see *chapter 2*). The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.

As a Ghaal'dar goblinoid, you hold your place through cunning and strength. You may have been a former mercenary now seeking adventure. You could be working as an emissary for one of the Ghaal'dar tribes or even Lhesh Haruuc himself. Or you could have been driven from your tribe by the actions of a rival; perhaps you're seeking allies to reclaim your birthright.

### The Marguul
The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal'dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun. They are infamous raiders, and while they have brokered a truce with the Ghaal'dar, anyone venturing into the Seawall Mountains had best travel with a Marguul guide.

As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.

### The Heirs of Dhakaan
Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.

The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent. Their weaponsmiths are superior even to the artificers of House Cannith, and they are experts in the working of adamantine and other exotic metals. Anyone who presumes to look down upon goblinoids should be surprised by the skills of the Dhakaani.

The Heirs of Dhakaan are an agnostic society and don't have clerics, paladins, or druids. Their focus is on martial excellence, and their spiritual leaders are bards, who tell tales of past glory. Among the Dhakaan, goblinoids work together. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers. Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the *khesh'dar* ("silent folk"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh'dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin.

As an adventurer from a Dhakaani clan, consider why are you working with the other player characters? Are you a scout gathering information? Are you searching for allies to defeat a rival clan, or to support your own unlikely bid for the Imperial throne? Are you an exile? If so, do you hope to regain your position, or have you abandoned your ties to the Dhakaani?

### Goblinoid Names
Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.

**Male Names**: Aruget, Chetiin, Daavn, Dabrak, Dagii, Drevduul, Duulan, Fenic, Gudruun, Haluun, Haruuc, Jhazaal, Kallaad, Krakuul, Krootad, Mazaan, Munta, Nasaar, Rakari, Reksiit, Tariic, Taruuzh, Thuun, Vanii, Vanon, Wuudaraj

**Female Names**: Aaspar, Aguus, Belaluur, Denaal, Draraar, Duusha, Ekhaas, Eluun, Graal, Gaduul, Hashak, Jheluum, Kelaal, Mulaan, Nasree, Raleen, Razu, Rekseen, Senen, Shedroor, Tajiin, Tuneer, Valii, Wuun

### Racial Traits
If you're playing a goblinoid, your racial traits are determined by whether you're a bugbear, goblin, or hobgoblin.

- Bugbear
- Goblin
- Hobgoblin

## Half-Elves
*I'm not half anything. You humans come from Sarlona. Elves are from Aerenal. Me? I'm a true child of Khorvaire.*— Nandon Tam, Khoravar activistFrom the Towering Woods of the Eldeen Reaches to the slums of Sharn, half-elves are found across Khorvaire. New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent's culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term "half-elf," instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning "children of Khorvaire."

The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don't consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don't experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human.

In making a half-elf character, consider whether you were born in a Khoravar community, or if your parents were members of different races. Is your half-elf identity a source of pride, a simple fact of life, or something that has been difficult for you?

### Khoravar
The culture that has developed among Khorvaire's native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don't expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers' sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.

Many Khoravar espouse the idea of "the bridge between," the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.

Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.

As you create a Khoravar character, you have a wide range of options to describe your backstory. The Khoravar Origin table can provide inspiration for it.

##### Khoravar Origin
| d10 | Origin |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | You're the linchpin of a Khoravar community in a major city, hosting unity meals and maintaining connections with every half-elf in the city. |
| 2 | You grew up in a small town dominated by humans. You didn't know any other half-elves, and you did your best to fit in. |
| 3 | You lived in the Eldeen Reaches as part of a small Khoravar community, trying to be a bridge between the human farmers in the east and the druids and wilder folk in the west. |
| 4 | Your small Khoravar community has only survived in the slums of Sharn through the close, family-like support you show each other. |
| 5 | You're part of a community in Thrane whose devotion to the Silver Flame has led you to extend your unity meals to non-Khoravar. |
| 6 | Your Khoravar community is the crew of a Lhazaar ship. |
| 7 | You're part of a tiny Khoravar community in Karrnath that's fascinated with death and the practices of your Aereni ancestors, transforming your unity meals into grim celebrations of death. |
| 8 | You're part of a tiny community of Khoravar living in an unexpected place, such as Droaam, Darguun, or even the Demon Wastes. Your people strive to find common ground with the native population. |
| 9 | You are associated with House Lyrandar or House Medani, but you're more interested in the role the house plays in supporting Khoravar communities than in the work of its guilds. |
| 10 | You ride with the Valenar, hoping one day to prove that you are worthy of taking on a patron ancestor. |

### Half-Elves and Dragonmarks
Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the Mark of Detection is found in House Medani and the Mark of Storm in House Lyrandar. Both houses were established families among the Khoravar by the time their dragonmarks appeared, and they remain pillars of the Khoravar's diverse culture. The Khoravar ideal of building bridges supports the work of both houses.

With the Mark of Storm, House Lyrandar operates sailing ships and flying vessels, as well as bringing rain to farmlands. House Medani uses the Mark of Detection to offer services of personal protection.

## Halflings
*Zombies? Minotaurs? They don't scare me a bit. But a howling halfling warrior charging in on a clawfoot raptor? Most terrifying thing I've ever seen.*— Sir Danton ir'Lain, Brelish knightThe halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.

Lightfoot halflings are the more widespread halfling subrace, especially in the Talenta Plains, but stout halflings are found within nearly every halfling community.

### Talenta Halflings
The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire's cities and towns.

As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.

Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halflings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs of your home remains strong.

Finally, it can be helpful to decide on a couple of behavioral quirks that reflect your culture. The Halfling Quirks table can provide some inspiration.

##### Halfling Quirks
| d10 | Quirk |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | You are constantly amazed by things the people of the Five Nations take for granted. |
| 2 | You pattern your behavior on a species of dinosaur. |
| 3 | You are extremely curious, and you're always searching for new experiences. |
| 4 | You love to boast, and you're always telling exaggerated stories of your amazing adventures. |
| 5 | You wear a mask that you believe holds the spirit of your former dinosaur mount. You like to talk to it. |
| 6 | You don't understand the concept of "facts." To you, everything is a story, and truth is in how you tell it. |
| 7 | You are annoyed by buildings and tools designed without consideration for small people. |
| 8 | You seek vengeance for a wrong done to your people. |
| 9 | You never forget an insult or injury. |
| 10 | You ascribe everything to the work of spirits. |

### Halflings of the Five Nations
Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.

Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sharn, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point of contact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron, as described later in this chapter.

### Halflings and Dragonmarks
Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.

With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.

![[011-1-08.png|right|300]]

## Humans
*Dwarves are stoic. Elves are wise. Gnomes are cunning. And humans? They can't make up their mind, so they try to be all of these things at once.*— Kessler, bard of SharnThe first human settlers came to Khorvaire about 3,000 years ago, landing in the area now known as the Lhazaar Principalities. From there, they began a slow but inexorable spread across the continent, disrupting the placid elven empire of Aerenal and leaving further ruined remnants of fallen Dhakaani goblin kingdoms in their wake. During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries. Despite their relatively short lifespans—or perhaps because of them—humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing their limits and pursuing new ideas.

Humans prove extremely diverse; a barbarian from the Demon Wastes has little in common with a Brelish rogue. When creating a human character, consider where you're from and how that's reflected in your class and background. *Chapter 2* presents an overview of the nations of Khorvaire and ideas for characters tied to those lands. Aundair is a logical place of origin for a wizard character, but your wizard could be a down-and-out arcanist from the alleys of Sharn or a Lhazaar pirate with a knack for the mystic arts.

If you want to jump-start your ideas for a human character's origins, you can roll on the Human Origins table.

##### Human Origins
| d10 | Origin |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An impoverished wizard from Aundair, striving to prove you're as intelligent as any other Aundairian |
| 2 | A streetwise rogue from Breland who wants nothing more than to escape the bustle of Sharn forever |
| 3 | A displaced Cyran fighter who was engaged in war outside Cyre at the time of the Mourning and is now stranded with no home |
| 4 | A barbarian from the Demon Wastes who repented from a life of cruelty and hopes to atone for past evils |
| 5 | A kindly druid from the Eldeen Reaches who wants to learn about the flora and fauna of the rest of Khorvaire and beyond |
| 6 | A cleric from Karrnath who aspires to learn the arts of necromancy—for the noblest aims, of course |
| 7 | A piratical bard from the Lhazaar Principalities who loves sea shanties but also wants to immortalize the deeds of great heroes in song |
| 8 | A ranger trained to hunt the jungles of Q'barra who harbors a grudge against dragons |
| 9 | A warlock from the Shadow Marches, teetering on the edge of sanity while contemplating the daelkyr |
| 10 | A Thrane paladin of the Silver Flame who's looking for something to prove the truth underpinning belief |

### Humans and Dragonmarks
Five different dragonmarks appear among humans, reflecting their dominant status among the races of Khorvaire:

- The Mark of Making is found in House Cannith, which has used it to become one of the most powerful houses, creating an abundance of both magical and technological wonders.
- The Mark of Passage aids the humans of House Orien in operating the lightning rail and trade caravans running across the continent.
- The Mark of Sentinel makes the bodyguards, mercenaries, and Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith widely respected across Khorvaire.
- The Mark of Handling appears in House Vadalis, which uses it to breed fine mounts and other creatures.
- Humans also number among House Tharashk and manifest the Mark of Finding with their half-orc kin.

## Kalashtar
See the Kalashtar entry.

## Orcs and Half-Orcs
*We are hunters in a world of sheep.*— Kalaash'arna, Tharashk inquisitiveThousands of years before humans came to Khorvaire, the land was dominated by wild orcs and goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire. The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.

Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:

- The Ghaash'kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the "binding flame"), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call of Kalok Shash and join the Ghaash'kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.
- The Jhorash'tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.
- The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.

### Orcs of the Shadow Marches
The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr's corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. Orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.

Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.

When playing an orc or half-orc character from the Shadow Marches, consider what circumstances brought you into the wider world. The Leaving the Shadow Marches table offers some inspiration.

##### Leaving the Shadow Marches
| d8 | Reason for Leaving |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | You're associated with the Gatekeepers, and you're on a quest to combat a daelkyr-related threat beyond the bounds of the Shadow Marches. |
| 2 | House Tharashk recruited you from the Marches to serve as a mercenary in the Last War. |
| 3 | You're a simple hunter, but you've decided to seek your fortune or a real challenge in the world beyond the Marches. |
| 4 | Your village was destroyed by monsters from Droaam, so you're looking for a new place in the world. |

### Half-Orcs of Khorvaire
With the rise of the dragonmarked House Tharashk, orcs and half-orcs have spread through the Five Nations and beyond. In general, the people of the Five Nations know little about half-orcs. When people imagine a half-orc, they usually think of a Tharashk bounty hunter or dogged inquisitive, but a few ignorant sorts might still hold the stereotype of a "simpleton from the swamps."

### Half-Orcs and Dragonmarks
The Mark of Finding appears among half-orcs and humans of House Tharashk. Strangely, orcs associated with the house cannot develop this mark. Dragonmarked half-orcs work extensively with humans, orcs, and unmarked half-orcs in pursuit of the house's mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting. Across Khorvaire, anyone who wants to find something or someone turns to House Tharashk.

## Tieflings
*"The Chieftain Who Leads them," Thuel asked, "what do we know of him?"*

*"His name is Kathrik Mel. He inspires tremendous loyalty in the barbarians, an almost religious fervor."*

*"He's a demon?"*

*"I don't think so. The Ghaash'kala call him a sak'vanarrak—it translates as something like 'fiend-touched.' A Karrn scholar coined the word tiefling. I think he's some mixture of fiend and mortal, more like a savior than a god."*

*Thuel frowned. "Their savior, our damnation."*— James Wyatt, *Dragon Forge*Tieflings rarely appear in the cities and towns of Khorvaire, with most dwelling at the fringes of civilization.

Many tieflings are born to the Carrion Tribes, the barbarians who live in the Demon Wastes. Such tieflings are touched by the fiendish forces bound beneath the Wastes, and the tribes consider them to be blessed. If you're playing such a tiefling, why have you left the Wastes? It could be that you were destined for some evil purpose—perhaps even serving as an avatar for an imprisoned Overlord—and you are fleeing that destiny.

Other tieflings are shaped not by fiendish powers, but by the influence of the fiend-tainted planes. Such tieflings might be born in manifest zones, where a plane exerts influence over a region. Planar tieflings are oddities, often seen as strange but not necessarily evil.

Finally, the Venomous Demesne—a city-state hidden on the far side of Droaam—is populated by tieflings. These tieflings descend from Sarlonan mages who bargained with dark powers, with the Demesne's lords being powerful warlocks and wizards. The Venomous Demesne has had no significant contact with the Five Nations and few know it exists. Your character could be an envoy or exile from it, or simply an adventurer driven by a desire to see what lies beyond your homeland.

# Chapter 1: Character Creation - Dragonmarks

## Dragonmarks
A halfling healer touches a dying man; the mark on her forehead blazes with blue fire as his wounds close and vanish. A half-orc bounty hunter reaches out with the power of his mark to find his prey. A human artificer touches a creation forge, and the symbol on her hand flares as the eldritch machine rumbles to life. Each of these people possesses a dragonmark, a symbol etched on the skin in colors more vivid than any tattoo, magical power made flesh.

A dragonmark enhances the user's ability to perform certain tasks. For example, the Mark of Making guides the hands of the smith, while the Mark of Shadows helps its bearer avoid enemies. The power of a dragonmark can also manifest in more dramatic ways. The Mark of Storms can scatter enemies with a blast of wind, while the Mark of Shadows can weave illusions.

You can't buy or choose to develop a dragonmark; each mark is tied to bloodlines within specific species, as summarized in the Dragonmarks and Their Houses table. A dragonmark appears on a person around adolescence, though not every heir manifests the mark.

Long ago, the families that carry the marks joined together to form the dragonmarked houses. Over the course of centuries, these houses have used their gifts to establish powerful monopolies. For example, only House Lyrandar heirs with the Mark of Storms can pilot airships. This control over vital services gives the houses tremendous power.

In the past, the dragonmarked houses were held in check by the united kingdom of Galifar. But in the wake of the Last War, people wonder if any nation has the power to enforce its wishes on the houses.

### All about the Houses
Every dragonmarked house has traditions and secrets. Here's a few facts that apply to most of the houses:

**Enclaves**. Most dragonmarked houses maintain enclaves in major cities. These serve as strongholds and hubs for house businesses. A city may also have any number of businesses tied to the house, but these are simply providing services and don't have any direct connection to house leadership.

**Names and Ranks**. Any heir of the house who develops a dragonmark is allowed to add the d' prefix to the house name: for example, Merrix d'Cannith. Despite the Korth Edicts' proscription against house members holding noble titles, regional leaders within the houses are called barons. Most houses are led by a matriarch or patriarch, though some are led by a council.

**Emblems**. Each dragonmarked house has an emblem, a distinctive symbol that features on their heraldry, official seals, crafted goods, and anything else that warrants the house's stamp of authenticity. Each house's emblem appears along with the related dragonmark on the following pages.

**The Twelve**. The Twelve is an organization that facilitates cooperation among the dragonmarked houses.

**Excoriates**. Excoriates are dragonmarked heirs who have been cut off from their houses.

**Foundlings**. Foundlings are people who have a dragonmark yet have no tie to a dragonmarked house.

**Test of Siberys**. Dragonmarks manifest around adolescence. Each house puts its heirs through a trial called the Test of Siberys. The specific trials vary by house, but they place the heir in circumstances where they are likely to manifest the mark, if they have it. About half of the members of a bloodline manifest the mark.

**Korth Edicts**. The Korth Edicts prevent the houses from owning land, holding noble titles, or maintaining military forces (with an exception for Deneith). The edicts were established when the Five Nations were united. Today, many in the houses feel the edicts have become obsolete in the wake of the Last War.

### Creating a Dragonmarked Character
Dragonmarks manifest on certain members of a few species, represented in the rules by variant race options:

- For **humans** and **half-orcs**, a dragonmark is a variant race that replaces traits associated with those races.
- For **half-elves**, a dragonmark is a variant race that lets you keep some half-elf traits and replace others with the traits associated with your mark.
- For **dwarves**, **elves**, **gnomes**, and **halflings**, the dragonmark replaces your subrace.

So, if you're making an elf character, you can choose to take the Mark of Shadow instead of being a wood elf or a high elf.

There is another option related to dragonmarks if your group uses feats: the Aberrant Dragonmark feat (see *below*) grants potentially dangerous magical abilities. Aberrant dragonmarks aren't tied to the dragonmark houses and can be taken by a character of any race.

##### Dragonmarks and Their Houses
| Dragonmark | House | Race | Guild Specialties |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detection | Medani | Half-elf | Bodyguards, investigation, risk management |
| Finding | Tharashk | Human, half-orc | Bounty hunting, investigation, prospecting |
| Handling | Vadalis | Human | Animal training and breeding |
| Healing | Jorasco | Halfling | Healing |
| Hospitality | Ghallanda | Halfling | Food, lodging, urban information |
| Making | Cannith | Human | Manufacturing |
| Passage | Orien | Human | Land transportation |
| Scribing | Sivis | Gnome | Communication, translation, verification |
| Sentinel | Deneith | Human | Bodyguards, mercenaries |
| Shadow | Phiarlan | Elf | Entertainment, espionage |
|  | Thuranni | Elf | Entertainment, assassination |
| Storm | Lyrandar | Half-elf | Air and sea transportation |
| Warding | Kundarak | Dwarf | Banking, storage, prisons |

### Dragonmarks and Backgrounds
Dragonmarks are bound to certain bloodlines, and by choosing a mark, you are establishing your character's blood connection to one of the families in the dragonmarked houses. It's up to you to define your relationship to the house. Were you brought up in the house? Or are you independent from it? This is best represented by your background. Consider the following options:

**Agent**. You have a close, ongoing relationship with your house. The house agent background is a good choice if you are actively working for the house. Alternately, you could take the noble background to reflect a blood tie to the leaders of the house.

**Independent Scion**. You were raised or trained by the house, but you've kept your independence. This means you don't have many special privileges, but you also don't have responsibilities. Guild artisan is a good choice to reflect basic house training, but you could choose entertainer for the Mark of Shadow, sailor for the Mark of Storms, soldier for the Mark of Sentinel, sage for the Mark of Scribing, and so on.

**Excoriate**. When a dragonmarked heir defies their house, they might be cut off from their family. In the past, your mark would be flayed from your body. Although this mutilation is no longer practiced, such exiles are still called excoriates. If you're an excoriate, consider what you did to deserve this punishment. Were you a criminal? A charlatan? Or perhaps a sage who engaged in forbidden research?

**Foundling**. Your ancestors left the house long ago. You have no ties to the house and may not have known you were connected by blood before you manifested your dragonmark. As an outlander or an urchin, you might know nothing about the houses. As an acolyte or a hermit, you could have put your faith ahead of worldly things, choosing not to pursue a connection with the houses. Whatever you decide, this is an opportunity to talk with your DM about the role you'd like the house to play in a campaign. Do you want them to be your enemy? Would you prefer to avoid them completely? Or do you want to work your way into a position of power in the house, despite being an outsider?

### The Powers of the Mark
Each dragonmark grants a set of abilities that reflect the inherent powers of the mark. Your dragonmarked race gives you a set of traits derived from the magic of your mark. If you are a spellcaster, your dragonmark also fuels or channels some of your spells. Each dragonmark's description includes a list of dragonmark spells that flow from the magic of the mark. If you play a character with the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, your dragonmark spells are added to the spell list for each of your spellcasting classes, thereby expanding the spell options available to you.

You might also consider your dragonmark the source of any or all of your spells or class features. As a cleric with the Mark of Healing, for example, you could say your mark is the sole source of the healing and supportive spells you cast, or your magic might come from a combination of your mark's power and your faith in the gods. As a warlock, your aberrant dragonmark might actually be your fiendish patron, the source of all your magic. These descriptions add flavor to your character but don't change your character's abilities, beyond the dragonmark spells added to your spell list.

Over the centuries, the houses have developed tools that enhance and channel the powers of a mark, and these items (some appear in *chapter 5*) give the houses much of their economic power.

### Dragonmark Appearance
A dragonmark appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the Mark of Detection across an eye, while another has it in the palm of the hand. Dragonmarks appear with vivid shades of blue and purple and shimmer or even move slightly. When used, they grow warm to the touch and sometimes glow (though this doesn't produce useful illumination). A dragonmark can't be removed—even if a limb bearing a dragonmark is cut away, the mark eventually manifests on another part of the bearer's body. All dragonmarks share a similar initial appearance, but a dragonmark can grow in size and complexity as a character gains levels and uses it to cast more powerful magic.

While dragonmarks share the same general appearance, your dragonmark could have a unique quality. Roll on the Dragonmark Quirks table for inspiration.

##### Dragonmark Quirks
| d8 | Quirk |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Your dragonmark is unusually small or faint. |
| 2 | Your dragonmark is exceptionally large. |
| 3 | Your dragonmark appears somewhere else on your body whenever you finish a long rest. |
| 4 | Your dragonmark emits dim light in a 5-foot radius for 10 minutes whenever you use it. |
| 5 | Your dragonmark tingles and changes color for a moment when you're within 10 feet of someone with the same mark. |
| 6 | When you use your dragonmark, it animates and adopts the appearance of your dragonmarked house's emblem for 1 minute. |
| 7 | Your dragonmark is an unusual color. |
| 8 | Your dragonmark changes size whenever you use it. |

![[027-1-13-warding.png|right|300]](Mark of Warding)
## The Mark of Detection
![[028-1-14.png|right|300]]

*If you want a wall of muscle to get between you and a blade, go to House Deneith. If you want someone to anticipate the threat and make sure you aren't even in the room with whoever's holding that blade, that's what we do.*— Baron Trelib d'MedaniThe Mark of Detection is an inquisitive's dream. It sharpens powers of observation and intuition, allowing the bearer to draw connections and interpret clues others might miss. By actively drawing on its powers, the bearer can detect poisons and study the energies of magic.

### House Medani
![[029-1-15.png|right|300]]

**Leader**: Baron Trelib d'Medani

**Headquarters**: Tower of Inquisition (Wroat, Breland)

Represented by the basilisk's eye, the Warning Guild of House Medani brokers the services of bodyguards and inquisitives. Medani advisors specialize in risk assessment and management, protecting clients from both physical and social threats. While Medani overlaps with the inquisitives of House Tharashk and the bodyguards of House Deneith, the Warning Guild specializes in subtle threats and complex mysteries. Baron Trelib manages the guild's affairs from the Tower of Inquisition in Wroat, where the house also interrogates prisoners for King Boranel of Breland.

The members of House Medani are half-elves with deep roots in Breland. Medani has little interest in the power struggles that sometimes break out between the other dragonmarked houses. Many Medani heirs are more interested in helping their communities than in raw profit, and Medani heirs often work with local law enforcement or help those who can't afford their services.

### Variant Half-Elf: Mark of Detection
See the Half-Elf (Variant; Mark of Detection) entry.

## The Mark of Finding
![[030-1-16.png|right|300]]

*My ancestors used their gift to track beasts in the swamps. I use mine to find fugitives in the slums of Sharn. I'm still a hunter. I always find my mark.*— Hondar'Aashta, Tharashk bounty hunterThe Mark of Finding sharpens the senses, guiding the hunter to prey. Alone among the dragonmarks, the Mark of Finding is carried by two races: humans and half-orcs. It first appeared in the Shadow Marches, where clan hunters used it to find their prey.

### House Tharashk
**Leader**: The Triumvirate (Maagrim Torrn, Khandar'aashta, and Daric Velderan)

**Headquarters**: Zarash'ak, Shadow Marches

House Tharashk traditionally licenses inquisitives and bounty hunters. Recently the house's Finder's Guild has expanded into dragonshard prospecting. As dragonshards are the lifeblood of the magical economy, the house's talent has given them new wealth and influence.

Tharashk is the youngest of the dragonmarked houses and hasn't embraced all the customs of the others. The distinct clans that united to form the house remain important, and heirs of the family usually retain their family names rather than adopting "d'Tharashk" as tradition dictates. Each of the three major clans—the Aashta, the Torrn, and the Velderan—has a representative on the Triumvirate that governs the house, and the city of Zarash'ak in the Shadow Marches. Together, they stand as one under the emblem of the dragonne (a lion-dragon hybrid).

### Variant Half-Orc or Human: Mark of Finding
![[031-1-17.png|right|300]]

See the Half-Orc (Mark of Finding) and Human (Mark of Finding) entries.

## The Mark of Handling
![[032-1-18.png|right|300]]

*Don't get sentimental. A beast is a tool. Our role is to find the right tool for the task and to make sure they're of the finest quality. Nature is our kingdom; never forget that we were born to rule it.*— Dalin d'VadalisThe Mark of Handling gives its bearer a primal connection to beasts and the natural world, granting the power to calm and coax. This extends beyond purely natural animals; the mark allows its bearer to guide a hippogriff as easily as a horse.

### House Vadalis
![[033-1-19.png|right|300]]

**Leader**: Dalin d'Vadalis

**Headquarters**: Foalswood (near Varna, Eldeen Reaches)

Represented by the hippogriff, House Vadalis plays an important role in daily life, offering meat, mounts, and more. Vadalis isn't one of the most powerful houses, but its barons are generally content; they're more interested in discovering new monstrosities than engaging in politics. The current head of the house, Dalin d'Vadalis, disdains the use of a title and has no aspirations to nobility or greatness for himself or his house.

House Vadalis breeds and trains beasts for a wide range of purposes. While the house maintains vast cattle ranches and trains horses and hounds, the Mark of Handling allows Vadalis to work with more exotic creatures as well. Griffons, hippogriffs, and even bulettes can be bred and trained. Even with the Mark of Handling, this is dangerous work; there's a lot of turnover at the bulette ranch. But these exotic creatures aren't enough to satisfy the most innovative members of the house, leading to the practice of magebreeding. Using dragonshard focus items, Vadalis has found ways to create magical creatures. Typically, this results in a superior version of a creature—an animal that is stronger, faster, and smarter. But rumors claim that Vadalis has crafted monsters of its own. Some rumors even insist that Vadalis is trying to magebreed better humans.

### Variant Human: Mark of Handling
See the Human (Mark of Handling) entry.

## The Mark of Healing
![[034-1-20.png|right|300]]

*What's the price of a life? Well, I've got a rate sheet right over here. I'd be happy to discuss it.*— Bessi d'Jorasco, Fairhaven healerA halfling with the Mark of Healing can save a life with a touch, restoring vitality and the will to live. When dealing with mundane medicine, the mark helps its bearer sense the nature of maladies, aiding them in finding a cure. When equipped with dragonshard focus items, the mark can even draw the dead back from the depths of Dolurrh.

### House Jorasco
![[035-1-21.png|right|300]]

**Leader**: Ulara d'Jorasco

**Headquarters**: Vedkyar Enclave (Vedykar, Karrnath)

The Healer's Guild provides a vital service to Khorvaire, and the Last War ensured there was great need for healers. The leader of the guild, Baron Ulara d'Jorasco, is much beloved in northwestern Khorvaire for her instrumental role in combating an epidemic in that region a decade ago, and Jorasco medics served in every nation's army during the war.

The guild runs schools that teach medicine, as well as houses of healing that provide both mundane and magical services. If it could save a life, it's probably marked by the House Jorasco griffon emblem, and it will come with a cost. If you have the gold, Jorasco healers can remove a disease instantly with *lesser restoration*. If you can't afford such a service, they will treat you with mundane techniques. House Jorasco is also the source of *potions of healing*. While many criticize Jorasco's demands for payment, the house maintains that it's not about greed; it's about ensuring the prosperity of the house, so they can continue to help future generations.

While the public face of Jorasco is that of the healer, there are rumors that the house engaged in disturbing experiments during the Last War, working with House Vadalis to develop biological weapons and new creatures. A Jorasco heir has to decide if they want to investigate these rumors.

### Halfling Subrace: Mark of Healing
See the Halfling (Mark of Healing) entry.

## The Mark of Hospitality
![[036-1-22.png|right|300]]

*Welcome, welcome! So good to see you again. Let me get your drink—blackroot tal with honey, yes? And then you have to listen to this story I've heard about the strange things going on in the Cogs.*— Alara d'Ghallanda, halfling bartenderThey may not always have gold, but a halfling with the Mark of Hospitality is sure to be rich in friends. The magic of the mark allows the bearer to keep a place clean, and to heat, chill, and season food. But it also helps the bearer connect with others.

### House Ghallanda
![[037-1-23.png|right|300]]

**Leader**: Yoren d'Ghallanda

**Headquarters**: Gatherhold (Talenta Plains)

The majority of inns, taverns, and restaurants in the Five Nations are either directly owned by House Ghallanda or licensed by its Hosteler's Guild. Most people give little thought to House Ghallanda; when compared to the soldiers of House Deneith and the factories of House Cannith, an alliance of innkeepers seems harmless and inconsequential. But Ghallanda's strength lies in charm and connections. A Ghallanda innkeeper hears many things—if you want to know what's really going on in a community, talk to the halfling bartender. The leaders of House Ghallanda don't sell information; they prefer to build friendship and deal in favors. But should a Ghallanda baron ever truly need something, they likely have a favor they can call in.

Ghallanda has a number of "bound businesses"—franchises run directly by the house. The Gold Dragon Inn is such a business, with Gold Dragon Inns being found in every major city, each serving a familiar menu and providing similar services. But many Ghallanda heirs take pride in creating their own unique businesses. There are also many independent restaurants, inns, and taverns licensed by House Ghallanda. The blink dog emblem is an assurance that a locale meets Ghallanda standards of health and quality—but not every inn is run by a halfling.

House Ghallanda's mandate extends beyond providing creature comforts to travelers. Every one of the house's enclaves—which are more numerous than those of any other dragonmarked house—is a sanctuary beyond the legal reach of any government or dragonmarked house. Baron Yoren and his daughter Chervina have greatly expanded the house's presence even in remote areas such as the edge of the Demon Wastes, guided by their study of the Draconic Prophecy.

### Halfling Subrace: Mark of Hospitality
See the Halfling (Mark of Hospitality) entry.

## The Mark of Making
![[038-1-24.png|right|300]]

*My house built the modern world. Orien may drive the lightning rail, but it's Cannith who builds the cars and lays the stones it travels on. Cannith makes the everbright lanterns hold the night at bay. Smith, carpenter, alchemist—the best all carry my seal.*— Baron Merrix d'CannithThe Mark of Making guides its bearer through any act of creation. The bearer of the mark can mend broken things with a touch, and always has a minor magic item they've been working on. An artificer or a wizard will get the most out of the mark, but anyone can find a use for an enchanted blade.

### House Cannith
![[039-1-25.png|right|300]]

**Leaders**: Cannith East, Zorlan d'Cannith; Cannith West, Jorlanna d'Cannith; Cannith South, Merrix d'Cannith

**Headquarters**: Cannith East, Korth Enclave (Karrnath); Cannith West, Aundair Enclave (near Fairhaven, Aundair); Cannith South, Cannith Tower (Sharn, Breland)

House Cannith dominates all forms of manufacturing, both mystical and mundane. Gorgon-marked Cannith forgeholds use streamlined forms of production to quickly produce common goods. Even independent artisans often learn their trade at Cannith academies and adhere to Cannith standards. The House of Making builds the tools the other houses rely upon, and it has always been the unspoken leader of the Twelve.

The Last War was a time of great opportunity for Cannith. Every nation wanted weapons and warforged, along with mundane arms and armor. The war raised the house up, and then tore it down. House Cannith was based in Cyre, and the Mourning destroyed the house leadership and key facilities. Now three barons jockey to fill the leadership vacuum: the alchemist Jorlanna of Fairhaven, weaponsmith Zorlan of Korth, and Merrix of Sharn, innovator of warforged. It remains to be seen whether one of these leaders will unite the house, or if it will shatter under the strain. If you're an heir of House Cannith, you should decide which of these barons you serve or if you have other ideas about the house's future.

### Variant Human: Mark of Making
See the Human (Mark of Making) entry.

## The Mark of Passage
![[040-1-26.png|right|300]]

*We get things where they need to go. It doesn't matter if it's a letter, a person, or a hundred tons of steel. Whether we have to cross mountains, rivers, or the Mournland itself, Orien finds a way.*— Bali d'Orien, veteran courierThe Mark of Passage governs motion, allowing its bearer to move with uncanny speed. The bearer of the mark can even slip through space in the blink of an eye.

### House Orien
![[041-1-27.png|right|300]]

**Leader**: Kwanti d'Orien

**Headquarters**: Journey's Home (Passage, Aundair)

The House of Passage manages land transportation. The lightning rail is the house's most dramatic tool, but Orien also runs caravans and coaches across the length of Khorvaire. Dragonshard focus items ensure that the fastest vehicles are those driven by heirs with the Mark of Passage, but the house also licenses unmarked teamsters. The Courier's Guild of House Orien delivers mail and packages and has a branch that handles more covert and dangerous deliveries.

Orien has dominated transportation for centuries, but now the house is facing challenges. The Mournland is a dramatic obstacle for ground transportation, and Baron Kwanti d'Orien has had tremendous difficulty securing funds to rebuild the lightning rail line across the blasted landscape. Indeed, he spends most of his time away from his headquarters in Aundair, trying to raise funds for the project while keeping an eye on house operations. He travels across western Khorvaire in his personal lightning rail coach, the *Silver Unicorn*—a reference to the house's unicorn emblem.

House Orien's problems don't end with the Mournland, though. The expanding role of Lyrandar airships threatens the house's business. Baron Kwanti would like to be able to offer more instantaneous transportation, but long-distance teleportation is a service only the strongest Orien dragonmarks can provide. So the house is working with House Cannith in an effort to unlock and enhance this gift of the Mark of Passage. Orien heirs might be caught up in these experiments or in the rivalry with House Lyrandar.

### Variant Human: Mark of Passage
See the Human (Mark of Passage) entry.

## The Mark of Scribing
![[042-1-28.png|right|300]]

*Communication is the foundation of civilization.*— Baron Lysse Lyrriman d'SivisThe Mark of Scribing deals with communication—both the written and spoken word. A gnome who bears the mark can *feel* words as though they are living creatures, struggling to make their meaning known. The mark provides a range of gifts. It translates languages, but it also allows its bearer to communicate with others at a distance.

### House Sivis
![[043-1-29.png|right|300]]

**Leader**: Lysse Lyrriman d'Sivis

**Headquarters**: The Labyrinth (Korranberg, Zilargo)

Bearing the emblem of the cockatrice, the gnomes of House Sivis facilitate communication. This is seen most literally in *speaking stones*, magic items allowing a Sivis heir to send a short message to another speaking stone. House Sivis's message stations employs these items as the backbone of their long-distance communication network. The house also trains and licenses scribes, notaries, interpreters, cartographers, barristers, heralds, bookbinders, and others who work with words. House Sivis has an especially close relationship with House Kundarak, as Kundarak letters of credit must be notarized with a Sivis arcane mark.

House Sivis takes great pains to maintain the trust of its clients and holds a position of absolute neutrality in all disputes, whether between houses or nations. Sivis gnomes are typically friendly, curious, and engaging, but that kindly exterior might conceal a scheming mind. Gnomes have a natural love of intrigue, and the different families within the house often engage in subtle schemes and feuds. Doyenne Lyssa Larriman, the leader of the house, takes pains to ensure that these intrigues never threaten the house or its reputation.

### Gnome Subrace: Mark of Scribing
See the Gnome (Mark of Scribing) entry.

## The Mark of Sentinel
![[044-1-30.png|right|300]]

*Protection is my purpose. I defend the innocent from those who would do them harm. For my siblings, this is a job; for me, it's a calling.*— Harric d'Deneith, Sentinel MarshalThe Mark of Sentinel warns and protects. It heightens senses and reflexes, allowing an heir to respond to threats with uncanny speed. It can shield its bearer from harm. Whether on the battlefield or the ballroom, someone who carries the Mark of Sentinel is prepared for danger.

### House Deneith
![[045-1-31.png|right|300]]

**Leader**: Breven d'Deneith

**Headquarters**: Sentinel Tower (Karrlakton, Karrnath)

House Deneith was born in Karrnath, and war flows in its veins. For centuries, the Blademarks Guild of House Deneith has governed the mercenary trade. While warriors with the Mark of Sentinel are among its most elite forces, House Deneith brokers the services of a wide range of soldiers, including Valenar war bands and the goblins of Droaam. Beyond the battlefield, the Defender's Guild provides exceptional bodyguards for those who can afford their services. House Deneith is also renowned for its Sentinel Marshals, agents who hold the authority to pursue criminals and enforce the law across the length of Khorvaire. The Sentinel Marshals hold the honor of the house in their hands. Being a Marshal is a privilege, and it comes with high expectations.

Despite its might and the desire of some house members to flex their military muscles, House Deneith has always maintained absolute neutrality, selling its services to all sides of a conflict. Baron Breven d'Deneith shows no inclination of using the massive, chimera-marked military forces of his house for his own ends, but he's surrounded by aggressive advisors who would like to see a Deneith ruling all Khorvaire. House Deneith is also caught in an escalating rivalry with House Tharashk, as it edges into the mercenary trade.

### Variant Human: Mark of Sentinel

## The Mark of Shadow
![[046-1-32.png|right|300]]

*The illusions that I weave dazzle and deceive. Sometimes that deception eases your burdens, letting you forget your troubles for a moment. But I can also ease your burdens by ending your life.*— Lady Elara d'Thuranni, shadow dancerThe Mark of Shadow lets an elf weave illusions, crafting magic to distract or delight. It also allows its bearer to sculpt shadows, making it easy to avoid detection.

### The Houses of Shadow
![[047-1-33.png|right|300]]

**Leader**: House Phiarlan, Elvinor Elorrenthi d'Phiarlan; House Thuranni, Elar d'Thuranni

**Headquarters**: House Phiarlan, the Demesnes (various); House Thuranni, Regalport (Lhazaar Principalities)

Elves have carried the Mark of Shadow for thousands of years. The mark's bearers left Aerenal after the conflict that wiped out the Mark of Death and established House Phiarlan in Khorvaire. These elves are expert entertainers, giving them access to all manner of places and secrets. Known to few, there has always been an elite force of spies and assassins within House Phiarlan. Only special clients—nobles, merchant lords, and the like—have access to these spies.

Toward the end of the Last War, a bitter feud broke out between the major families of the house. Known as the Shadow Schism, it resulted in a split withinin Phiarlan—and the foundation of House Thuranni. House Phiarlan continues to offer entertainment and espionage in the lands west of the Mournland, while Thuranni operates in the eastern lands. As a rule, Phiarlan elves are the better spies and Thuranni agents are superior assassins. Thuranni and Phiarlan maintain a peaceful relationship, but rivalries run deep.

Baron Elar d'Thuranni is said to be responsible for the Shadow Schism. Ruling the house from an enclave in Regalport, he is always accompanied by a shadowy pair, rumored to be embodiments of shadow itself. The displacer beast serves as the young house's emblem.

The lands of House Phiarlan, known as the Demesnes, are the foremost centers of the arts in the Five Nations, each focusing on a specific artistic tradition: the written word, movement arts, music, material arts, and the arts of illusion, puppetry, oratory, and acting. Baron Elvinor Elorrenthi leads the house from the last of those, the Demesne of Shadow, which is located in Sharn. The hydra serves as House Phiarlan's emblem.

## The Mark of Storm
![[048-1-34.png|right|300]]

*Sovereigns and Firstborn, grant me the four blessings promised to our people: dominion over the air, dominion over the water, fortune for my family, and fortune for my future.*— From the Oath of LyrandarWind and water welcome the half-elves who carry the Mark of Storm, and some learn to call on the power of the storm itself.

### House Lyrandar
![[049-1-35.png|right|300]]

**Leader**: Esravash d'Lyrandar

**Headquarters**: Stormhome (Aundair)

House Lyrandar has long ruled the seas. Their kraken-marked galleons harness air and water elementals and are faster than any mundane vessel. Control of sea and river trade gave Lyrandar considerable power. Now they reach out to the skies. Merely a decade old, Lyrandar airships have undermined the lightning rail's domination of overland travel.

House Lyrandar also controls the air in a literal way. The Raincallers' Guild can use the Mark of Storms to control the weather for its clients.

For many of the house's members, the house is more than a family or business—its private island enclave, Stormhome, is the closest thing they have to a homeland. Baron Esravash is ambitious and often steers the house to act in what she sees as the interests of all half-elves. Lyrandar heirs help the Valenar elves run their young kingdom, and some believe that Valenar could become a true homeland for the Khoravar.

### Variant Half-Elf: Mark of Storm

## The Mark of Warding
![[050-1-36.png|right|300]]

*My family has the finest vaults you can imagine. They forge the locks that secure royal jewels. And I learned to pick those locks when I was barely out of the crib.*— Cutter, burglar and Kundarak excoriateThe Mark of Warding helps its bearers protect things of value. Using the mark, a dwarf can weave wards with mystic force. It also provides its bearer with an intuitive understanding of locks used to protect and seal.

### House Kundarak
![[051-1-37.png|right|300]](Kundarak Vault)

**Leader**: Morrikan d'Kundarak

**Headquarters**: Korunda Gate (Mror Holds)

If you want to keep something safe—jewels, secrets, prisoners—Kundarak is there to help. The Defenders Guild of House Kundarak trains locksmiths, security specialists, and more. It maintains the prison of Dreadhold, along with a number of smaller prisons. As useful as these services are, it's the Banking Guild that truly defines the house. Kundarak's lands in the Mror Holds include deep veins of precious metals, which the dwarves used to establish the banking industry of Khorvaire. Anyone who makes a living from coin—from bankers to goldsmiths—likely learned their skills at House Kundarak. The security of banks bearing the Kundarak manticore emblem is legendary. The house also provides a special service to those who can afford it: a system of extradimensional vaults, allowing a client to store their goods in one location and retrieve them at any other Kundarak enclave.

House Kundarak has a close alliance with House Sivis. Like the House of Scribing, Kundarak has worked to earn the trust of its clients and to establish a reputation for unshakable integrity. The house has no love of renegade dwarves using their marks to turn a profit, and such rogues strive to avoid the eye of Kundarak.

As the dwarves of the Mror Holds have come into increasing conflict with the daelkyr, Lord Morrikan d'Kundarak has instructed house heirs to establish connections with the Gatekeeper druids. The druids have much in common with the house, being the creators of the wards that protect Eberron from the daelkyr.

## Aberrant Dragonmarks
*Your sigil creates, child of Cannith. Mine holds the power to destroy.*— Rotting Bal, Tarkanan enforcer![[052-1-38.png|right|300]]

The twelve dragonmarks are predictable, and their powers are generally constructive. But there is another kind of dragonmark, which is dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Aberrant marks often appear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike—even if they grant the same power, they might manifest in different ways.

It usually takes time for a character to learn to control an aberrant mark, and in time, people might be hurt by it. This factor has led to the general superstition that people with aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous.

Aberrant marks are feared for another reason, too. Long ago, aberrant marks were more common and some held great powers. Aberrant leader Halas Tarkanan could devastate cities with powerful earthquakes. The Lady of the Plague wielded disease and commanded hordes of vermin. The dragonmarked houses united in an inquisition called the War of the Mark. Some say this was a persecution of innocents, but most feared the aberrants and stood by as the houses hunted them down. Following the War of the Mark, aberrant dragonmarks were few in number and relatively weak. But since the Mourning, aberrant marks have been appearing in greater numbers.

The house agent background is the perfect background option for a character tied to a dragonmarked house.

# Chapter 1: Character Creation - Group Patrons
When creating characters for an Eberron campaign, consider choosing a patron for your adventuring party. This section describes general categories of patrons and also examples of each kind of patron from across Khorvaire. Work as a team with your DM to select a group patron. As an alternative, your characters could form your own organization that might one day stand among the great powers of the world.

Mighty dragonmarked houses, small home-town newspapers, national rulers, powerful immortals, and various other organizations and individuals hold the reins of power in Khorvaire. They bind the fabric of society together, and they are responsible for much of the change that occurs in the world—often by means of agents that include parties of adventurers. An adventuring group that has a powerful backer as a patron has a clear place in the world, access to additional resources, and a reason to work together in pursuit of a common cause.

## How Patrons Work
Each type of patron in this section includes the following information:

- An example of the general type of patron, including information about its organization, headquarters, allies, and enemies
- Suggestions for various roles that characters in your party might take on, including classes, backgrounds, and skills that are useful for filling that role
- Possibilities regarding your patron's background and your characters' roles in it, including the kinds of adventures and missions you might undertake on its behalf
- Benefits your group gets from your patron, which might include compensation, equipment, privileges, and proficiencies
- A list of potential contacts who can serve as your personal connection to your patron

### Assignments
Patrons are more than a resource for your group to draw on, they are also a responsibility. Some patrons might be eager to support your group, while others might prove more demanding.

Your group's patron might occasionally come to you and give you an assignment. This can be an easy way to get into an adventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respond to your patron's demands, and interesting stories can emerge if you decide to refuse an assignment.

Even a patron that isn't heavy-handed can significantly motivate your group. Maybe you'll seek adventures based on what pleases your patron and so earn a reward. A university, for example, might not send you on a particular mission, but you might decide to follow leads to an ancient artifact hoping the university might reward you for bringing it back. You have the freedom to chart your own destiny, while still letting the patron shape the nature of your group and the adventures you undertake.

It might help to think of the patrons in this section in terms of three broad categories of autonomy:

With a **highly directive** patron, you are an employee of an organization, and the organization often tells you what to do. Crime syndicates, dragonmarked houses, espionage agencies, military forces, and newspapers are typically highly directive.

With a **highly autonomous** patron, you are more like a freelancer. Your patron might offer you assignments or reward you for achieving certain objectives, but it doesn't dictate your activities. Adventurers' guilds, heads of state, immortal beings, inquisitive agencies, religious orders, and universities are typically highly autonomous.

In a **player-directed** organization, you don't have a patron because your adventuring party is in charge. You're the boss; you tell others what to do, and you're responsible to no one for your own activities. A criminal syndicate, inquisitive agency, military force, or newspaper can be a player-directed organization.

### Benefits and Favors
Every group patron offers your party a number of benefits for your service. These benefits range from standard business arrangements, like a salary and access to staff facilities, to more extraordinary boons, like audiences with powerful figures or exceptions from certain laws. Specific benefits are presented in more detail in the benefits section of each group patron.

Beyond the benefits described in each group patron's description, patrons can also grant additional favors. If your party is in good standing with your patron—proving yourselves reliable agents who fulfill the group's goals—your patron might grant requests for additional favors. A favor might take a variety of forms appropriate to the patron's area of influence or expertise, such as small loans, specialized equipment, or access to people and places you wouldn't otherwise have. Patrons who you regularly find yourself in conflict with aren't likely to grant you favors, unless doing so directly furthers their goals.

In any case, the DM shouldn't feel limited to providing only the benefits noted in each group patron's description. Patrons give a party access to solutions and support they wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron might use their varied resources to guide their agents or prepare them for greater adventures.

### Being Your Own Patron
For certain kinds of organizations, you can either join an existing group or found your own. For some players, the idea of running a crime syndicate, inquisitive agency, mercenary company, or newspaper is much more exciting than working for someone else. Founding your own organization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though potentially at the cost of support and reliable work.

The information in this section applies whether you join an organization or found your own. When you're the boss, some of the benefits of belonging to an organization become expenses you have to worry about; when you run your own mercenary company, for example, you need to stock your own armory rather than drawing on an existing organization's stockpile. The organization brings in income, but you'll have to spend some of it to keep the organization running.

When you run your own organization, you can use the Running a Business downtime activity (see *chapter 6* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) to reflect your organization's ongoing activities. More than one character can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling to determine the business's performance, add the total days spent by all the characters to the roll to determine the business's success (still observing the maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, multiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who took part in this downtime activity.

## Patrons in Eberron
Here are the most likely types of patrons for an adventuring group in Eberron. Presented in alphabetical order, the patrons each include an example.

##### Patrons
| Type of Patron | Example |
|---|---|
| Adventurers' Guild | Clifftop Adventurers' Guild |
| Crime Syndicate | Boromar Clan |
| Dragonmarked House | Any dragonmarked house |
| Espionage Agency | King's Dark Lanterns |
| Head of State | Prince Oargev of New Cyre |
| Immortal Being | Sora Kell |
| Inquisitive Agency | Finders Guild |
| Military Force | Redcloak Battalion |
| Newspaper | *The Korranberg Chronicle* |
| Religious Order | Templars of the Silver Flame |
| University | Morgrave University |

## Adventurers' Guild
Your group has ties to a network of professional adventurers. These experts share contacts, resources, and leads on all manner of unusual and often dangerous work. Joining such a guild makes an ideal choice if you want to keep your entanglements with a patron to a minimum, as an adventurers' guild doesn't direct your activities or reward you for completing adventures.

With a few exceptions, adventurers' guilds are local in scope, since their primary benefits center on a guildhall. They might point you to adventures halfway across the world, but the general assumption is that you'll always come home to your guildhall, sooner or later.

### Clifftop Adventurers' Guild
Sharn's Clifftop neighborhood, located in the upper part of the Dura district, has long served as a crossroads for adventurers and soldiers of fortune. A dwarf named Shekkal Korranor established the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild 150 years ago, intending it as a place where explorers and wanderers could find support and good company. Shekkal died in the Last War, but the guild remains—a social club for adventurers and a one-stop marketplace for anyone seeking capable champions.

The Clifftop guild has a reputation as a collection of helpful and good-hearted adventurers. Members who tarnish the guild's reputation can no longer take advantage of the guild's benefits.

***Guildhall.*** The Clifftop Adventurers' Guild headquarters is the physical and social center of its district, a massive stone edifice built with the riches acquired over a lifetime of adventuring. Part quiet library, part comfortable inn, part active gymnasium, and part rowdy tavern, the guildhall contains practically every facility adventurers could need to train, study, and socialize. The neighborhood around it caters to adventurers' other needs with its variety of shops and services.

***Membership.*** Most of the members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild have a modest amount of experience as successful adventurers. Nearly everyone can boast of a successful delve into the old ruins beneath Sharn or an expedition to the Talenta Plains. The guild's leader, a dwarf named Sumara "Summer" Korranor, is a descendant of its founder and a fixture around the guildhall.

***Allies.*** Relationships with most of the guild's allies are based on business and built on upstanding reputations. Ultimately, though, the guild is a loose affiliation of groups, and organizations that have a good relationship with one of those groups might not transfer their good will to another. The following groups do brisk business with members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild:

>> ##### Voice of Breland—Watch Commander or Crime Lord?
>>Watch Commander Lian Halamar, in charge of the large and prestigious Daggerwatch Garrison in Sharn's Dura quarter, has long been suspected of ties to the infamous Boromar Clan. Though these suspicions are often dismissed as simple prejudice in the assumption that any halfling in Sharn must be associated with the crime syndicate, the Voice of Breland, in cooperation with civic-minded members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guid, have uncovered stunning evidence confirming this connection. The Clifftop guild denies claims that these accusations embody the latest fracas in the long-running tensions between the Daggerwatch Garrison and the city's various groups of heroes for hire.
>>

**Affiliated guilds**. Beyond Sharn, the guild has established good relations with adventuring guilds across Khorvaire, many of which have reciprocal agreements: their members can use the Clifftop facilities when they are in Sharn, and Clifftop guild members can make use of their facilities as well. Lists of these other guilds are kept in the Sharn guildhall.

**Clifftop businesses**. The guild is a prominent feature in its neighborhood, and much of the area is dedicated to meeting guild's needs. Some businesses there offer small (5 percent) discounts to guild members, and all businesses are eager to avoid angering members of the guild lest they lose the business of other members.

**House Sivis**. A Speakers' Guild enclave in Clifftop specializes in translating texts from Xen'drik. It also provides legal services for adventurers in trouble.

**House Tharashk**. The Tharashk enclave in Clifftop provides the services of guides with extensive experience exploring Xend'rik, and it is careful to retain only guides who receive positive referrals from guild members. House Tharashk also uses the guild as a means to hire adventurers to serve as bodyguards on their own prospecting expeditions.

***Enemies.*** Individual adventuring groups readily make lasting enemies, and occasionally that animosity extends to the guild as a whole—as is the case with the following organizations:

**Deathsgate Explorers' Club**. A fierce rivalry simmers between the Clifftop guild and Sharn's other local adventurers' guild. Sometimes the rivalry can be described as almost friendly, but the Deathsgate guild occasionally escalates it with vandalism of the Clifftop guildhall or even physical (but usually nonlethal) attacks on guild members in dark alleys.

**Sharn Watch**. Clifftop is protected of the Daggerwatch Garrison and Watch Commander Lian Halamar. Halamar has no love for adventurers and is happy to catch guild members on the wrong side of the law.

### Guild Benefits
As members of an adventurers' guild, your group gains the following benefits:

**Accommodations**. Guild members can stay at the guildhall. The room is comparable to one you'd find in a comfortable inn, but at a modest price (5 sp per day).

**Dues**. These benefits require the annual contribution of 13 gp paid to the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild. These dues fund the guild's services and activities. (Other guilds typically charge dues somewhere between 10 and 15 gp per year.)

**Information**. An adventurers' guild headquarters makes a good place to learn about topics relevant to adventurers' interests. If you need to find someone who's knowledgeable about the Mournland, for example, the Clifftop guild's headquarters in Sharn is a good place to look.

**Referrals**. The guild can recommend hired services to its members, drawing on other guild members' experiences to provide honest, reliable, and skillful hirelings.

**Storage**. The guild will store items for its members. The Clifftop guild has an account with House Kundarak banks that allow its members to store valuables in secure vaults. Some guilds have access to items such as a *bag of holding* or a safe that opens into a similar extradimensional space. In the worst case, an item can be hidden in a guildhall's basement for a time.

### Build Your Group
Membership in an adventurers' guild doesn't affect the composition of your party in any way, though it may provide added reasons for why a party features a diverse array of characters with varied fields of expertise.

### Adventurers' Guild Contacts
Typically, an adventuring group has no particular contact within the larger guild. There's a local leader or bookkeeper who collects dues, but otherwise you might interact with a variety of different members of the guild in different contexts—when looking for a contract, gathering referrals, staying in the guildhall, and so on. The Guild Contact table provides inspiration for contacts you might encounter during any given encounter with your adventurer's guild.

##### Guild Contacts
| d10 | Contact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The charismatic leader of the guild, who doesn't actually do very much except inspire and encourage members |
| 2 | A retired adventurer who works hard to connect member groups with employment opportunities that match their skills |
| 3 | A petty rival who continually tries to claim jobs, bounties, and rewards before you can |
| 4 | A bitter enemy who nurtures a grudge over some past wrong (real or imagined) and does everything possible to undermine you |
| 5 | A naive adventurer who admires you and tries to emulate you in every way |
| 6 | A hardened adventurer who thinks a moral compass is akin to a pair of manacles |
| 7 | An injured retired adventurer who can't quite let go of the adventuring life and experiences it vicariously by spending time in the guildhall |
| 8 | A grouchy employee who keeps the guildhall clean and cares for its guests while quietly complaining about how adventurers should "grow up," get a "real job," and contribute to society |
| 9 | A kindly mentor who loves to tell stories of past exploits in front of the guildhall fireplace |
| 10 | A sad, older adventurer who tells cautionary tales in the vain hope that younger members avoid making the same mistakes |

![[057-1-42.png|right|300]](Headquarters of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild)

### Guild Adventures
Among its various services, the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild offers a launchpad for all manner of adventures. Potential employers bring all manner of work to the guildhall, posting messages or seeking out those with specific fields of expertise. Guild members also relate news about opportunities via word of mouth. Such jobs might resemble those assigned by any other patron. Without a patron directing your assignments, your group is free to pursue its own goals, whether you're seeking wealth, struggling against evil, pursuing a personal vendetta, or simply reacting to disastrous events around you. The Guild Adventures table refers to the descriptions of other patrons in this section; your DM can use the adventure ideas in those descriptions to flesh out job opportunities available through your guild.

##### Guild Adventures
| d10 | Adventures |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Crime**. You have to break the law to administer justice or thwart a criminal act (see "*Crime Syndicate*"). |
| 2 | **Dragonmarked Affairs**. The job involves some dragonmarked house concern (see "*Dragonmarked House*"). |
| 3 | **Espionage**. Someone requires some spying or sabotage (see "*Espionage Agency*"). |
| 4 | **Statecraft**. You're involved in national or international affairs (see "*Head of State*"). |
| 5 | **Cryptic Mystery**. The job is linked to the concerns of immortals (see "*Immortal Being*"). |
| 6 | **Investigation**. An assignment involves finding something or solving a mystery (see "*Inquisitive Agency*"). |
| 7 | **Military Action**. Your party is invited to serve as a military unit (see "*Military Force*"). |
| 8 | **Gathering News**. You're called on to act as freelance reporters (see "*Newspaper*"). |
| 9 | **Religious Work**. The job involves the work of faith (see "*Religious Order*"). |
| 10 | **Field Research**. The job involves research or relic-hunting (see "*University*"). |

In any of these cases, the potential employer might represent an established organization (a crime syndicate or university, for example) or might be independent like your party. In the latter case, there's always the possibility that you could end up competing with an organization—running up against a crime syndicate while pursuing a criminal job, perhaps, or competing with university researchers to plunder a ruin. This competition might turn into a rivalry, or it could evolve into employment, with the crime syndicate or university recognizing your talent and becoming your patron.

### Other Adventurers' Guilds
Few guilds besides the Clifftop guild are widely known, but the following organizations have carved out reputations for themselves:

**Deathsgate Explorers' Club**. Named for the lower-class district in Sharn where it maintains its guildhall, the Deathsgate Explorers' Club is a rough-and-tumble guild made up largely of Last War veterans. Deathsgaters rarely undertake adventures from altruistic motives, demanding prompt payment or other reciprocal arrangements. They have a fierce rivalry with the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild.

**Wayfinder Foundation**. Founded by a renowned hunter and explorer, Lord Boroman ir'Dayne, the Wayfinder Foundation is an exclusive adventurers' guild that welcomes only experienced and renowned members. Dayne suffers from a wasting curse that prevents him from undertaking further adventures of his own, so he has put his considerable fortune to use in sponsoring great expeditions. The Wayfinder Foundation has an unusually wide reach for an adventurers' guild, with guildhalls found across Khorvaire as well as in the city of Stormreach, in Xen'drik. Its headquarters, and the residence of its wealthy patron, is in Fairhaven.

## Crime Syndicate
Your group is a team of crooks that's part of an organized crime syndicate. You're more talented and have a wider range of skills than most thugs and burglars, so your crew might be entrusted with more important tasks than simply roughing up local merchants or breaking into empty apartments. If you're anything like a typical adventuring party, you bring a combination of powerful magic, physical might, and a broad selection of skills to your work, making you well suited to missions like grand heists, high-profile assassinations, and epic cons.

Crime syndicates thrived during the Last War. The war left many people desperate, driving them into lives of crime. The war also demanded huge numbers of able-bodied soldiers, which reduced the ranks of law enforcement across Khorvaire. As a result, most settlements have some organized criminal element, ranging from small local thieves' guilds to international organizations with dozens of interconnected branches.

### Boromar Clan
The Boromar Clan is the most powerful criminal organization in the city of Sharn. From its humble start as a gang of smugglers and thieves, the Boromars have risen to become one of the most influential forces in the city. They have a stranglehold on the smuggling trade and own the majority of the gambling halls in the city, while most of the fences and thieves in Sharn either work directly for the them or pay tribute in exchange for independence. The Boromars control a vast network of extortion, blackmail, and graft that extends throughout the city, and their influence reaches far beyond the criminal underworld. The early Boromar patriarchs invested wisely over the centuries, and today the Boromars are one of the Sixty, the elite tier of Sharn's aristocracy. The Boromar Clan owns warehouses, taverns, and inns throughout the city, and it has a considerable interest in the shipping trade. A Boromar heir sits on the city council of Sharn, and the current head of the clan is a member of the Gold Concord of the Aurum (described in *chapter 4*).

As much as some members of the Sharn Council and the Watch would like to see the Boromars disbanded, the syndicate is unlikely to collapse any time soon.

***Membership.*** The core membership of the Boromar Clan—comprising about one in six of its members—is an extended family of halflings descended from immigrants who came to Sharn from the Talenta Plains. Another third of the members are unrelated halflings, and the rest belong to other species. The syndicate employs a wide variety of bookkeepers and administrators as well as burglars, con artists, smugglers, and other criminals. When a situation calls for physical violence, the Boromars usually hire freelancers—members of the Sharn Guard or agents of House Tarkanan. The Boromar family proper has a team of personal bodyguards called the Clawfoots, who are mostly fierce halfling warriors recently relocated from the Talenta Plains. They primarily defend Boromar holdings and headquarters in the halfling district of Little Plains.

***Allies.*** The Boromar Clan has a reputation for omnipotence that makes even the forces of law and order in Sharn hesitant to cross it. It's far safer to be an ally of the syndicate, or at least to stay out of its way, than it is to be its enemy—and it's more lucrative to boot. The following groups count themselves among the Boromar Clan's closest allies:

**House Jorasco**. The head of the Boromar Clan, Saidan Boromar, is married to an unmarked heir of House Jorasco, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco. This marriage has created important ties between the Boromars and the halfling healers of Sharn. Members of the Boromar family can secure healing for free, and other members of the syndicate receive a 10 percent discount at Jorasco houses of healing.

**Sharn Council**. Of the seventeen members of Sharn's city council, four have close ties to the Boromar Clan—including one, Ilyra Boromar, who reports directly to the head of the syndicate. These four vote as a bloc to ensure that the council doesn't take direct action against the Boromars, while enough of the other council members fear the syndicate that they tend to carry the vote. A member of the Boromar Clan can call in a favor to secure an audience with one of these councilors, though such does not guarantee aid.

**Sharn Watch**. The Boromars have been bribing captains of the Sharn Watch for generations. What's more, if the Boromar Clan collapsed, the underworld would erupt in anarchy as dozens of petty crime lords fought for territory and position. As a result, a member of the Boromars can call in a favor to get minor criminal charges dismissed.

***Enemies.*** Despite the Boromar Clan's position of strength in Sharn, it has many foes, and their unrelenting assaults have put the syndicate in what might be its most precarious position ever. Currently, the following groups pose the greatest threats to Boromar interests:

**Daask**. The monstrous criminal guild called Daask, a pawn of the leaders of Droaam, has started launching violent raids against Boromar holdings over the last two years. A mobile organization using guerrilla tactics, Daask has managed to circumvent Boromar security and avoid serious reprisals for a range of violent thefts and sabotages. Agents of Daask go out of their way to harm up-and-coming Boromar agents.

**Sharn Council**. Despite four friends on the city council, the Boromar Clan has several enemies as well. At least three councilors oppose the Boromars because of genuine concern for their constituents; two more oppose the syndicate because they're part of rival organizations (the Aurum and the Tyrants). Because of their influence, the council has so far refused to devote any resources to combating the rise of Daask, hoping the monstrous guild will bring down the Boromars. Individual members of the Boromar Clan can be sure that these councilors will oppose any petition they might bring to the council.

### Patron Benefits
With a crime syndicate as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Savagery in style at Tain gala
>>The annual Tain Gala, as everyone knows, brings the wealthiest and most prominent citizens of Sharn together in a grand display of opulence and power. But last night, it also provided a shocking display of violence, as Saidan Boromar—head of the Boromar family, which is allegedly tied to all manner of criminal activities throughout the city—was confronted by a would-be assassin (whose name will not be made public until her next of kin have been identified and notified). Boromar and his wife, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco, escaped unharmed thanks to the timely intervention of their bodyguard, a recent immigrant from the Talenta Plains whose fascinating culture and fierce demeanor were both in plain view last night. A Boromar spokesperson identified the bodyguard as Halak Boromar, head of the Clawfoots—the Boromar family's personal guard, named for the dinosaurs ridden by halflings in the Talenta Plains.
>>

**Assignments**. The Boromar Clan doesn't pay you, but it might assign you to particular tasks. Sometimes these are tasks someone has hired the syndicate to perform (such as an assassination), in which case the syndicate passes 85 percent of the fee on to your group. Other times, your aim is to enrich the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), in which case you have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you steal. Other syndicates might take more or less than a 15 percent share, at the DM's discretion.

**Contraband**. You have access to your syndicate's "business" of dealing with contraband, such as poisons or narcotics. You don't receive a discount on these goods, but you can always find someplace to purchase them.

**Fences**. Members or associates of your syndicate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and you have access to this service as well. Fences are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also expensive items such as works of art and even magic items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime activity described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* and *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*) to the fence. The drawback is that you don't get to choose whether to accept the offer you might receive—the fence makes that call for you.

**Immunity**. As a member of the Boromar Clan, you are protected from other members of the clan. No one in your syndicate targets you for their own criminal operations. (Of course, the same is expected of you.) On the other hand, if you have rivals within the clan, they might find other ways to interfere with your activities.

**Syndicate-Owned Businesses**. The Boromar Clan owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for laundering money. When you buy from one of these businesses, you get a 5 percent discount. The DM decides what goods and services are available.

### Build Your Group
Naturally, a large portion of the Boromar Clan's members come from a criminal background. There's no reason characters with other backgrounds can't be part of the syndicate, though. The Boromars recruit ex-soldiers as muscle, trained sages for research, sailors to crew smuggling vessels, and charlatans and urchins for their unique talents. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:

**Bruiser**. Sometimes subtlety means breaking just one of a snitch's kneecaps. The Bruiser uses force and the threat of force to make sure that the crime syndicate gets what it wants. Strength is a natural prerequisite for the role, but Charisma can also be useful, especially when combined with proficiency in Intimidation to reinforce the danger inherent in the Bruiser's presence. Plenty of Bruisers have a criminal past, but former soldiers are often recruited into this role as well. Fighters and rogues make natural Bruisers.

**Burglar**. Agile and nimble, the Burglar relies on Dexterity and proficiency in skills such as Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth to get in to a target location, take valuables, and get out without being noticed. Some Burglars specialize in certain types of theft, such as housebreaking or picking pockets. Besides characters with the criminal background, young urchins often find a place in criminal syndicates by filling this role. Rogues are natural Burglars, but anyone else with the right combination of skills and abilities can do the job.

**Mastermind**. Somebody has to be the brains of any criminal operation—that's where the Mastermind comes in. A high Intelligence benefits this character, as does proficiency in skills such as Insight and Investigation. Masterminds often come from backgrounds such as acolyte, noble, or sage, that give them a broad range of knowledge to support their schemes. Bards, rogues, and wizards are often drawn to this role.

**Safecracker**. The "breaking" part of "breaking and entering" is the Safecracker's job. A typical Safecracker might have proficiency with thieves' tools, as well as the Dexterity required to use them expertly. Intelligence can be important for figuring out complicated locks and secret doors. Many Safecrackers also boast a high Strength for those cases where lockpicks fail. Safecrackers often come from criminal backgrounds, but characters with experience using other tools and devices, including guild artisans and even sailors, also fall naturally into this role. Artificer or rogue makes a natural class choice for the Safecracker.

**Talker**. From con artists to fences, anyone who relies on interpersonal skills and a network of contacts falls into the role of the Talker. Charisma proves useful for this role, along with proficiencies in skills such as Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion. The charlatan background is perfect for Talkers, but criminals, urchins, and others can fill the role with the right skills. Bards are a natural fit for the job as well.

### Types of Crime
Your work as syndicate members involves more than simple street swindles or pickpocketing. A team with your skills comes together for greater purposes—more dangerous risks and far more splendid rewards. As a group, consider the options on the Syndicate Crimes table and work with your DM to decide what kinds of work you do for the Boromar Clan.

##### Syndicate Crimes
| d6 | Crime |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Acquisitions and Retrieval**. Your job is to acquire assets for the syndicate. You might steal important documents or clear out a location for use as a hideout. |
| 2 | **Heists**. You plan and execute elaborate robberies that require the skills of everyone on your team. |
| 3 | **Gang Warfare**. Your primary job is to ensure that no other crime syndicate (such as Daask or House Tarkanan) gains a significant foothold in your territory. |
| 4 | **Internal Affairs**. Your task is to keep all the corrupt, headstrong, and avaricious members of your syndicate in line with the goals and rules of the group. |
| 5 | **Assassination**. Your work involves killing prominent people—the sort who have numerous bodyguards and elaborate security systems to circumvent. |
| 6 | **Topple the Powerful**. Your syndicate might be criminal and your methods illegal, but your goals are righteous. You help people who are powerless to defend themselves against exploitation by the rich and powerful. |

### Infamy
Even among the notorious Boromar Clan, your group has a distinct identity and a reputation. What's the event or unique trait that makes your crew stand out? Consult the Group Infamy table for suggestions on how your group might stand out within the larger syndicate.

##### Group Infamy
| d6 | Notorious Element |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Tattoos**. Each member of your group has a distinct tattoo that inspires fear in others. When possible, you use the symbol as a calling card to mark your work. |
| 2 | **Outfit**. Whether it is a leather duster with a group symbol or a distinctive handkerchief tucked in your pocket, your gang has a signature accessory. |
| 3 | **Infamy**. Your group is linked to an infamous crime, one that remains the talk of the town. |
| 4 | **Idols**. A certain type of person finds criminals alluring, and your band has acquired a group of such hangers-on. They're not criminals themselves, just outsiders who admire you for your brutality, cunning, or flair. |
| 5 | **Legitimate**. The Boromar Clan has a legitimate front, though everyone knows the truth behind it. You're part of that facade of legitimacy, but you have a reputation for getting away with (literal) murder. |
| 6 | **Legends**. You have an air of mystery, and people whisper that you command strange powers. True or not, this reputation keeps people out of your way. |

### Rival Outfit
Some criminals believe you can't do a job without betraying your partners. Perhaps you have your own share of adversaries you've angered. The Group Rivals table presents a host of groups and individuals who might—legitimately or otherwise—hold a grudge against you.

##### Group Rivals
| d6 | Rival |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **The Law**. Someone in the Sharn Watch has vowed to put you in prison or die trying. |
| 2 | **Gang War**. Some members of a rival syndicate (such as Daask, House Tarkanan, or the Tyrants) hate you, probably for good reason. |
| 3 | **The Press**. Your group's adventures make for great headlines. Your every move is reported in the broadsheets and your steps are dogged by journalists. |
| 4 | **Infighting**. Another group within the Boromar Clan is jealous of your success or angry about a past wrong. They do everything they can to undercut you. |
| 5 | **Vigilante**. A citizen you wronged has sworn vengeance. Around any corner, you might find yourself facing a vigilante or a posse of angry citizens out for your blood. |
| 6 | **The Bosses**. The halfling family in control of the syndicate has its eye on you, taking pains to keep you in line and make sure you stay loyal. |

### Crime Syndicate Contacts
Everyone has a well-defined place in the Boromar Clan hierarchy. You report to a contact who oversees your work, giving you assignments, and collecting the syndicate's cut. This person might be a criminal mastermind who plans all your exploits, or they could leave the planning to your group. In any case, the Syndicate Contact table can help you define the personality of this contact.

##### Syndicate Contact
| d8 | Contact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A surrogate parent who views you as challenging but beloved children |
| 2 | A no-nonsense boss who treats the syndicate's work as just another business |
| 3 | A hardened criminal with no mercy, no patience, and no moral compass |
| 4 | A former urchin, now fabulously wealthy, who wants to see everyone in the syndicate find the same success |
| 5 | The boss at a gambling den or similar house of vice who enjoys the business just a little too much |
| 6 | A kind-hearted crook who's grateful to finally be able to delegate the dirty work on the streets to you |
| 7 | A miserable cynic who only cares about how much money you bring in to the syndicate |
| 8 | A former law enforcement officer who is full of cheerful tips for avoiding the law |

### Other Crime Syndicates
The city of Sharn is unusual in that it is home to no less than four powerful syndicates, which somehow have not yet managed to wipe each other out. The Boromar Clan is one crime syndicate, while the others include the following groups:

>> ##### Voice of Breland—Blood ADDICTS' Dragon Drug
>>Imagine it: a long-lasting state of euphoria, a feeling of power and energy, a measurable impact on certain magical powers, and the risk of addiction and deadly overdose with every use. That's the thrill of the drug called dragon's blood, which currently enjoys skyrocketing popularity in Sharn. Every day the death toll from this mysterious substance rises among "blood addicts." And no wonder, as it's produced in Droaam and sold in drams or "veins" by the monstrous thugs of Daask, who surely seek nothing less than to destroy the prosperity of Sharn but targeting its most precious resource: its sober, hardworking people. Remember friends, "Stay on the wagon. Say NO to dragon!"
>>

**Daask**. Daask is an aggressive criminal organization with cells across Khorvaire. Led by monstrous immigrants from Droaam—gnolls, harpies, medusas, minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and others—the group is ultimately under the command of Sora Katra, one of the rulers of Droaam. Physical violence is its specialty, but Daask also dabbles in illegal drugs.

**House Tarkanan**. House Tarkanan is known as a small order of highly skilled assassins and thieves in Sharn. Less well known is the fact that this guild consists primarily of criminals who bear aberrant dragonmarks—hence its choice of namesake, as Lord Halas Tarkanan united the bearers of these marks during the ancient War of the Mark.

**The Tyrants**. The Tyrants are a mysterious group of shapeshifters who traffic in all manner of information. They sell secrets, blackmail powerful people, and forge everything from identification papers to coins and works of art.

**Running Your Own**. Rather than join an existing syndicate, you can start your own. You need to establish your own headquarters and direct the activities of the 3d6 criminals who work for you. By claiming a 15 percent share of their take, you can rely on an income that will sustain you at a modest lifestyle, plus an additional 1d6 gp in profit per week. You can access contraband and fences as described earlier in this section, but you don't get a discount at syndicate-owned businesses unless you acquire some businesses of your own. You can also use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your syndicate.

## Dragonmarked House
Your group works for one of the most influential organizations in Khorvaire: the dragonmarked houses. Whether or not any member of your group carries a dragonmark or is even related to one of the houses by blood, you act on behalf of a house to advance its interests. You might function openly as representatives of the house, wearing its badge and exerting its authority, or you could be covert or unacknowledged agents.

The thirteen dragonmarked houses are described in detail earlier in this chapter.

### Patron Benefits
With a dragonmarked house as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:

**Compensation**. Your patron house pays you for the work you do on its behalf. On average, the house pays each member of your group an amount equal to 10 gp × the average level of your characters per day you spend on the mission.

**House Services**. When you require the services provided by your patron house, you can secure them at a discounted rate (10 percent off the normal charge). You might also be able to trade in a favor to get extraordinary services or a larger discount.

**Independence**. Each member of your group is issued papers that identifies you as agents of your patron house. Because the dragonmarked houses are bound to political neutrality by the terms of the ancient Korth Edicts, these papers guarantee you the right to travel freely across national borders on the business of your patron house. (If you assert that you are on the business of the house, even if you aren't, border agents are unlikely to challenge you.)

### Build Your Group
Dragonmarked houses employ adventurers who suit their needs. The roles characters play in a group with a dragonmarked house patron often have more to do with their relationship to the house than with the specific roles in the party. Consider some or all of these roles for your characters:

**Adventurer**. Some characters are associated with your patron house because of their connection to its ruling family or its businesses. The Adventurer, though, is hired by the house for more traditional adventuring skills—usually capabilities that the house's other agents lack. The Adventurer might have a wide range of abilities, particular to whatever needs the House has at the time. Many with peculiar skills or highly specific fields of expertise find themselves in the employ of dragonmarked houses or house members with eccentric interests and deep pockets.

**Guilder**. Every dragonmarked house is more than a single family. Each house encompasses at least one guild that operates just like a traditional craft or trade guild, and hundreds of people associate with these guilds while having no other relationship to the houses that oversee them. The Guilder is among these, perhaps being a skilled physician or cleric in House Jorasco's Healers Guild, for example, or an inquisitive associated with House Tharashk's Finders Guild. The Guilder might have the guild artisan background or some other set of skills suited to the specialties of your patron house's guilds.

**Heir**. The Heir is a member of your dragonmarked house patron, related by blood and carrying the house name. This character most likely chooses the race that matches the bloodline of the house. The Heir can be dragonmarked (with the appropriate marked subrace or racial variant) or unmarked. The house agent background (described in this chapter) proves particularly appropriate for this character.

### House Missions
Your group and your DM should decide together which house employs you. The nature of the missions you undertake depends in part on the house or guild you work for, but there are general categories of work that every house needs agents to perform on its behalf. The House Missions table provides suggestions for which house might employ you along with multiple possibilities for adventures that overlap with their interests. For the more general kind of work you might carry out on behalf of any dragonmarked house, consult the General House Missions table.

##### General House Missions
| d8 | Mission |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Establish a safe location for a house enclave in a hostile environment. |
| 2 | Find the wreckage of a crashed vehicle (airship, lightning rail car, sailing ship, or other) carrying house property. |
| 3 | Retrieve assets from a house enclave in the Mournland. |
| 4 | Protect a leader of your house from an anticipated assassination attempt. |
| 5 | Enforce your house's territory by preventing a rival from stealing its business. |
| 6 | Find a trove of dragonshards for your patron house to use. |
| 7 | Recruit a renowned sage to join the house's team of researchers. |
| 8 | Persuade a hostile tribe to agree to a trade agreement with your patron house. |

##### House Missions
| d12 | House | Mission 1 | Mission 2 | Mission 3 |
|:---:|:---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cannith | Escort a valuable shipment of goods | Track down rare materials | Advance the cause of one branch of the family at the expense of the other two |
| 2 | Deneith | Act as bodyguards for a prominent or wealthy person | Serve as mercenaries in a lingering border conflict | Enforce the law across national borders as Sentinel Marshals |
| 3 | Ghallanda | Establish useful diplomatic contacts | Acquire rare ingredients or recipes | Defend a Golden Dragon Inn that is under attack |

| 8 | Orien | Carry a sensitive message to its destination | Retrieve an important package stolen from another courier | Investigate a problem on a lightning rail line |
| 9 | Phiarlan and Thuranni | Sneak into a secret area to serve as the target of a scrying spell | Steal plans for a powerful new weapon | Carry out an assassination |
| 10 | Sivis | Mediate a tense negotiation | Assure that two parties keep to the terms of their agreement | Break a code used during the Last War |

| 12 | Vadalis | Capture wild animals and tame them | Prevent magebred specimens from upsetting a delicate ecosystem | Handle the animals drawing a massive caravan across the continent |

### House Status
Politics within a dragonmarked house can be vicious. Perhaps your the house leadership's favorite scion. Perhaps you've been exiled from your house for misdeeds—your own or another's. In any case, use the Group Status table to determine your party's standing within the organization.

##### Group Status
| d4 | Status |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Favored**. You have access to the leadership of the house, owing to your record of faithful service. |
| 2 | **Reliable**. You are reliable contributors to the house, and can count on it for help in difficult situations. |
| 3 | **Oddballs**. You don't quite fit in, and tend to draw strange assignments or those that other operatives pass up. |
| 4 | **Outcast**. You have made some mistakes in the recent past, and your status in the house is tenuous at best. |

### Dragonmarked House Contacts
Your primary contact within your patron house is another house agent—perhaps a dragonmarked heir, another family member, or a guild leader. Some contacts are devoted to the house and its interests, while others might use your group to pursue a personal agenda. Consult the House Contacts table to determine what sort of arbiter oversees your party.

##### House Contacts
| d8 | Contact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A lesser guild functionary who is cowed by your group (especially if it includes a dragonmarked character) and apologetic about giving you assignments |
| 2 | The stern and demanding parent of one (or more) of the characters in your group |
| 3 | The lovingly indulgent parent of a character in your group |
| 4 | The smugly superior dragonmarked sibling of an unmarked member of the family in your group |
| 5 | The money-minded business manager of a guild within your patron house |
| 6 | A retired adventurer within the family who would rather join you on your adventures than assign them to you |
| 7 | The proud leader of a regional branch of the dragonmarked family |
| 8 | The patriarch or matriarch of the patron house |

### The Twelve
Rather than working for one single house, your group could work for an organization that serves them all: the Twelve. This is a good option if you want to be involved in the intrigue among the dragonmarked houses while playing characters who come from different houses.

>> ##### The Korranberg Chronicle—Feud within the Twelve?
>>Reports emerged this week of bitter disputes within the Twelve, the arcane institution that supposedly embodies the spirit of cooperation among the houses. According to a source that wished to remain anonymous, a special meeting of the Committee of Twelve was called last week to address accusations that researchers connected to House Kundarak had been diverting funds from the institute's budget to fund their own private projects, then concealing the results of those projects from their colleagues. Kundarak's representative, according to our source, denied the accusations, saying that the researchers are operating within their allotted budget and keeping their results secret only temporarily, as a matter of house security.
>>
>>This matter is far from resolved, as the council meeting devolved into shouted arguments before disbanding. Representatives of House Medani and House Tharashk were particularly vocal in denouncing Kundarak, leaving this reporter to wonder whether a schism within the Council of Twelve might be imminent—and what that might mean for peaceful relations among the dragonmarked houses themselves.
>>

The Twelve facilitates communication and cooperation among the dragonmarked houses. As part of the agreements that ended the War of the Mark, the houses agreed to create an institute for the application of magic—a foundation that would study dragonmarks, along with more traditional forms of magic. Over the centuries, the Twelve has been responsible for many magical advances, including the airships operated by House Lyrandar and the message stations of House Sivis

As an arm of the dragonmarked houses, the Twelve attempted to remain neutral during the Last War, but many of its wizards and artificers had national loyalties that were stronger than their ties to the institute. Now that the Twelve has resumed normal operations, it seeks to replace its lost members and make sure that each house is represented.

While the Twelve provides a way for your group to work for multiple dragonmarked houses, its goals and benefits are similar to those of an individual house. Consider using the following details as a template if there's a particular dragonmarked house you wish to serve.

***Patronage.*** As a patron, the Twelve is functionally similar to a dragonmarked house. Rather than advancing one house's interests, though, the Twelve seeks to advance magical developments that have practical value to society as well as potential for profit. All the houses contribute to the operating budget of the institute, and in theory they all benefit from the results of its research.

As agents of the Twelve, you might undertake missions intended to help one house at a time or all of them at once, typically with a focus on magical research or problem-solving. Members of your group might have different status within their houses, but within the Twelve you're held as equals. The Twelve pay you (see "*Patron Benefits*"), and as their agents, you receive a 5 percent discount on services from all the dragonmarked houses (rather than a 10 percent discount from one house).

***Leadership.*** The Committee of Twelve oversees the institute. It currently has fifteen members, though its membership is a matter of significant disagreement within the council. There are of course only twelve dragonmarks, but the Mark of Shadow is represented by two different houses, and House Cannith is currently fragmented into three branches, each of which has claimed a seat on the council.

The Twelve is headquartered in a many-spired keep that floats in the air above the city of Korth in Karrnath. Most researchers funded by the Twelve operate within this structure, but the institute occasionally pays grants to researchers whose promising work can't easily (or safely) be relocated inside the keep.

***Allies.*** With a long record of providing benefit to society at large, the Twelve is widely respected. Some of their closest allies include the following groups:

![[059-1-44.png|right|300]](Headquarters of the Twelve)

**Dragonmarked Houses**. Above all, the Twelve has the almost universal support of the dragonmarked houses, which provide the funding to support its continued operation. One of the few things that all the houses agree on is that the Twelve should be allowed to do its work in peace. Agents of the Twelve can count on at least a minimal level of assistance from the houses in case of dire need.

**King Kaius**. Not every nation shares the same goodwill toward the Twelve, but the institutes's location above the city of Korth makes its relationship with Karrnath particularly important. The kings of Karrnath have regularly sought council from the Twelve, and Kaius has not abandoned this practice. Agents of Karrnath's government are inclined to trust agents of the Twelve and side with them in times of trouble.

**Manifest Institute**. In the city of Sharn, the Twelve sponsors the research of a number of scholars who make a study of the manifest zone that links the city to the plane of Syrania. Loosely organized as the Manifest Institute, these researchers include representatives from House Cannith, House Lyrandar, House Orien, and others, as well as those who work directly for the Twelve. The institute evaluates ways that the manifest zone might improve life in Sharn, seeks a deeper understanding of manifest zones in general, and plans contingencies in the event that the manifest zone ever evaporates.

***Enemies.*** Most enemies of the Twelve are individuals with grudges against the institute, which often stem from hurt feelings over being excluded from it. Those noted here number among the Twelve's fiercest foes:

**Arcane Congress**. Established by King Galifar I expressly to serve as a political answer to the Twelve, the Arcane Congress competes with the Twelve over resources and students. Some would argue that the ongoing rivalry encourages both institutions toward more and better arcane discoveries, but the animosity sometimes escalates to sabotage and researchers taking excessive risks.

**Mordain the Fleshweaver**. Not many personal grudges jeopardize the Twelve, but when a powerful wizard feels slighted, the impact can be significant. The elf wizard Mordain was banished from the Twelve more than two centuries ago because of his disturbing experiments related to the magic of the daelkyr. He dwells in Droaam now, focused on his research and plotting revenge. His reach isn't long, but agents of the Twelve avoid Droaam if at all possible.

## Espionage Agency
Secret agents, spies, undercover operatives—your group is part of an organization engaged in espionage. Most such agencies are attached to governments or dragonmarked houses, gathering information on the activities and plans of rival nations, houses, and businesses. Naturally, your affiliation with an espionage agency is a secret; you can't advertise that connection, and if you get in trouble with law enforcement forces (especially in foreign nations), your home nation will disavow you and deny any knowledge of your activities.

It's said the Last War was fought as much by spies as by armies. Espionage agencies in every nation sought secrets to bring military supremacy to their own lands and provide dominance over their neighbors. In the years since the end of the war, a clandestine struggle among these agencies (which the *Korranberg Chronicle* dubbed the Shadow War) has continued unabated, just outside of the public eye.

### King's Dark Lanterns
The King's Dark Lanterns is the intelligence division of the King's Citadel, an organization sworn to defend Breland from its enemies and dispense justice in the name of King Boranel. As the secret servants of the crown, members of the organization are granted the authority to conduct intelligence operations on foreign soil, execute covert missions across the globe, and prevent national secrets from falling into the hands of rival intelligence agencies. The Dark Lanterns also have an unwritten license to eliminate any creature that threatens their nation, its sovereign, or its citizens.

***Headquarters.*** The King's Citadel is based in Breland's capital city of Wroat, under the command of the king's brother, Lord Kor ir'Wynarn. A changeling named Captain Vron serves as the leader of the Dark Lanterns, with four subordinate knights marshal leading branch offices across Breland, in Sharn, Starilaskur, and Xandrar. A much smaller branch office keeps an eye on Brelish interests in the city of Stormreach, in Xen'drik. Small, temporary field offices are sometimes established to coordinate missions outside Breland; these offices double as safe houses for agents in trouble, and they are designed to be wiped clean at a moment's notice if discovered by local authorities.

The Sharn office of the King's Citadel is in Andith Tower in the Ambassador Towers district. Though a knight marshal commands the office, most of the King's Citadel members in Sharn are Dark Lanterns, and thus under the authority of a scheming and ruthless gnome named Talleon Haliar Tonan.

![[060-1-45.png|right|300]]

***Agents.*** The King's Dark Lanterns includes more than 500 agents operating within Breland's borders and roughly one-fifth that number stationed abroad. They often work in teams, and also work closely with the other divisions of the Citadel. Sometimes they recruit local talent, often under false pretenses, to help them accomplish their missions in foreign lands.

***Allies.*** By their nature, espionage agencies must be cautious in choosing their allies, and the King's Dark Lanterns is no exception. Its most trustworthy allies include the following facets of the Brelish government:

**King Boranel**. The King's Dark Lanterns, as one would expect, serve the king of Breland, and he is their greatest advocate and ally. The king views loyalty as mutual: as long as an agent's loyalty is irreproachable, Boranel is willing to exercise his considerable power on that agent's behalf.

**The King's Citadel**. The Citadel has three branches besides the Dark Lanterns. The King's Swords are elite special combat forces. The King's Shields protect the king and his closest family members and associates. The King's Wands provide magical support to the other branches of the Citadel as well as other Brelish forces. Some Dark Lanterns might think themselves superior to members of the other branches, but even so they recognize other Citadel agents as players on the same team. When your group needs a little extra help, the other branches of the Citadel are there for you.

***Enemies.*** Rare is the espionage agency that is loved. Even within Breland, the populace views the Dark Lanterns with suspicion, and powerful people outside the royal family harbor resentment at the influence of the Citadel. Many people and institutions outside Breland view the Dark Lanterns as a hostile force. As a result, the following groups account for just a few enemies of the Dark Lanterns:

**Brelish Populists**. As much as King Boranel is loved in his country, many Brelish voices argue that the era of monarchy is at an end, and the throne of Breland should be replaced by a government democratically elected by the citizenry. When these forces grow restless enough to plot and riot, the Citadel—and often the Dark Lanterns—work to bring them to heel. As a result, those who question the authority of the king are the most likely Brelish citizens to mistrust the Dark Lanterns or view them with open hostility. According to rumor some of those people even hold high positions in the Brelish government.

**Foreign Nations**. Every nation knows the King's Dark Lanterns serves as an espionage force and do their best to track the movements of Dark Lantern agents within their borders. Foreign governments treat Dark Lantern agents with care to avoid sparking an international incident, but they are quick to arrest Dark Lantern agents suspected of wrongdoing.

**New Cyre**. One of the world's largest concentrations of Cyran refugees settled in eastern Breland under the leadership of Oargev ir'Wynarn, the last prince of Cyre. Many voices among the Cyrans, possibly including Oargev himself, call for the establishment of an independent nation in what is now Brelish territory, but Boranel is determined to hold on to every acre of his land. The Dark Lanterns actively infiltrate the Cyran refugee community, rooting out those who would act against the king.

### Patron Benefits
You gain the following benefits when your group's patron is an espionage agency:

**Assignments**. Your agency might assign you specific tasks at any time, at the DM's discretion. You have wide latitude regarding how you carry out a task, and your assignments can sometimes be very broad and require considerable time to complete.

**Expense Account**. You have access to an account maintained at the banks of House Kundarak. You can use this account to pay your daily living expenses, as well as for purchasing anything you need for completing your missions—equipment, transportation, bribes, and so on. Your normal spending limit is 100 gp per month for each member of your group. If you exceed that, your agency asks you to account for the month's expenses, and they might require you to pay back the excess if you can't justify it (at the DM's discretion). You can't carry over an unused amount from one month to the next, and your access to this account can be cut off at any time if you abuse it or fall out of the agency's good graces. The agency is aware of every time you access the account and where you are when you do so.

**Identification**. Your agency provides you with identification papers establishing your true identity, and you also have ready access to false papers and matching travel documents showing different identities, when you need them for a mission. (Any time you enter a foreign nation, it is a good idea for you to do so under a false identity.)

**Powerful Friends**. An espionage agency, by nature, has a long reach and a lot of power to make things happen behind the scenes. You can call in a favor for a wide range of benefits: A legal case against you might be suddenly dropped. A rival might disappear. A much-needed magic item might be delivered to you. These favors can provide significant short-term benefit, but they can also come with equally significant long-term repercussions—which might lead to entirely new missions.

### Build Your Group
Espionage agents are typically both highly trained and tightly specialized. The type of missions you undertake can shape your group's composition; you might be a team of hunters or investigators, focused on tracking people down or gathering information. More likely, you're a diverse team with a range of skills that allow you undertake a variety of different missions on your patron's behalf. Consider some or all of these roles for the characters in your party:

**Chameleon**. A master of disguise, sleight of hand, and deception, the Chameleon can perform the work of the Investigator or a Confiscator right under a target's nose—or provide cover to agents with different specialties as they do their jobs. A high Charisma, proficiency with the disguise kit (or access to spells that cloak or disguise one's appearance), and proficiency with skills such as Deception, Performance, and Sleight of Hand all greatly benefit the Chameleon. Bards and rogues, as well as characters with the charlatan, entertainer, or urchin background, often excel in this role.

>>
>>A spokesperson for the King's Citadel vehemently denied reports that Drinn is employed by the Citadel.
>>

**Confiscator**. Sometimes an espionage agency needs something stolen—a document that incriminates a public figure to a prototype war machine. The Confiscator has the key skills for such jobs. A good Dexterity score proves helpful in undertaking such tasks, especially if it's enhanced with proficiency with thieves' tools and the Sleight of Hand and Stealth skills. Confiscators are often rogues, and many have a history of stealing for profit rather than national interest.

**Hunter**. The Hunter stalks humanoid prey, for purposes of assassination, abduction, or gathering information. A combination of combat prowess with stealth and interaction skills makes for well-prepared Hunters. Rangers and rogues prove particularly adept at this role, as might anyone with proficiency in the Investigation, Perception and Stealth skills. A high Charisma and proficiency in Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion skills can also be useful. Hunters often come from backgrounds such as outlander or urchin.

**Investigator**. The Investigator is the archetypal spy, a master of deductive reasoning and suave interaction. Naturally, Investigation can be a crucial skill, which many characters in this role combine with magical means of scrying to learn about their enemies and objectives. Bards and wizards make natural Investigators, especially if they can acquire one or more skills from among Deception, Perception, Persuasion, and Stealth. Investigators come from backgrounds as varied as charlatans, nobles, sages, and urchins.

**Operator**. An Operator leads or organizes a team of agents in the field. Like a military officer, the Operator issues orders and bears responsibility for the agents on the team. High Charisma and Intelligence scores help make the Operator a strong leader, especially in conjunction with skill proficiencies such as Persuasion and Investigation. The wide array of skills used by other agents are also valuable to the Operator, who might end up stepping into a different role when the need arises. The Operator is often a bard and might come from a soldier or noble background (being accustomed to leadership in one form or another).

**Saboteur**. The Saboteur interferes with the functioning of enemy assets. More than a reckless bomber, they combine a willingness to destroy with a knack for infiltration. Proficiency with thieves' tools and in skills such as Deception, Investigation, and Stealth often serve the work of sabotage. The Saboteur benefits from an understanding of craft and magic items, making artificers particularly skilled in this role. Guild artisans might also disguise tools of destruction as mundane objects or works of art. Many Saboteurs come from backgrounds such as charlatans or soldiers.

### Types of Espionage
Espionage activities can be classified in three broad categories: counterintelligence, covert action, and intelligence gathering. Your party might focus on one of those areas, or perhaps you're the team that handles situations that other teams bungle. As a group, work with your DM and consult the Espionage Missions table to decide what kinds of missions you might undertake.

##### Espionage Missions
| d6 | Mission |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Information Gathering**. If information is out there, you can find it and hand it over to your patron. |
| 2 | **Counterintelligence**. Your work focuses on finding, opposing, and eliminating enemy intelligence agents. |
| 3 | **Misinformation**. You are experts at creating false stories and bogus information to foil enemy spies. |
| 4 | **Covert Elimination**. When you disappear someone you leave behind no evidence. |
| 5 | **Disruption**. You excel at infiltration and wreaking havoc via blackmail, misinformation, and subversion. |
| 6 | **Sabotage**. You slip into places, lay the seeds for their destruction, and escape without detection. |

### Secrets
Most likely, your espionage work will eventually put you in possession of secrets others don't want you to know. When the time comes, consult the Secrets table to determine what clandestine knowledge your group possesses, and how it might make life complicated for you.

##### Secrets
| d6 | Secret |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Blackmail Material**. You have evidence of a career-ending secret concerning an important figure. |
| 2 | **Hidden Agenda**. You are party to a conspiracy that seeks to influence events to better suit your desires. |
| 3 | **Careful Balance**. You have damning information on your patron agency, but it has carefully collected equally damaging secrets on all of you. |
| 4 | **Conspiracy**. A local organization, such as a guild, government, or dragonmarked house, is engaged in dirty deeds, and you have inside information on them. |
| 5 | **Deep Cover**. You know the secret identity of a seemingly innocent but powerful person who would rather remain anonymous. |
| 6 | **Empty Threats**. Rumors say you collect damaging secrets on anyone, and people tread carefully around you as a result. The truth is that your reputation is overblown, so you have your own secret to keep safe. |

### Memorable Mission
You engaged in a mission that still overshadows your work. Was it the perfect operation, or do you still carry scars from a mission gone horribly wrong? Consult the Memorable Mission table to determine the details of your career-defining exploit.

##### Memorable Mission
| d4 | Mission |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Betrayal**. A former associate turned against you. You escaped, and want revenge. |
| 2 | **Left in the Cold.** Things went wrong, and you had to make the terrible decision to abandon an ally. They might be dead, or they might be looking for revenge. |
| 3 | **The Perfect Operation**. Your actions made headlines across Khorvaire, shaping history for the next decade. Nobody knows you were involved, and sometimes you wish you could have a little credit for your work. |
| 4 | **The Standoff**. You met your match during a tense operation. Neither side got everything they wanted. You hate to admit it, but the team you went up against proved your match. Maybe you'll cross paths again. |

### Espionage Agency Contacts
Your assignments come from a superior in the agency who typically works at a desk rather than in the field—compiling intelligence into reports for their superiors and coordinating the activities of multiple groups. Use the Agency Contacts table to determine the character of your superior, which can shape the kinds of missions you undertake and the degree of support you receive.

##### Agency Contacts
| d8 | Contact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A condescending career desk agent who views you as expendable tools |
| 2 | A bitter former field agent, now confined to a field office, who envies your work |
| 3 | A kindly bureau chief who views you as a truly special team with invaluable skills |
| 4 | A crotchety middle-manager on the cusp of retirement who constantly bemoans the state of today's agents compared to those in the "good old days" |
| 5 | A hotheaded former soldier who would prefer a return to open warfare instead of this so-called "Shadow War" |
| 6 | A battle-scarred field agent who would do almost anything to prevent a return to the horrors of the Last War |
| 7 | A bored but effective manager who refuses to be impressed by anything you do or shocked by anything that happens to you |
| 8 | A mysterious voice on the other end of a *speaking stone* |

### Other Espionage Agencies
Every nation has some form of espionage agency, and two of the dragonmarked houses (House Phiarlan and House Thuranni) include specialized espionage forces as part of their businesses. Besides the King's Dark Lanterns, some of Khorvaire's more prominent espionage agencies include the following groups:

**Argentum**. The Argentum is a ministry within the Church of the Silver Flame. Originally dedicated to the acquisition, study, and redistribution of magic items and artifacts, it was repurposed during the Last War to serve as Thrane's espionage agency.

**Royal Eyes**. Aundair is renowned for its wizards, and the Royal Eyes of Aundair excel at spellcraft and divination—almost every agent of the Royal Eyes has an arcane advantage. Agents spy on other nations, pursue notorious criminals, and engage in a host of other wand-and-dagger missions for the crown.

**Serpentine Table**. The Serpentine Table is the espionage arm of House Phiarlan. Few people outside the house even know of its existence, and hardly any of its lower-level operatives realize the full implication of their service. They simply collect and pass along information, never knowing how it is used.

**The Trust**. Zilargo's secret police, the Trust maintains order in the service of the Triumvirate. This web of spies and ruthless assassins are known for their operations in Zilargo, but few realize that the Trust is also active in nations across Khorvaire. The gnomes believe knowledge is the greatest weapon of all, and Trust agents endlessly search for secrets that could prove useful to their nation.

## Head of State
Your group serves a national ruler. You're not simply a member of a military organization or an espionage agency (both of which are different patrons described in this section); you have the ear of a sovereign and you are expected to help them attain their goals at all costs.

### Prince Oargev of New Cyre
The disaster of the Mourning wiped out much of the population of Cyre, but those living near the western border had time to cross into the Brelish countryside ahead of the strange wall of gray mist that now shrouds the Mournland. King Boranel of Breland took pity on the refugees and established camps for them, camps which have now grown into the town of New Cyre.

The mayor of New Cyre is Prince Oargev ir'Wynarn, the last son of Cyre's ruling family. He was serving as an ambassador to Breland at the time of the Mourning, and Cyran refugees across Khorvaire now look to him for leadership as a sort of king in exile. He hopes to one day gather all of Cyre's displaced children to a rebuilt Cyre.

Prince Oargev is obsessed with the Mourning. He is desperate to discover the truth behind the destruction of his country. He regularly seeks information from those who venture into the Mournland, and he funds expeditions into the remains of his once-proud nation, hoping to discover some clue as to the cause of Cyre's demise.

***Allies.*** Prince Oargev has a gift for diplomacy (and a number of talented ambassadors in his employ), which has enabled a widespread campaign of outreach to Cyran refugees across Khorvaire. He has a great deal of popular sympathy, as well as allies in every nation, including the following groups and individuals:

**King Boranel**. The ruler of Breland did a great kindness to the people of Cyre by establishing the refugee camps that have grown into New Cyre. Oargev has not forgotten that kindness, and he would prefer not to jeopardize his friendship with Boranel by seizing land from Breland. However, rumors persist that Oargev plans to secede, and the King's Dark Lanterns frequently send agents into New Cyre to keep an eye on anti-Brelish sentiment. Oargev wisely views Boranel as an ally, but knows Breland could be a threat.

**Q'barra**. Aside from New Cyre, the largest population of Cyran refugees resides in Q'barra. Oargev has invited these displaced Cyrans to join him in New Cyre, but most of them have started putting down new roots in the jungle land. If Cyre could be reclaimed from the Mournland, many of them would probably return; in the meantime, they are a friendly force in the east, willing to offer shelter and aid to agents of Prince Oargev who find themselves among the settlements of Q'barra.

**Refugees**. Cyrans live across Khorvaire in the wake of the Last War. Oargev does significant work in reaching out to his displaced subjects, and the majority of them sympathize with his goals and aid his agents.

***Enemies.*** Bitter Cyran avengers who punish those they believe responsible for the Mourning have cast shadows on Prince Oargev's reputation. As a result, the following groups consider Prince Oargev their foe:

**The Five Nations**. Aundairians, Karrns, and Thranes are generally unsympathetic to the plight of displaced Cyrans. Many of them bitterly bear the scars of the war, their resentments reinforced by the deeds of violent Cyran extremists. Even the Brelish, for all their practiced indifference, become guarded when confronted by Cyrans, who represent a burden foisted upon them by their leaders. They tend to treat Cyran refugees as second-class citizens and vagabonds. Among non-Cyran communities, agents of Prince Oargev can't rely on aid from any of Cyre's former enemies.

**The Lord of Blades.** In the depths of the Mournland, the closest thing to a sovereign is **the Lord of Blades**—a heavily enhanced warforged who seeks vengeance against those who created his people to serve as weapons. He is hostile to adventurers who enter the Mournland on missions of plunder, and the idea of Prince Oargev reclaiming the Mournland fills him with fury. He shows Oargev's agents no mercy.

### Patron Benefits
With a head of state as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:

>> ##### Voice of Breland—Pauper Prince Plots bandit barony
>>Prince Oargev, the exiled Cyran royal who governs the town of New Cyre by the sufferance of King Boranel, is planning a brazen act of secession, hoping to transform all of eastern Breland into a new Cyran realm, sources say. According to a group of adventurers recently employed by Oargev, the prince sent them into the Mournland to recover weapons of war so they could be wielded against the Brelish military during the secession. How will King Boranel respond to this treachery? Will the nations come to the defense of the displaced prince? Will Oargev's scheming result in all of eastern Breland being swathed in the same gray mist that consumed Cyre?
>>

**Assignments**. Your work is performed at the direction of your patron. That means you are usually under assignment and not entirely free to choose your own course. Depending on the ruler and the task, these assignments can be directive or more hands-off, as you pursue long-term goals.

**Expenses**. In addition to your salary, your patron reimburses you for extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. You are required to account for your expenses and might be called on to explain any extraordinary expenditures, but routine travel, ordinary equipment, and most services don't draw a second glance.

**Immunity**. As long as you remain in the head of state's good graces, you are nearly immune to prosecution under the laws of your home country. Committing serious crimes—especially if they are unrelated or unnecessary for the work you've been assigned—is a good way to fall out of your patron's good graces, however. When you are carrying out your orders within your nation's borders, though, you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to do that, and the law isn't an obstacle. (However, note that agents of Prince Oargev can't necessarily expect the same clemency in Breland outside of New Cyre.)

**Salary**. Your employment for a head of state brings you an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion, your salary might increase or decrease depending on which particular head of state you work for, the nature of your work, and the length of your employment.

### Build Your Group
A head of state like Prince Oargev requires a variety of adventurers to do the range of tasks they require. Depending on the kinds of work you do, your party might include some or all of these roles:

![[061-1-46.png|right|300]](Prince Oargev Ir'wynarn)

**Civil Servant**. The vast majority of work performed on behalf of a head of state has very little to do with deadly adventure: it's about prosecuting and judging criminals in the courts of law, hearing the petitions and complaints of citizens, collecting taxes, and interminable amounts of paperwork. Once in a while, though, a faithful Civil Servant gets forcefully pulled from this work and thrust into life-or-death situations, with or without help from more hardened adventurers. The knowledge and experience of a Civil Servant can often be useful, with some developing skills as clerics, rogues, wizards, or other classes. Such characters often come from the sage background and have proficiency in skills that reflect their studies, such as Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion.

**Diplomat**. Negotiating treaties, de-escalating conflicts, and issuing ultimatums are tasks that fall within the purview of the Diplomat, who typically puts their high Charisma to work in the service of the state. These characters often come from a noble background and bring proficiency in skills such as Intimidation and Persuasion to their work. Bards are natural fits in this role, as are paladins—as long as they aren't asked to do things that violate the tenets of their oaths.

**Marshal**. Combat is the specialty of the Marshal, who focuses on enforcing the law of the land and bringing fugitives to justice. Fighters and paladins make natural Marshals, many being former soldiers who continue fighting the Last War in different venues. They often have reasonable Intelligence scores or proficiency in Investigation.

**Warden**. The Warden's focus isn't so much on the people of the nation, but on the land encompassed within its borders, both cultivated and wild. Sometimes that extends to protecting the border from incursions, but more often a Warden contend with monstrosities and wild beasts that threaten the populace, magical corruption that harms the land, and disasters jeopardizing the nation as a whole. Wardens are often rangers or druids, with proficiency in Nature and Perception. They might come from backgrounds as outlanders or hermits, making them more comfortable in the wilds than in cities or royal courts.

### National Affairs
Sometimes there's a fine line between the missions assigned by a head of state and those of an espionage agency or a military force, but your team's central focus is politics. As a group, consult the Cyran Affairs table and work with your DM to decide what kinds of adventures you undertake on behalf of Prince Oargev. The Heads of State table at the end of the section offers additional options for leaders who might make appealing patrons.

##### Cyran Affairs
| d6 | Mission |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Convince nations to recognize Oargev as a sovereign |
| 2 | Work diplomatically to secure land for a Cyran nation |
| 3 | Track down agents and infiltrators from other nations who are acting against New Cyre's interests |
| 4 | Venture into the Mournland to salvage Cyran treasures |
| 5 | Aid Cyran refugees in Breland and elsewhere |
| 6 | Make incriminating or embarrassing evidence about the prince quietly disappear |

### Official Status
Heads of state employ a variety of agents. Some are officially recognized, but others are expected to operate on the borders of legality. Consult the State Status table to determine the nature of your group's work

##### State Status
| d6 | Status |
|:---:|---|
| 1–3 | **Official**. You hold an official position and are recognized as attached to your patron. You can expect the head of state's support, but you must also ensure your actions avoid staining your patron's reputation. |
| 4–5 | **Shadow**. You can expect no official, public recognition of your work, but the head of state you work for does acknowledge you in private and provide help. |
| 6 | **Double**. Your allegiance lies with an official or government other than the one you overtly serve. You may receive support from the head of state you openly answer follow, as well as the official you secretly report to, but must remain on constant guard against having your true loyalties revealed. |

### Head of State Contacts
Often, your connection to your patron is quite direct—the head of state summons you, grants you an audience, and gives you an assignment or hears your report. Heads of state are busy people, though, and if your business isn't pressing, you might be handled by a functionary of the court. The State Contacts table provides several options for what functionaries your group might work with when the head of state is indisposed.

##### State Contacts
| d8 | Contact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A disapproving courtier who finds your extrajudicial work highly distasteful |
| 2 | A fawning sycophant who figures you are the best path to the head of state's good graces |
| 3 | A wide-eyed bureaucrat who dreams of living a life as exciting and dangerous as yours |
| 4 | A scheming relative of the head of state who sees you as a path toward seizing power |
| 5 | A bored chancellor who is constantly irritated at the amount of money you spend |
| 6 | A grumpy ex-adventurer who was "promoted" from doing your job to supervising you |
| 7 | A worried parental figure who is sure that every mission will be your last |
| 8 | The ghost of the previous head of state |

### Other Heads of State
The head of almost any nation described in chapter 2 could be your patron. For some nations and regions, it's impossible to speak of a "head of state," but you might enjoy the patronage of a powerful clan leader or other prominent figure—perhaps working to make that person a viable head of state in the long run.

The Heads of State table offers suggestions for the kind of work you might do for other national leaders in Khorvaire, if Prince Oargev isn't your patron.

##### Heads of State
| d20 | Patron and Missions |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | As representatives of the Sibling Kings of Aerenal, secure trade pacts with the nations of Khorvaire. |
| 2–3 | As agents of Queen Aurala, help her build Aundair's strength in preparation for the next war, without alerting other nations to her ambitions. |
| 4–5 | Assist the Brelish crown in dealing with matters beyond the capabilities of local law enforcement. |
| 6 | As emissaries of Darguun's Lhesh Haruuc, work to build respect for Darguun as a nation. |
| 7 | As agents of the Daughters of Sora Kell, keep the powerful Droaamite warlords in line and strengthen support for your fledging nation. |
| 8–9 | Patrol the forests of the Eldeen Reaches on guard against threats, particularly those coming from the Demon Wastes to the west. |
| 10–11 | Crack down on the Order of the Emerald Claw's activities in Karrnath. |
| 12 | Strengthen the ties between the Lhazaar princes while ensuring your prince comes out on top. |
| 13 | On behalf of a dwarf clan, search for artifacts in the underground realms below the Mror Holds. |
| 14 | Clear land for a new settlement in Q'barra, driving out the monsters that haunt the jungle location. |
| 15 | Unite several halfling tribes of the Talenta Plains under the banner of a single leader. |
| 16–17 | Combat forces of corruption within the Church of the Silver Flame, both in Thrane and abroad. |
| 18 | Gain glory for Valenar by leading raids and battling threats from the Mournland. |
| 19–20 | On behalf of one member of Zilargo's Triumvirate, collect information that could be used as leverage against the other two. |

## Immortal Being
A greater will than a mere mortal organization or nation drives your group. It is an ancient power of immortal majesty, and its purposes are cosmic and inscrutable.

### Sora Kell, the Queen of the Night
A mysterious figure who appears in lofty myths and children's fables, Sora Kell extends her reach across the world and through the myriad planes, claiming mystical knowledge by force and cunning. A mighty wizard with magic worthy of epic tales, she is a monster whose adamantine claws can flense whole armies before any soldier can land a blow on her plated hide. Tales of Sora Kell claim she is the first night hag, born from Khyber in the first age of the world alongside the ancient rakshasas. Some even claim that her daughters—the hags who rule Droaam—are either direct agents of her will or have trapped her and pursue their own goals.

One fact is indisputable: Sora Kell is an immortal being who employs mortals to do her bidding. In exchange, she trades lore from her boundless stores of magic items, racks of scrolls, libraries of ancient spells, maps of forgotten ruins, and tomes unveiling the mysteries of the multiverse, which she has secreted away in caches across the planes.

![[062-1-47.png|right|300]](Sora Kell and a Dreamer)

***Appearances.*** Unlike some other immortal patrons, Sora Kell's physical form has not been seen on Eberron for over a century. Perhaps she has set a task before her daughters and watches events unfold. Maybe she is trapped upon another plane of existence or is devising magic that could shake the foundations of existence. In any case, she appears in the dreams of her agents, or occasionally uses magical means to communicate, sometimes directly, other times through sinister omens.

***Allies.*** As a creature of legend, Sora Kell can hardly be said to have allies, except for a handful of other legends like the following groups:

**Daughters of Sora Kell.** Sora Kell's three daughters—the gifted oracle Sora Teraza, the cunning trickster Sora Katra, and the vicious monster Sora Maenya—rule the nation of Droaam, either to facilitate their own scheming or at their mother's command. Adventurers who enjoy the patronage of Sora Kell can impose on her daughters for aid if they should ever find themselves in or near Droaam. They can also count on the aid of Daask, a criminal gang in Sharn, which is controlled by Sora Katra.

**Lords of Dust**. Ancient fiends number among Sora Kell's allies—not the least of which are her daughters' three long-forgotten fathers. It isn't for Sora Kell's pawns to know which of the powerful villains are friendly to Sora Kell, but she occasionally sends adventurers to lend aid to rakshasas—often lesser fiends working to free the ancient overlords. Wise adventurers carefully weigh the rewards of working with such fiends against the costs—to themselves and the world.

***Enemies.*** Like most immortal beings, Sora Kell has many enemies, though the mortal ones barely merit her attention. For the most part, only beings like those that follow dare oppose Sora Kell:

**The Dreaming Dark**. In Sora Kell's estimation, the greatest threat to her are the quori of Dal Quor, and their minions, the Dreaming Dark. Fortunately for the adventurers that serve Sora Kell, few mortals register as worthy foes in the alien minds of the quori.

**Lords of Dust**. Sora Kell has allies among the Lords of Dust, but she also has bitter rivals. Like the quori, these fiends rarely pay much attention to Sora Kell's mortal minions, but they aren't above harming mortal adventurers just to spite her.

### Patron Benefits
The patronage of an immortal being is a relationship built on favors, not on employment or service. Your group does favors for your patron, and you can ask favors in return. These favors are the benefits you gain for having an immortal being as your group's patron, and they might include any of the following boons:

**Contacts**. Your group is almost certainly not the only one sponsored by your patron. Plans that span the world and the course of millennia require many agents to complete. If necessary, your patron can put you in contact with their other agents, who might be in a position to help you through status, influence, or magic.

**Information**. The most precious reward most immortals can give is a tidbit of their ages-spanning knowledge. Immortal beings often know secrets hidden from most mortals—including glimpses of possible futures. They don't usually share secrets freely, but they might reward your group for the completion of a mission with a hint, a puzzle, or a morsel of information that sets you off in pursuit of more.

**Magic**. Immortal beings often have access to vast stores of magic, including their own spells and secret caches of magic items. They are mindful of the value of this magic, and grant spells and items as rewards appropriate to the favor and the power of the adventurers.

> ##### The Draconic Prophecy as Group Patron
>Though it is not a sentient force that can control or reward your party, the Draconic Prophecy can be similar to an Immortal Being patron. The Prophecy can act as a guide for adventurers who seek to fulfill it—or to steer its fulfillment in a particular direction. You stand among the heroes of the present age; surely you have a role to play in the unfolding prophecy.
>
>In order for the Draconic Prophecy to work as a patron, one or more of the characters needs to have access to words from the Prophecy. Your group might adventure to seek out places where the Prophecy is written: mountainsides and cavern walls, ancient text and crumbling ruins, or the patterns of moons, stars, and the Ring of Siberys (best interpreted at an observatory). A dragonmarked character might gain insight into the Prophecy from the marks on their skin. Alternatively, a character might hear words from the Prophecy in dreams or visions, or surfacing from some deeply buried memory of a traumatic event.
>
>Given access to the words of the Prophecy, it's up to the characters to decide what they mean. The Prophecy is notoriously difficult to interpret, and a given passage might be fulfilled in different ways (or, possibly, in multiple ways over the course of centuries). For example, take a prophetic snippet like the one mentioned in the book's introduction: "If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his nation." This might mean that if King Boranel of Breland is killed in the Mournland, the kingdom of Breland will be dissolved, and if dissolving the monarchy is the characters' goal, they can try to bring about those circumstances. On the other hand, it could mean that if an awakened bear in the Eldeen Reaches declares himself king of the forest, and if the bear is killed on the anniversary of the Mourning, the tallest tree in the domain he claimed (the Crown of his nation) will fall. If that is the characters' goal, for whatever reason, they might try to bring those circumstances about.
>
>The currency of favors that defines most patronage relationships is tricky when your group's patron is a series of vague oracular verses rather than a person. However, bringing about the fulfillment of the Prophecy in a certain way often has immediate or long-term benefits that are equivalent to the favors another patron might grant your group. Toppling the Crown in the Bear King's domain might give you access to a spell inscribed in the ancient tree's rings, for example.
>

### Build Your Group
No common thread unites adventurers with an immortal patron, except perhaps uncommon openness to the mysterious and unknown. You haven't been chosen because of your capabilities; they might have been chosen to fulfill the words of a prophecy, because they were born at auspicious times and places, or because they happened to be in a particular place at a certain time. Individual characters in your group might have different relationships with your patron, though; consider some or all of these roles for your characters:

**Agent**. The Agent doesn't receive direct communications from an immortal patron, but puts faith in the dreams and inspiration of others, following such omens with an eager heart. This character is under no illusions of having a special role to play in the immortal's grand plans, but is ready to make sure those with such roles play them. This is often a character with no magical ability or sometimes from a scholarly background, such as a sage or hermit—perhaps someone familiar with lore about the immortal but not directly inspired by it. Agents typically have proficiency in skills such as Arcana, History, and Religion.

**Innocent**. Some characters have no intention of becoming adventurers and desire no connection to the machinations of the immortals, but they get caught up in schemes and prophecies anyway. The Innocent might have been identified as a key part of a prophecy, or made what seemed like an innocent bargain with a harmless old hermit, or found an artifact with mysterious powers. The folk hero background is ideal for the Innocent, combining humble origins with a sense of destiny. Any class or proficiencies are suited for this role.

**Visionary**. At least one character in the party should have a particular connection to your immortal patron. The Visionary might hear the patron's voice in dreams, see waking visions that convey the immortal's will, or interpret signs in accordance with prophecy. Different backgrounds might suggest different stories for a Visionary: An acolyte might have had a revelatory experience that paved the way for the immortal's communications. A hermit might have been plagued by disturbing dreams from youth. A sage might have made a lifetime study of the Draconic Prophecy. These characters are often clerics, druids, warlocks, or wizards, and typically proficient in skills such as Arcana and Religion.

### Serving an Immortal
The tasks you perform for your immortal patron can be mysterious, even trivial seeming, but they always have implications within the immortal's larger plans. Often it's hard to tell what those implications might be—and stumbling upon hints of an immortal's broader agenda might prove frightening. Your tasks could involve fulfilling prophecies in deliberate ways, preventing prophesied events from coming to pass, or even engaging in seemingly random actions that further designs invisible to mortal eyes. Immortal beings might send you on all manner of adventures, such as those shown on the Immortal Missions table.

##### Immortal Missions

| 3 | Ensure that the villain you are pursuing dies by falling from a great height, not by any other means. |
| 4 | Remove the obstacles that prevent a retired adventurer from marrying the nobleman she loves, so that their child can grow up to carry out another part of your patron's plan. |
| 5 | Plant a magical seed in a remote location to ensure it grows into a mighty tree and bears fruit that will give power to future heroes. |
| 6 | Defeat a dragon-blooded sorcerer who is doing the bidding of the Chamber—and wreaking havoc in Darguun in the process. |
| 7 | Destroy an eldritch machine, created by a rogue Cannith artificer, that is drawing on the energy of an imprisoned rakshasa—and that will, unknown to the inventor, lead to the rakshasa's release. |
| 8 | Protect a kalashtar monk who is being targeted by Dreaming Dark assassins as she studies a path that might eventually prevent the quori from projecting themselves into the Material Plane. |

### Immortal Contacts
Immortal beings sometimes use mortal intermediaries to contact their agents, but most of them possess magic powerful enough to communicate with you directly, even over impossible distances. Consult the Immortal Communication table to determine what mysterious method your patron uses to direct your party.

##### Immortal Communication
| d10 | Means of Contact |

>> ##### The Korranberg Chronicle—Eldeen FRACAS Fulfills Prophecy
>>"In the darkest night of the Dragon Below, storm and dragon are reunited, and they break together upon the legions of the Blasphemer." According to Thausil Kennar, a noted scholar at the Library of Korranberg, these words, translated from an ancient prophecy, foretell the course of recent events in the Eldeen Reaches, where an upstart warlord led a barbarian army from the Demon Wastes on a mission of plunder.
>>
>>For all your news needs, be they ageless riddles or breaking modern developments, keep reading the Korranberg Chronicle!
>>

Various immortal beings exert their will upon the people and nations of Eberron. Many are villainous forces that adventurers might find themselves resisting, such as the fiends of the Lords of Dust or the Quori and the Dreaming Dark. Even those without evil motives are often inscrutable—the agendas of immortal beings spanning millennia. What role you might play in an immortal's schemes and what sorts of deeds you'll be called on to perform varies from patron to patron. Consider the following options when determining what immortal patron your party might serve:

**Flamewind**. A gynosphinx with oracular powers came back to Morgrave University with a Xen'drik expedition two years ago, and took up residence there. In addition to her first-hand knowledge of Xen'drik, she is one of the few nondragons to have made extensive study of the Draconic Prophecy. She sometimes sends adventurers on missions by uttering a cryptic prophecy. "It is time for the Globe of Seven Lights to be brought out of Xen'drik," she might say. She never explains her proclamations, and never provides information on mundane affairs.

**Faerie Court**. Somewhere deep in the western forest of the Eldeen Reaches lies the Twilight Demesne, where powerful archfey hold court over an ongoing revelry. It often appears as if nothing more than mischief and caprice governs the actions of the archfey, but they have ancient interests in the mortal world—as well as extensive rivalries among themselves.

**Undying Court**. The honored, undead ancestors of Aerenal rule the elven nation and shape their people's destiny. These undead—known as deathless—despise evil undead, nurture an ancient grudge against dragons, and pursue the fulfillment of ancient prophecies.

## Inquisitive Agency
Your party works for an agency offering investigative services, or you might run your own firm as a group. Inquisitives put their keen minds and dogged determination to use unraveling mysteries. Inquisitive agencies run the gamut from private investigators to networks of detectives supported by dragonmarked houses.

### Finders Guild
Across Khorvaire, the inquisitives of House Tharashk have a reputation for discretion and cunning. Members of that house operate the Finders Guild, a loose collection of independent inquisitive agencies. Dragonmarked heirs of House Tharashk own and operate some of these agencies, but each employs unmarked inquisitives as well, leaving the heirs free to take on the most difficult cases. A connection with the Finders Guild is viewed as a mark of high quality, a guarantee that a particular agency numbers among the best in the business.

In the city of Sharn alone, four inquisitives with the Mark of Finding lead agencies in different parts of the city: Kurt Karr'Aashta's Investigations in the neighborhood of Deathsgate, Information Acquisition in Underlook, Thuranne Velderan's Investigative Services in Warden Towers, and Globe Information Agency in Dragon Towers. Your party might be associated with any of these groups, or you might operate your own affiliated agency. In any case, your connection to the Finders Guild means you have a sterling reputation to uphold.

>> ##### Aundairian Scroll—Genius Inquisitive serves cold justice
>>In yet another embarrassing blow to the Fairhaven Watch, renowned inquisitive "Feather" Fallester has apparently solved yet another case she randomly pulled from the watch's files of unsolved mysteries. The case—the theft of a bejeweled statuette on display in the University of Wynarn Museum of Antiquities—baffled watch officers seven years ago, but in a matter of five days, Fallester managed to pin the crime on a changeling thief called Spaut, who has confessed.
>>

***Allies.*** While the Finders' Guild's greatest strength is its internal connections, it lacks many strong allies beyond House Tharashk's holdings. That said, the following groups have had numerous interactions with the guild and generally view inquisitives in a positive light:

**Droaam**. Since the rise of the Daughters of Sora Kell in Droaam, members of House Tharashk have served as intermediaries between the realm of monsters and the east, bartering the services of monstrous mercenaries across Khorvaire. The house takes great pride in having forced mainstream Khorvaire to recognize that orcs and half-orcs are worthy of the same courtesies and opportunities as races long established in society, and house members are now using their status to do the same for various other races from Droaam. As a result, members of the Finders' Guild can expect at least a modicum of respect while traveling in Droaam

**Gatekeepers**. House Tharashk and the druidic sect of the Gatekeepers share common origins in the Shadow Marches, and the druids remain friendly with the house and its Finders' Guild. In the Marches, the guild often helps the druids locate stray aberrations and open portals between planes of existence. For their part, the Gatekeepers offer the support of their magic to aid guild members in whatever ways they can.

***Enemies.*** The work of inquisitives naturally creates enemies, mostly on a local scale: con artists, gangs, and others who have had their unsavory deeds uncovered. Such groups are inclined to hold grudges against the guild as a whole. The guild's enemies on a larger scale are few, but include the following groups.

**Daask**. The Finders Guild has a difficult relationship with the criminal organization called Daask. On the one hand, Daask is a violent criminal gang whose members are often targeted by Finders Guild inquisitives. On the other hand, Daask is a gang of monsters, many of whom actually left Droaam under the auspices of House Tharashk. Finders Guild inquisitives who pry too deeply into Daask business often feel pressure to back away coming from higher in House Tharashk. Those who ignore that pressure tend to end up the targets of Daask assassins.

**House Deneith**. For centuries, House Deneith cornered the market on mercenary forces in Khorvaire. It was an unpleasant surprise for them when House Tharashk entered the mercenary market in the later days of the war, bringing monsters from Droaam to bolster Five Nations armies. House Deneith still resents House Tharashk for this, and the animosity between the houses only increases when Finders' Guild inquisitives stick their noses into Sentinel Marshal business.

### Patron Benefits
With an inquisitive agency as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:

**Compensation**. You can collect fees from your clients when you undertake investigations on their behalf. You can set those fees, and clients will often pay higher fees as your reputation and prestige increase. A fee of 5 sp to 10 sp per inquisitive per day, plus expenses incurred as part of the investigation, is a reasonable starting rate.

**Contacts**. Through the Finders' Guild, each associated inquisitive agency can benefit from the knowledge and experience of not only other inquisitives, but also bounty hunters, explorers, dragonshard prospectors, and others who make use of House Tharashk's talent for finding. Thus, an affiliated agency might find helpful allies not only in cities throughout the Five Nations, but even in remote corners of the wilderness where trackers and prospectors ply their trade. At the DM's discretion, your contacts might direct you to new cases, offer you leads in the case you're working on, put you in touch with their own network of contacts, or show up suddenly to pull you out of the fire. You can call in a favor from your agency to draw on the resources of any of your contacts. At the start of the campaign, roll twice on the Contacts table to choose two contacts. You will certainly acquire new contacts in the course of your adventures, who might or might not fit the descriptions of contacts on this table.

##### Contacts
| d12 | Contact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A friendly law-enforcement officer sends clients your way and gives you inside information about the workings of the watch. |
| 2 | A satisfied former client with a minor position in local government can pull strings for you. |
| 3 | A lieutenant in a crime gang knows the underworld and will help you so long as you don't interfere in that gang's affairs. |
| 4 | A bitter, more experienced inquisitive spends a lot of time telling you who you could have talked to ten years ago—if that person hadn't died—but still knows a lot about the city's inner workings. |
| 5 | The owner of a tavern or other business that attracts clientele from the seedy parts of society has an ear to the ground and often feeds you leads to more work. |
| 6 | A wealthy former client can get you into high-society parties and put you in touch with other rich people. |
| 7 | A nosy journalist always wants to write stories about your cases, but also helps lead you to new work and key contacts. |
| 8 | A local priest appreciates the work you do and provides you with minor magical assistance. |
| 9 | A tough-as-nails street urchin will carry messages for you, lead you anywhere in the city, and squeeze into tight spaces for a meager reward. |
| 10 | A brooding warforged can connect you to an extensive network of former soldiers. |
| 11 | A kalashtar seer might be a fraud, but also occasionally provides you with valuable leads. |
| 12 | A curious changeling always seems to show up when you least expect it. |

### Build Your Group
A wide variety of talents can be useful in the work of an inquisitive, leading the Finders' Guild to employ specialists with diverse skill sets. Many inquisitives come from backgrounds such as criminal, sage, soldier, or urchin, regardless of the role they play in a group. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:

**Client**. When a routine investigation goes sideways, sometimes innocents get unwillingly caught in the action. The common artisan who hired the party to find her missing partner might find herself and her hired inquisitives on the run when things take a deadly turn. Such a Client is often a nonplayer character whose connection with the party is dissolved at the end of an adventure, but sometimes a Client develops a taste for excitement and becomes a fixture in the campaign. A perfectly ordinary background such as guild artisan or folk hero often work well with this character, who otherwise needs no specific proficiencies or capabilities.

**Consultant**. Sometimes skilled individuals end up working alongside inquisitives for a time. Such Consultants might work for a newspaper, study an esoteric field, or write crime fiction for a living. This character is usually similar to an Investigator, but typically has an unusual background or expert knowledge. The relationship between a Consultant and the rest of the party can be a source of drama—or comedy.

![[063-1-48.png|right|300]]

**Interrogator**. The Interrogator specializes in interaction with suspects, witnesses, or others who need persuasion to reveal what they know. A high Charisma combined with proficiency in both Persuasion and Intimidation prove helpful in this role. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers have both the requisite talents and the ability to supplement their interrogations with magic.

**Investigator**. Investigators piece evidence into a coherent whole that explains a mystery. This character combines a high Intelligence score with proficiency in skills such as Investigation, Perception, and sometimes Medicine. The Investigator might also use divination and other forms of magic to supplement those skills, making wizards a natural fit for this role.

**Tough**. An inquisitive's work is inherently dangerous, so it's often important for their group to include someone who can physically intervene when situations devolve into combat. The Tough's role might include fighting criminal thugs, kicking in doors, and even roughing up suspects, all of which suggests a high Strength score and combat ability. The Intimidation skill can also helpfully supplement the Tough's work.

### Types of Inquisitive Work
Much of the work done by inquisitives is relatively mundane: collecting evidence of marital infidelity, investigating insurance fraud, or finding runaways. Sometimes these relatively innocent investigations can lead into the shadowy underbelly of society and become more dangerous, but most adventurers prefer the more dangerous kinds of inquisitive work. Your group might specialize in one particular kind of work, or it might take whatever cases come its way. Roll or pick from the Investigative Expertise table to determine your agency's specialty.

##### Investigative Expertise
| d6 | Investigation |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Find People**. You seek people who are lost, in hiding, on the run, or victims of foul play. |
| 2 | **Find Items**. Whether it's a stolen painting or a family heirloom, you excel at finding lost items. |
| 3 | **Justice for All**. The powerful often escape justice due to their wealth and influence. Their victims sometimes turn to you, hoping you'll help set things right. |
| 4 | **Help Law Enforcement**. The city watch must obey the rules to bring criminals to justice. When the rules need to be bent or broken, they turn to you for help. |
| 5 | **Uncover Secrets**. You put your inquisitive skills to use inquiring into others' mysterious backgrounds. |
| 6 | **Private Security**. You provide services for a specific organization. Perhaps you travel on airships to provide security or work in a casino to catch cheaters. |

### Signature Case
Inquisitives occupy a significant place in the popular imagination, both in their real-life exploits (as reported in the newspapers) and in many fictionalized accounts. As romanticized heroes of many tales, they shed the light of truth into the shadows to uncover secret misdeeds. Equally romanticized as self-serving muckrakers, they often use questionable methods to bring to light secrets that might have better remained hidden, causing untold harm in the process.

Whether true or false, stories like these tend to cling to inquisitive agencies and color their reputations. What big story is associated with your agency (and possibly your party)? Are the stories accurate, or do they reflect only one side of a complicated situation? Roll on the Signature Case table or choose a case that cemented your reputation.

##### Signature Case
| d6 | Case |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Case of the Century.** You uncovered key evidence in a sensational case. You made headlines, but some parties involved carry grudges against you. |
| 2 | **The Set Up**. You uncovered evidence of a high-profile figure's misdeeds. At trial, that evidence was deemed false, but by then the accused's career was ruined. |
| 3 | **Scandal**. Your work uncovered a deeply embarrassing scandal that ended a powerful politician's career. |
| 4 | **Underdog Champion**. You brought justice to a sympathetic victim, proving yourself a champion of those overlooked by society. |
| 5 | **Genius**. You resolved a case that baffled others, and now you are celebrated for your brilliance. |
| 6 | **Bungler**. You bungled a case, badly. The guilty party walked free, and everyone blames you. |

### Clientele
Inquisitives tend to acquire a reputation for working with a certain type of person. Some are known for discretion, attracting wealthy clients who trust them to keep a secret. Others are known to have a soft spot for a sad story, drawing the type of client who has plenty of troubles but little money. Roll on or choose an option from the Clientele table to determine who tends to show up at your office with a case.

##### Clientele
| d6 | Clientele |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Wealthy Socialites**. Your discretion and low-key approach to cases make you the perfect team to handle cases best keep out of the public eye. |
| 2 | **Underdogs**. Whether deserved or not, you have a reputation for doing the right thing even if it comes without a reasonable fee. Anyone pitted against the rich and powerful knows to come to you for justice. |
| 3 | **Magnet for Trouble**. Maybe you trust people too easily or it's just bad luck, but every client who walks into your office has some double deal, hidden agenda, or scam they're running. |
| 4 | **Desperate**. You have a reputation for taking on clients who can't afford your services. Every hard-luck case ends up at your door, whether you want them or not. |
| 5 | **Warforged**. In a world where the rights of warforged are not always certain, you take up their cause. |
| 6 | **Criminals**. When a criminal has been wronged but doesn't want to be brought to justice they come to you, trusting (rightly or wrongly) that you won't turn them in. |

### Other Inquisitive Agencies
Beyond the Finders' Guild, the following inquisitive organizations solve mysteries across Khorvaire:

**King's Citadel**. Part spy, part inquisitive, and part soldier, the agents of the King's Citadel serve crown and country as the ultimate agency for dispensing the king's justice in Breland. Local watches and constabularies can call on its agents when a crime or situation poses a threat that spreads beyond their jurisdiction.

**Sentinel Marshals**. The Sentinel Marshals are a multinational force administered by House Deneith and authorized to enforce the law across Khorvaire. As the only force that can cross borders in pursuit of fugitives, they are well trained to track renegades.

**Sharn Watch**. Like most local police forces of any size, the Sharn Watch includes inquisitives devoted to solving crimes and tracking down the perpetrators.

**Warning Guild**. Affiliated with but largely independent from House Medani, the Warning Guild provides certification and contract employment for bodyguards, inquisitives, and sentries across Khorvaire. The guild emphasizes the use of logic, perception, and deduction to assemble fragments of evidence into a recognizable whole. Its inquisitives are often called upon to solve mysteries that baffle local law enforcement.

**Running Your Own**. Rather than join an existing inquisitive agency, you can start your own. You need to establish your own office. You can collect the same fees as if you worked for another agency, and you have access to the same range of contacts. You can also use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your agency, as described at the start of this section.

## Military Force
Your group serves as a team of soldiers in a larger military force, one dedicated to combat missions or other dangerous tasks. You could be a team of mercenaries, a special forces unit, or an ordinary squad of infantry. Perhaps you protect a nation's people from monsters, or even continue to fight the Last War in the shadows. There is plenty of work for military forces at the edges of civilization, such as protecting the Eldeen Reaches from the dangers of the Demon Marches or skirmishing with Droaam at the borders of Breland.

### Redcloak Battalion
The soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion number among the deadliest warriors in Breland. When a situation calls for extreme military force, law enforcers turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought at the forefront of the Last War, and Brelish bards still sing of the exploits of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the battalion was split up and its units assigned to cities and strongholds across Breland.

As an elite group of special forces, the Redcloaks don't include inexperienced adventurers in their ranks. Considering that, there are two ways to use the Redcloak Battalion as a group patron.

First, the Redcloaks do sometimes take inexperienced adventurers under their wings. Existing Redcloaks proved themselves on the battlefields of the Last War; if the group is to continue, the Redcloaks of the future have to learn the soldier's trade in different battles. To such ends, senior members of the battalion send your party on missions across Khorvaire to provide you with combat experience as well as to further Redcloak goals.

Alternatively, your DM might decide to start the campaign with your characters at a higher level and already established as members of the Redcloaks (see "*Starting at Higher Level*" in chapter 1 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). In this case, you might also begin with magic items and other gear reflecting your status in the organization. The standard-issue uniform for the Redcloaks is a hooded crimson *cloak of protection* bearing two badges: the seal of the Brelish crown on the left shoulder and a snarling displacer beast surrounded by the words, "First in battle, last to fall"—the Redcloak insignia and motto—on the right.

***Allies.*** As part of Breland's military forces, the Redcloaks can count on the support of the crown, the King's Citadel, and the larger Brelish army, largely summarized as the following parties:

![[064-1-49.png|right|300]]

**King Boranel**. The king of Breland is a cautious advocate of the Redcloaks. He values their contributions but fears their power, which is why he divided the battalion after the end of the war. Still, he rewards loyalty among the Redcloaks by showing loyalty to them in return. Again and again, he has proven himself willing to exercise his power on behalf of a loyal Redcloak.

**Other Redcloaks**. The first place any Redcloak turns for help is another Redcloak. No one else is as reliable and competent, while being unerringly faithful to the Brelish king and the battalion. Every Redcloak readily provides aid to other members, with no questions asked and no favor expected in return.

***Enemies.*** As veterans of the Last War, many Redcloaks carry strong grudges against other nations. They tend to believe that the Treaty of Thronehold is merely an intermission in the ongoing conflict, and soon enough King Boranel will take his proper place on the throne of a reunited Galifar. Many of these grudges are personal based on an individual soldier's experience in the war, but some of them run both ways. Among the Redcloaks, tensions still run hot regarding their former rivals, particularly those from the following nations:

**Darguun**. The hobgoblins of Darguun fought alongside Brelish forces at the Battle of Cairn Hill, but the cordial relations between the two nations frayed immediately after. The Redcloaks skirmished with hobgoblins who were leading Thrane civilians in chains back to Darguun. Few Darguuls remember the skirmish itself, but the "wicked red-cloaked Brelish" have an established place in the goblinoids' collective memory—and many Redcloaks do remember the event bitterly.

**Thrane**. In the waning years of the Last War, the Redcloaks played a major role in the devastating Battle of Cairn Hill between Brelish and Thrane forces. Thanks to heavy losses on both sides, veterans of that battle tend to nurse bitter grudges against their enemies.

### Patron Benefits
With a military force as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:

**Accommodations**. You can always find a place to stay and meals on a base or fort connected to your military force. Your accommodations are appropriate to your rank and station, but never luxurious.

>> ##### Newthrone Ledger—Thirteen dead in Blackscale Slaughter!
>>Venturing unusually far from their accustomed territory in the eastern jungles, a band of enormous lizardfolk—described by local experts as members of the Blackscale Tribe—broke through the fortifications at Adderport and killed thirteen residents before retreating back into the jungles. Khalar d'Tharashk has announced a plan to track the perpetrators and exact retribution under the sponsorship of King Sebastes.
>>

**Armory**. You can purchase nonmagical weapons and armor at a 20 percent discount at a facility associated with your military force. This might also be a location where you can buy magic items, at the DM's discretion, but you receive no discount.

**Chain of Command**. You are part of a rigid chain of command. In addition to providing you with orders, this structure reduces your responsibility for your own actions. If you land in trouble in your own nation, you answer to your officers, not local law enforcement.

**Orders**. You undertake your missions at the direction of a commanding officer. Your absolute obedience is expected. These missions are often explicit, leading you into the path of adventure. In some cases, though, you might be trusted with more open-ended tasks that afford you more leeway in interpreting orders.

**Salary**. Each member of your group is paid a regular salary. The amount varies depending on your organization and your position within it, but at minimum you enjoy a modest lifestyle. You might receive a small salary (as little as 1 sp per day) but also receive food and housing on a military base. Or you could receive 1 gp per day but rely on that money for room and board. With higher rank comes commensurately higher pay. As an officer, you can maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

### Build Your Group
A military unit, like most adventuring parties, incorporates a range of useful skills while covering each member's weaknesses with another's strengths. Thus, characters of any class can find a home in such a unit, and a diversity of different skills and backgrounds benefits the group as a whole. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:

**Commander**. Every band of infantry has its leader, even if that person isn't a officer. The Commander earns that position through some combination of high Charisma and Intelligence—the ability to inspire and the capacity to plan. Proficiency in skills such as Persuasion and History can be helpful as well. The Commander might be a career soldier (with that background) or someone from a noble background placed in command by virtue of birth. A Commander might be a fighter, bard, cleric, paladin, or even wizard—as magic proves valuable in military engagements.

**Medic**. Keeping soldiers alive is essential to military success, and that's the Medic's job. In an elite unit of adventurers, the Medic is often a cleric or has another class with healing ability, but these characters are also often proficient in the Medicine skill or use of a *herbalism kit*. A Medic can be a soldier who demonstrated aptitude in healing and got moved into this position, or a character from a different background (such as acolyte, sage, or even hermit) who decided to put medical expertise to military use.

**Scout**. Trained in navigating the wilderness and laying ambushes for enemy soldiers, the Scout melds the combat skill of a fighter with the skills of a ranger or rogue. High Dexterity and Wisdom scores, combined with proficiency in the Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival skills, support this character's core capabilities. Scouts are often recruited from people who are more familiar with the wilds than with city streets, including folk heroes, hermits, and outlanders.

**Soldier**. Soldiers make up the core of most military groups, whether they're general infantry, magical artillery, or elite special forces. These characters come from all classes and backgrounds—for some, their background before joining the military is more important than their current role. No particular set of talents is common to all soldiers, but military units often strive to avoid duplication of skills.

**Warforged**. Literally made for war, most warforged characters have spent the years since the end of the Last War trying to find a new way of life. For some warforged, the answer is to continue fighting the war one way or another, often as part of an organized military unit. This experience, as a people created to fulfill a role and now seemingly locked into a destructive destiny, is just a part of life for many warforged.

### Military Missions
The work involved in serving as a military unit is wide-ranging. Your missions potentially run the risk of shattering the fragile peace established by the Treaty of Thronehold and plunging all of Khorvaire back into war. Alternatively, you might consider running your campaign during the Last War, so your group's missions influence the war effort and don't risk violating the treaty. As a group, consider the options on the Military Missions table and work with your DM to decide how the work you do fits into the larger picture of war and peace in Khorvaire.

##### Military Missions
| d6 | Missions |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Strike Force**. You are trained to make quick, strategic, devastating attacks against enemy assets. |
| 2 | **Special Forces**. You're trained in covert operations, similar to the work of spies but with more focus on combat. |
| 3 | **Defensive Operations**. Your focus is on protecting your allies from attackers, monsters, or deadlier enemies. |
| 4 | **Reconnaissance**. Your missions involve keeping track of enemy troops and surveying potential battlefields. |
| 5 | **Peacekeeping**. Your paradoxical task is to maintain the fragile peace of the Treaty of Thronehold by maintaining a military presence in turbulent areas. |
| 6 | **Warforged Affairs**. You are responsible for hunting down berserk warforged, working in the gray spaces between national order and a people seeking their destiny. |

### Defining Mission
You were there at a crucial moment that turned the tide of the Last War. Choose or roll an option on the Defining Mission table to determine what that moment was.

##### Defining Mission
| d6 | Mission |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Heroic Stand**. You knew if you took one step back from the line, all would be lost. When relief arrived days later, you had not budged. |
| 2 | **Telling Blow**. The enemy general never knew what hit them. You still carry their personal flag as a trophy. |
| 3 | **Dawn Raid**. You traveled hundreds of miles around enemy lines to reach your target. In a single day, months of enemy preparation went up in flames. |
| 4 | **Break the Line**. During a key battle, you were part of a heroic push to break the enemy line. |
| 5 | **Liberator**. You were at the forefront of a daring assault to liberate a captured citadel or town. |
| 6 | **Sharp Eye**. The enemy's secret attack would've been devastating. Luckily, you spotted it in time. |

### Nemesis
During the Last War, you had a run-in with a particularly dangerous foe, one who still haunts your nightmares. One day you'll have your revenge. Consult the Nemesis table to determine the identity of your foe.

##### Nemesis
| d6 | Nemesis |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Necromancer**. You lost a lot of friends in battle, but what made it worse was watching that cackling wizard raise them as zombies and turn them against you. |
| 2 | **Camp Commandant**. As prisoners of war, you were captured and subjected to brutal conditions in a prisoner camp. The commandant delighted in your pain. |
| 3 | **Inept Commander**. Your friends would still be alive if one incompetent officer with political power and influential allies hadn't sent you on a disastrous mission. |
| 4 | **Colossus**. You were among those who survived an encounter with a warforged colossus. Cyre or House Cannith—whoever was responsible for such a nightmare—deserves whatever evil fate comes their way. |
| 5 | **Mercenaries**. A band of traitorous mercenaries who switched sides, turning the battle against you. |
| 6 | **Champion**. One mighty hero fought on the enemy side, wielding powerful magic and cruel strategies against the rank-and-file soldiers on your side. |

### Military Contacts
Your group's primary contact within your hierarchy is generally your superior officer—the person who gives you orders and is responsible for your success or failure. The Commanding Officer table offers suggestions for the personality and goals of that officer.

##### Commanding Officer
| d8 | Officer |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An angry officer who yells every order, reprimands you for even the smallest mistake, and fully expects you to fail at every mission you undertake |
| 2 | A battle-scarred officer who experienced terrible horrors during the Last War and is barely capable of giving you orders through a haze of intoxication |
| 3 | A grim officer who expects the Last War to reignite at any moment and intends to be ready |
| 4 | A cheerful officer with a dark sense of humor who merrily sends you into grave danger |
| 5 | A kindly officer who is hesitant to send you into danger and constantly reminds you to be careful |
| 6 | A bitter officer who carries deep grudges against your nation's enemies in the Last War and leaps at any chance to deal them any blow |
| 7 | An optimistic officer who believes that a new era of peace is just over the horizon, as soon as these few last military tasks are complete |
| 8 | A devout officer who believes that your success or failure lies entirely in divine hands and you're ultimately just along for the ride |

### Other Military Forces
Every nation in Khorvaire has its military forces. In addition to the Redcloak Battalion, the following groups number among the forces most likely to make use of a team of adventurers:

**Blademarks Guild**. House Deneith manages mercenary activities across Khorvaire through its Blademarks Guild, with house members serving as officers, trainers, and strategists. The rank-and-file soldiers of the guild are largely human mercenaries but also includes significant numbers of hobgoblins from Darguun, elves from Valenar, and Cyran soldiers who no longer have a nation to fight for.

**Maruk Ghaash'kala**. Among the orc tribes of the Demon Wastes, the Maruk tribe inhabits the deadly Labyrinth that lies between the wastes and the Eldeen Reaches. In its sacred dedication to containing the threat of the Lords of Dust, it draws significant numbers of orc barbarians from the Shadow Marches, human scouts from the Eldeen Reaches, and even youths from the Carrion Tribes that live deeper in the wastes.

**Q'barra**. The frontier nation of Q'barra has significant need for military forces to protect its communities from the lizardfolk, warbands from Valenar, Lhazaar marauders, and other dangers of the jungle.

**Valenar**. The elves of Valenar have no interest in peace, but they participated in the talks that led to the Treaty of Thronehold to gauge the measure of their enemies and gain acceptance in the human courts. Today, Valenar forces continue to raid the Talenta Plains and Q'barra on a regular basis, in stark defiance of the Treaty of Thronehold. A Valenar warband is unlikely to contain members of races other than elves and perhaps half-elves, but such a band could make an interesting military party.

***Running Your Own.*** Rather than join an existing force, you might choose to form your own mercenary outfit. You can assemble a unit of 3d10 soldiers housed in a headquarters with an armory, barracks, and private quarters for you and any other officers. Your group earns 3d20 gp per month, plus enough money to maintain your headquarters. You might be able to acquire weapons and armor through an arms dealer at a 20 percent discount, at the DM's discretion. You give the orders to those beneath you and take orders from no one, but that means that you are ultimately responsible for the activities of everyone in your outfit.

You can use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your unit and potentially increase your earnings, as described at the start of this section.

## Newspaper
Your group comprises a team of ace reporters working for a chronicle—one of the many newspapers that provide news and entertainment for readers across Khorvaire. You might be under contract to provide the paper with tales of your exploits as you search out adventure. Or you might be investigative reporters dedicated to shining the light of truth into the darkness of criminal, political, and religious corruption. You might have an unflinching commitment to the truth, or be more interested in selling papers—or you might be in conflict with the chronicle's management over priorities.

The simplest chronicles appear as scrolls nailed to public message boards containing the pertinent news of the week. More ambitious chronicles—including the *Aundairian Scroll*, the *Breland Ledger*, and the *Sharn Inquisitive*—are presented as folded broadsheets nested together to form simple books.

### Korranberg Chronicle
By far Khorvaire's best known and most widely read newspaper is the *Korranberg Chronicle*. Thanks to its unflinching and mostly unbiased coverage of the Last War, combined with a distribution deal with House Orien, the *Korranberg Chronicle* enjoys a loyal and avid readership throughout central Khorvaire. The *Chronicle* is released three times a week (on Mol, Wir, and Far), and each edition features some mixture of news from around Khorvaire, stories of adventurers and exciting expeditions, business solicitations, royal proclamations, and almanac information.

***Offices.*** The *Chronicle*'s main offices are located in Korranberg. The paper also maintains field offices in the Five Nations, the Mror Holds, and Zilargo. Each field office shares space with a House Sivis message station, giving reporters at the office the ready ability to communicate with the home office (at discounted rates).

***Employees.*** The *Chronicle* sends reporters across Khorvaire. Most of them live in Korranberg or near one of the field offices, but correspondents might be stationed in more remote regions for long periods of time, and the paper frequently publishes stories written by freelancers from across the world. Your adventuring party most likely falls into that last category, at least at the start of your career.

A large staff of editors—mostly but not exclusively comprised of Zil gnomes—works out of the newspaper's various offices. They are organized into an extensive hierarchy from senior to junior editors. The top tier of senior editors is responsible for broad categories of stories, such as crime or international affairs. Lower tiers take on increasingly specific subsets of that category, down to the junior editor responsible for the crime beat in Sharn's Lower Dura district.

Even the most senior editors, though, are responsible to the top tier of the *Chronicle*'s management, including its publisher and its secretive board of owners.

***Allies.*** The *Korranberg Chronicle* is widely known and respected as a source of balanced news coverage. As such, it has friends in many places, including some in positions of power. Some of the *Chronicle*'s closest allies come from the following groups:

**House Orien**. House Orien distributes the *Chronicle* along its mail and lightning rail runs across Khorvaire, helping the newspaper reach a huge audience. Employees of the *Chronicle* can travel on lightning rail coaches at a discounted rate of 15 cp/mile (instead of the usual 2 sp/mile).

**House Sivis**. The newspaper also cooperates closely with House Sivis to facilitate communication between the main office and the field offices, as well as between reporters and their editors. The house bills the *Chronicle* directly for communications using *speaking stones* or *sending* spells directed to the newspaper's main office.

**Zilargo**. The gnome nation of Zilargo is generally friendly to the newspaper. The senior editors, publisher, and owners of the *Chronicle* are influential people in the city of Korranberg and Zilargo as a whole. In extreme circumstances Zilargo officials might be persuaded to advocate for the newspaper's employees.

***Enemies.*** The *Korranberg Chronicle* is dedicated to learning and reporting the truth, and such an attitude is always certain to arouse the ire of those who would rather keep their secrets hidden. The following represents just a fraction of the enemies the newspaper has made over the years:

**The Boromar Clan**. The dominant crime syndicate in Sharn is still stinging from an exposé published ten years ago that resulted in the arrest of many of the clan's leaders and gave other gangs a foothold in the city. Members of the Boromar Clan go to great lengths—even murder—to sabotage *Chronicle* reporters who pry into their secrets.

**Karrnath**. King Kaius nurses a grudge against the newspaper stemming from its coverage of the peace process at the end of the war, blaming them for several setbacks along the way to the eventual signing of the Treaty of Thronehold. *Chronicle* reporters operating in Karrnath often face harassment and find bureaucracy impeding their every effort.

**House Thuranni**. The snoops and spies of the *Chronicle* have pried one time too many into House Thuranni's private affairs. No member or agent of the house will cooperate with *Chronicle* reporters under any circumstances.

### Patron Benefits
With a newspaper as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:

**Compensation**. Assuming that you regularly provide the newspaper with stories it can print, each member of your group earns 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle.

**Expenses**. In addition to your salary, your group can be reimbursed for expenses related to your work. The newspaper covers the cost of travel when it's required for your stories, food when you perform an interview over a meal, communication costs using courier services or message stations, and similar work-related expenses. If your expenses are excessive, your patron might refuse to repay them.

**Equipment**. Your group can request access to equipment owned by the newspaper, such as a printing press. With permission, you can use this equipment for your private purposes, within reason.

**Press Access**. Each member of your group is issued identification papers from the nation where the newspaper is based. These papers establish your identity and identify you as a member of the press, which commands a certain amount of respect. You can often secure an audience with those you want to talk to. Of course, this isn't a guarantee of safety—if you discover a damaging truth, some people will do whatever it takes to make sure it never sees print.

### Build Your Group
Newspapers employ a wide range of adventurers to bring news back to the home office. Consider some or all of these roles for the characters in your party:

>> ##### Voice of Breland—Korranberg Chronicle Exposed!
>>Who really pulls the strings behind the ostensibly unbiased news coverage of the *Korranberg Chronicle*? The Chronicle's publisher, a wily Zil gnome named Cassia Lorridan Claddik, is the most public face of its leadership, and her connection to Korranberg's ruling Council of Nine is well known. But she is not the ultimate authority determining what gets printed and what does not. No, that honor goes to the shadowy board of the *Chronicle*'s owners.
>>
>>*Voice* reporters have uncovered the names and positions of several members of this board, and the results are nothing less than shocking. The Trust—the shadowy secret police who maintain order in Zilargo—is well represented on this board, raising questions about the extent to which the *Chronicle* is a propaganda engine for Zilargo. Worse still, several of the wealthiest and most influential members of the board are associated with the Aurum, a shadowy cabal whose primary interest seems to be increasing its members' wealth and influence. Whose interest, then, does the *Chronicle* serve?
>>
>>All the more reason, loyal readers, to rely on the *Voice of Breland* for unbiased news you can use.
>>

**Civilian**. Some groups include members whose skills are great for reporting but less useful on adventures. This could be the designated writer, a political cartoonist, or a chronicler who records the party's adventures. This might be a challenging role for a player character to fill, but an NPC could provide services to the party, making them worth keeping around.

**Face**. Typically gifted with a high Charisma score and skilled in a combination of Persuasion, Intimidation, and Insight, the Face takes the lead in conducting interviews or talking the group's way past obstacles. A character with access to enchantment magic (such as a bard or sorcerer) can supplement natural Charisma with magical persuasion. A character with the charlatan background, proficiency in Deception, or proficiency with a Disguise kit might also fill this role.

**Muscle**. Sometimes sources need a bit of physical cajoling to share their stories. The Muscle has a knack for getting people to talk. Alternatively, when those in power lock away the truth, the Muscle physically wrestles it free. Any character who's proficient with armor and martial weapons (such as a fighter) makes a fine choice for this role. Characters in this role are often former soldiers or more-or-less reformed criminals.

**Networker**. The Networker knows exactly who can get the party what they need. This character makes extensive use of contacts and friends to facilitate the party's work. A character with the criminal background likely has underworld contacts, while an urchin could be familiar with the ins and outs of the city. Interpersonal connections are typically more important than any particular skills or abilities for this character, although many Networkers have high Charisma scores.

**Snoop**. A Snoop pries into secrets and pieces together the clues behind a sensational story. High Intelligence and proficiency in Investigation often aids the core work of the Snoop, and knowledge of Arcana, History, or Religion can be helpful for background research. Divination magic can also prove useful (perhaps in the hands of a wizard or a cleric), while a character with the sage background might have a knack for research.

### Types of Reporting
Decide as a group, in consultation with your DM, what kind of reporting you do for the newspaper. It's possible that different members of your group have different specialties, or that only some members actually write stories while the rest aid the reporters. Choose an option or roll on the Journalistic Focus table to determine what sort of reporting you specialize in.

##### Journalistic Focus
| d10 | Reporting |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Investigation**. Your job is to uncover the secrets that governments, dragonmarked houses, and other powerful people don't want the public to know. |
| 2 | **Muckraking**. You look for scandalous and titillating secrets that famous people would rather hide. |
| 3 | **Local News**. You care about the local community and report on local events and government. |
| 4 | **International Affairs**. You report on the activities of national governments and their relationships. |
| 5 | **Crime**. You work with police and inquisitives—or do some inquisitive work yourselves—to report on criminal activity. |
| 6 | **Cultural Reporting**. You write about arts, fashion, and similar events and trends. |
| 7 | **Science and Magic**. Your job is to investigate scientific and magical advances and explain them in jargon-free language anyone can understand. |
| 8 | **Personal Interest**. You seek out stories of personal triumph over adversity, such as how people are rebuilding and working together in the wake of the Last War. |
| 9 | **Travel**. You travel extensively and write about the best way for others to enjoy such journeys. |
| 10 | **Adventure Logs**. Your job is to entertain the public with exciting stories about your life as an adventurer. |

### Famous Story
Is there one story that hangs over your group's head, for good or ill? Maybe it sets a high bar you might never reach again, or ensures you'll never write a story of a different kind. Consult the Famous Story table to determine what reporting has most colored your career.

##### Famous Story
| d6 | Famous Story |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Fear Monger**. You spiced up a story by stretching a few facts, instigating a wave of misinformation that plagues public discourse to this day. |
| 2 | **Hit Piece**. You have revealed secrets that many famous people wanted kept under wraps. You try to keep a low profile when dealing with the rich and powerful. |
| 3 | **Unheeded Warning**. You've been tracking a significant story and have published damning articles. Unfortunately, those who keep the truth hidden work to make even your most ironclad proof look shaky. |
| 4 | **Scandal**. You reported on a massive scandal that completely upended the local political scene. |
| 5 | **Buried Headline**. You almost broke a story, but then received a threat or bribe so significant that you put it on ice. |
| 6 | **Double Cross**. You thought you had the scoop of a lifetime, but you were fed false information and published a story that was pure fiction. |

### Reporting Repercussions
Your reporting changes lives—you like to think for the better. Sometimes, though, your work has drawn some fairly pointed criticism and earned you an enemy. Reference the Story Aftermath table to determine the repercussions of one of your most impactful stories.

##### Story Aftermath
| d6 | Aftermath |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Business**. Your reporting put a serious dent in a business, and that organization refuses to deal with you. |
| 2 | **Dragonmarked House**. One of the dragonmarked houses has sworn revenge against you. You avoid showing your face in their facilities. |
| 3 | **Criminal**. You exposed a criminal conspiracy. Most involved were arrested, but a few crooks remain free. |
| 4 | **Politician**. You ended a politician's career, and they've sworn to return the favor. |
| 5 | **Rival Newspaper**. You got the scoop of a lifetime by stealing it from another newspaper. Now that paper tries to undermine you at every turn. |
| 6 | **Innocent Victim**. You rashly published the name of a person you incorrectly thought was connected to a scandal, ruining their life. |

### Newspaper Contacts
Usually, your primary contact—the person who gives you assignments for the newspaper—is an editor of some kind, who takes the stories you write and makes them suitable for the printed page. Depending on the editor, you might not even recognize the stories when they're printed, and your editor's personality and goals can have a tremendous impact on your work for the paper. Consult the Newspaper Contact table to learn about the editor or other newspaper figure you're responsible to.

##### Newspaper Contact
| d8 | Primary Contact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A tough-as-nails senior editor who holds you to high standards but rewards you well when you reach them |
| 2 | A wealthy newspaper owner who demands the paper use your work even though the editor doesn't want to |
| 3 | An ambitious junior editor who hopes that your work will help them rise through the ranks |
| 4 | A senior reporter obsessed with their own supposedly groundbreaking work, making you run down the day-to-day stories they don't consider "real journalism." |
| 5 | An editor who is more interested in keeping powerful friends happy than in reporting the truth |
| 6 | An editor who thinks the way to make reporters do their best work is by making them compete with each other, setting your group up against a team of rivals |
| 7 | An editor who suffered horrors during the Last War and is desperate for signs of hope |
| 8 | A cynical editor who seeks the corruption and down side in every story |

### Other Newspapers
Besides the well-respected *Korranberg Chronicle*, other newspapers in Khorvaire can be grouped into a few different categories:

>> ##### The Korranberg Chronicle Special Sul Edition—WAR IS OVER!
>>Treaty of Thronehold signed. Galifar is no more.
>>

**Local Rags**. Small papers such as the *Vathirond Journal*, the *Vedykar Sentinel*, and the *Write of Passage* are limited in circulation to their own home city, and their coverage is similarly limited in perspective.

**Mainstream Media**. The *Breland Ledger*, the *Sharn Inquisitive*, the *Aundairian Scroll*, and papers like them present generally balanced coverage of world events. They are usually a little slanted in favor of their home nations.

**Propaganda**. Some newspapers, such as the *Voice of Breland* and similar papers in other nations, print fiercely partisan news that seems designed to fan the flames of resentment that linger after the Last War.

***Running Your Own.*** Rather than work for an existing outlet, you can run your own newspaper. You own a small office and a printing press, and keep 2d4 employees to manage daily tasks and keep the paper going to press. You gain the benefit of press access as described earlier. Additionally, you can use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your paper in hopes of increasing your earnings, as described at the start of this section.

## Religious Order
Your group acts in the service of one of Khorvaire's most prominent or obscure religious institutions. Perhaps you're a team of devotees pursuing a cause for your faith, or maybe you're a bunch of cynics taking advantage of a wealthy congregation. You could be on a mission to retrieve sacred relics lost in ancient ruins, holy objects from war-ravaged temples, or treasures to fill the church's coffers. Your faith might drive you to hunt evil monsters or stave off interplanar invasions, to protect and defend the powerless from oppression and exploitation, or to spread the teachings of your religion in a land that's hostile to it. Or you could serve a corrupt hierarchy by making its enemies quietly disappear—though even the most cynical mercenaries might become true believers when confronted with the miraculous.

The patronage of a religious order isn't simply a matter of each member of your group belonging to the same faith. An actual organization—with its own resources, goals, and leaders—sponsors and directs your adventures.

### Templars of the Silver Flame
The Church of the Silver Flame includes three orders of clergy: ministers who tend congregations, friars who spread the faith, and templars who fight evil in the flesh. Your group has been ordained as templars and sent into war against the forces of evil.

As templars of the Silver Flame, you have distinctive silver tabards to wear over your other clothing or armor. You also have the privilege of using a knightly honorific before your name (typically "sir" or "lady"), and you are immediately recognized as a knight, an agent of the church, and effectively a lesser member of Thrane's aristocracy. This status guarantees the good will of members of the church and citizens of Thrane, but carries less weight and might even provoke animosity outside Thrane.

***Hierarchy.*** The order of the Templars of the Silver Flame is represented on the Council of Cardinals that serves as the governing body of Thrane and the church. Seven commanders govern the knights of the order under the Grand Master's leadership: one for each of the Five Nations of old, one for foreign lands, and one for the seas. Their assistants carry the title of marshal, but no real division of rank exists beneath them.

![[066-1-51.png|right|300]]

Knights templar are free to wander the world in pursuit of the order's aims. When leaving the jurisdiction of one commander and entering that of another, it is a knight's responsibility to promptly report to the commander of the new area, in case that commander has a pressing need for a knight to perform a mission. The commanders try to keep each other informed about where knights are operating and what they are doing, but this system works better in some places—and between some commanders—than others.

***Allies.*** The other two orders of the Church of the Silver Flame's clergy—ministers and friars—staunchly support the knights templar. Even when there is rivalry among the leaders of these orders and other officials of the church, the rank and file members support each other regardless of order. You can count on these clergy to help you secure spellcasting services, and to offer you other material aid within reason.

***Enemies.*** Since the order of knights templar is sworn to exterminate supernatural evil, such creatures are always hostile when they recognize a knight templar. The following groups and creatures viciously oppose the templars of the Silver Flame:

**Fiends and Undead**. Unnatural beings loathe templars, as they represent everything these foul creatures despise—light, life, hope, and good. These menaces sometimes go to great lengths to trap and destroy templars, and fiends take particular pleasure in corrupting the faithful to evil.

**Lycanthropes**. All types and alignments of lycanthropes have a particular hatred for the Church of the Silver Flame, thanks to the crusade that nearly exterminated their kind over a century ago. Shifters are uncomfortable with the templars for the same reason.

**The Order of the Emerald Claw.** Tied as it is to the Blood of Vol and the worship of the undead, the Order of the Emerald Claw opposes the Church of the Silver Flame and its agents in the world.

### Patron Benefits
With a religious order as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:

**Divine Service**. In times of need, your group can appeal to the priests of your faith for magical aid. A cleric or druid of your faith who is of sufficiently high level will cast any spell of up to 5th level on your group's behalf, without charge. The priest even provides any costly material components needed for the spell, so long as you can demonstrate your need and are in good standing with the church.

**Equipment**. Each member of your party has a holy symbol or druidic focus, even if it isn't needed for spellcasting. Each of you also has a book containing prayers, rites, and scriptures of your faith.

**Proficiencies**. Each member of your party gains proficiency in the Religion skill, if the character doesn't already have it.

### Build Your Group
Religious orders attract people from all walks of life. It can be fun to play against type—to make a devout character with the criminal or charlatan background, for example. Regardless of your origins, consider the following roles for the characters in your party:

>> ##### The Voice of Thrane—Silver Flame's Crisis of Faith!
>>The Templars of the Silver Flame are supposed to represent the Church and the nation in pursuit of the highest ideals of the faith, as they crusade against the forces of evil across Khorvaire. But are they fulfilling that high calling? Or are they just as mired in politics as the Brelish bureaucracy?
>>
>>High Cardinal Baerdren ir'Davik, who also holds the rank of grand master of the templars, appears to be an exemplary templar, utterly dedicated to the mission of the order. Yet it is widely known that he chafes at the political and bureaucratic responsibilities that his position on the Council of Cardinals demands of him. This reporter has learned that Sir Baerdren would readily surrender his position, were it not for his distrust of his seneschal, Ofejjaia of Korth.
>>
>>Lady Ofejjaia, it seems, has other issues on her personal agenda besides advancing the cause of the knights templar, and one wonders if those issues are tied to her Karrnathi origin. Though her wisdom and sound judgment are not in dispute, it seems that Sir Baerdren fears that she would drive the order into obsolescence or even banishment if she were in charge.
>>
>>Does Lady Ofejjaia hold her lofty position because of her loyalty, her piety, and her qualifications? Or is she there simply so that Sir Baerdren can keep his eye on her and ensure that she doesn't sabotage the templars from within?
>>

**Fixer**. The Fixer might work for a religious order for entirely non-religious reasons. This character does the order's dirty work and clears away its problems. It's entirely possible for an entire party to be made up of Fixers, but rogues and fighters are especially well suited to this kind of work. Characters with the criminal background excel at putting their skills and contacts to use on the church's behalf.

**Prophet**. The Prophet is a visionary with a more-or-less direct connection to the divine. This character might be the driving force behind the group's quests, steering them according to divine will. Proficiency in skills such as Insight and Religion can help reflect this character's divine connection. The Prophet is often a cleric or druid, but could also be an NPC with no real adventuring skills, who needs the group's protection.

**Scholar**. The Scholar brings academic knowledge to bear in the religious order's work, often in the form of proficiency in History and Religion. This character might be an expert on ancient ruins or know all the weaknesses of the demons they are hunting. Characters with access to divination magic (including clerics with the Knowledge domains as well as wizards) might excel at this role. Many Scholars come from the sage background. Unlike the Prophet and Zealot, the Scholar isn't necessarily devout, just knowledgeable.

**Teacher**. Those in this role spread the teachings of the faith. This isn't usually an effort to win converts—though it can be, especially in the case of the Church of the Silver Flame—but rather the task of encouraging people to live according to the highest ideals of faith. Proficiency in skills such as Persuasion (or sometimes Intimidation) and Religion can be useful for this character. Many clerics fill this role, but devout bards can also be effective Teachers. Some Teachers bring skills from the entertainer background into the service of their faith.

**Zealot**. Dedicated to smiting the foes of the faith, the Zealot focuses on combat above all. Clerics, druids, and paladins make iconic Zealots, but any character can play this role; there are barbarians whose fury is fueled by their devotion, and rangers sworn to track down the enemies of the faith. The soldier and folk hero backgrounds are well suited to such champions of the faith.

### Serving the Order
What is the nature of your work for the religious order? As a group, consult the Religious Service table and work with your DM to decide what role you play—which likely shapes the kind of adventures you undertake.

##### Religious Service
| d6 | Service |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Smite Evil**. You battle evil in your order's name. |
| 2 | **Fight for Freedom**. You protect the downtrodden from the forces of oppression. |
| 3 | **Retrieval**. Your group seeks sacred relics and holy artifacts on behalf of your church. |
| 4 | **Root Out Corruption**. You are charged with finding corruption within the hierarchy of your own faith. |
| 5 | **Exhortation**. You work with the faithful at a grassroots level to get them to uphold their high ideals. |
| 6 | **Dirty Work**. As the radical zealots of your order, you sin so the other members of the order don't have to. |

### Hierarchy
Some religious orders are viewed with suspicion by the priestly hierarchies of their faiths; others are viewed as champions who act as the gods' hands in the world. Within a religious order, some members are highly respected while others are seen as dangerous for one reason or another. What is your relationship to the hierarchy you're a part of? Is your entire order held in particularly high or low esteem? Or does your adventuring party stand out from the larger order for some reason? Is your behavior in line with the expectations of your religion, or is it unorthodox in some way? Reference the Order Reputation table to determine how you're viewed by your larger religious institution.

##### Order Reputation
| d6 | Reputation |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Faithful Few**. You are seen as righteous crusaders, upholding the highest ideals of your faith and doing the gods' work in the world. Your deeds and methods are rarely, if ever, questioned. |
| 2 | **Respectable**. Your behavior and beliefs are in line with the hierarchy's expectations. As long as you stay in line, no one gives you trouble. |
| 3 | **Troublemakers**. You attract unwanted attention to your order or hierarchy from outside, so you are under a great deal of pressure to keep a low profile. |
| 4 | **Rebels**. You flout the dictates of your hierarchy—even if it's for just reasons. Your superiors constantly try to rein you in. |
| 5 | **Reformers**. You bring a much-needed breath of fresh air into the ranks of your faith. If only more people of faith would act as you do! |
| 6 | **Anathema**. For right or wrong, your behavior and beliefs are viewed as unacceptable, and the hierarchy of your faith actively opposes your work. |

### Religious Order Contacts
Your primary contact within the religious order is usually some kind of priest—not necessarily a cleric or druid, but someone who holds a priestly office and a position of some authority in the hierarchy of the organization. This person might direct you and your adventures according to their interpretation of divine will, or they might trust the gods to lead you to do what needs to be done. Of course, some priests (as well as lay functionaries) are more interested in their own agendas than any supposed divine will. Consult the Order Contact table to determine your liaison within the religious order.

##### Order Contact
| d8 | Contact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A cloistered priest with little worldly experience who doesn't really understand what you do but seems to approve of it anyway |
| 2 | A cynical priest who thinks nothing you do makes any difference in the grand scheme of things |
| 3 | A zealous priest who is constantly urging you to do more and do it better |
| 4 | An ambitious priest who views you as a ticket to advancement in the hierarchy |
| 5 | A retired adventurer who would rather do your work than direct you in it |
| 6 | A pious priest who sees the hands of the divine in every event, even the actions of unbelievers |
| 7 | A devout lay person who envies the magic and power your group wields |
| 8 | A practical functionary who tries to keep your work isolated from the knowledge and influence of the priests |

### Other Religious Orders
In addition to the Templars of the Silver Flame, several other groups might sponsor your party, such as the following organizations:

**The Deathguard**. This elite order of elven priests and warriors from Aerenal is sworn to destroy all evil undead.

**The Devout of the Celestial Crown.** One of many liturgical councils that serve a mostly administrative role for the priests of the Sovereign Host, the Devout manage a large portion of the city of Sharn.

**The Gatekeepers**. This ancient druid sect seeks to defend nature against aberrations, fiends, and undead.

## University
An institution of higher education sponsors your group. You might be researchers, bodyguards for scholars, or glorified treasure hunters searching for ancient artifacts. The university might regularly employ you or you might have a contact at the university who pays you any time you bring back something useful from your adventures. You could be a team of academics, or you could be employed to provide some (physical and magical) muscle that the university otherwise lacks.

### Morgrave University
At the heart of Sharn's Morgrave University is a sharp dichotomy: On the one hand, it is known as a nexus for scholars wishing to study Xen'drik, thanks in large part to Sharn's proximity to the secret continent. Its collections of artifacts and scholarly works about ancient Xen'drik and the Dhakaan Empire are unparalleled. In many ways, it lives up to the shining vision of its founder, Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave, to be "a beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city."

On the other hand, the university's reputation is tainted by allegations of smuggling, treasure hunting, and profiteering. Many priceless relics recovered from Xen'drik or Dhakaani ruins have disappeared from the university vaults and found their way to the black market or into the hands of the Aurum. It's an open secret that some scholars, professors, and even students at the university have ties to smugglers and thieves. All these allegations, too, have ties to the university's founding: Lord Morgrave himself is said to have made his fortune selling Dhakaani artifacts on the black market, and some have claimed that the true purpose of the university was to help him build his fortune through such questionable means.

***Allies.*** The academic world is relatively small, and people at any one university tend to have connections at others. You might parlay such relationships into assistance from academies and institutions, such as the following organizations:

**Flamewind**. The sphinx Flamewind (described in the "Immortal Being" section) isn't officially affiliated with the university, but she lives there and spends much of her time in its libraries and museums. As a scholar of the Draconic Prophecy, Flamewind often poses strange questions and sends adventurers on obscure missions.

**Library of Korranberg**. The Library of Korranberg boasts the greatest collection of learning in Khorvaire. Its prestige means that people associated with it often look down on their colleagues at Morgrave University, but they still celebrate the two institutions' common purpose of pursuing knowledge. If Morgrave's own libraries are insufficient for the task at hand, your group can probably find help in Korranberg.

**The Twelve**. For many scholars of magical studies, the idea of pursuing their research under the auspices of the Twelve is a cherished dream. Some faculty members at Morgrave have had the opportunity to do just that, and many others have nurtured connections to the Twelve in an attempt to secure that honor. Those connections can give your group access to powerful magic and the other resources of the Twelve.

**Wayfinder Foundation**. Morgrave maintains extensive connections with the Wayfinder Foundation—an exclusive guild for adventurers, which funds expeditions to distant locales. Should your group needs a grant or resources from the Wayfinders, a letter of recommendation from someone at Morgrave carries some weight.

***Enemies.*** Morgrave University has few true enemies but many rivals. Despite the friendly ties among academic institutions, Morgrave occupies the low end of the prestige scale among academic bodies, so its faculty tends to look for opportunities to steal glory from its academic peers. Beyond rivalries with allied organizations, Morgrave openly competes with the following group:

**University of Wynarn**. Foremost among Morgrave's rivals is Aundair's University of Wynarn, whose administrators have been known to refer to Morgrave as an "institute of learning, relic hunting, and grave robbing." The University of Wynarn is ancient—the first university established in the Five Nations—and more prestigious than Morgrave. It sponsors many of the same kind of expeditions and can boast many great discoveries, yet, somehow, Morgrave is more famous, and that stings many among the university's staff.

### Patron Benefits
With a university as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:

**Compensation**. The university pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment influences how you are paid. On average, the university pays each member of your group 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Or you might be paid a bounty for each ancient artifact you bring back from your adventures and give to the university.

**Documentation**. Each member of your group has identification papers that include your affiliation with the university, which carries some clout in academic circles. The university also secures documentation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers for you if your work requires them. Finally, if your adventures take you to Xen'drik, the university secures the necessary letters of marque issued by the king of Breland, which grant you permission to explore the ruins there.

**Research**. Research might be part of your group's job, but your patron has abundant resources to facilitate it. You can call in a favor to delegate the work of researching lore (a downtime activity described in the *Player's Handbook* or *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*) to a colleague, contact, or research assistant. You're responsible for covering all expenses occurred as part of this research, and the DM determines the success, failure, or other possible results.

**Resources**. Most universities have extensive libraries and museums, which you have access to. You can call in a favor to gain access to resources that are generally not on exhibit—dangerous relics or possibly magic items, spellbooks, and the like. Additionally, the faculty of your university might make it possible for you to consult with experts in various fields—so long as you can coax them away from their work.

**Training**. Because you're associated with the university, you receive a discount on any education you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as a downtime activity (as described in the *Player's Handbook* or *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*), you pay only one-half the normal cost, assuming that what you are studying is something the university teaches. Training in languages, musical instruments, and other tools might also be available, at the DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain proficiency in the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skills by this method, as if you were learning a language. A character can only learn one of these skills in this way.

### Build Your Group
A group sponsored by a university might look very much like any other adventuring party, with a range of diverse skills and capabilities. The only significant distinction lies between characters who are scholars and those who are more traditional adventurers. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:

**Field Researcher**. The academic in your group might also be a character with plenty of training and experience in the dangerous life of an adventurer. Sometimes called tomb raiders or grave robbers, such characters know that groundbreaking work requires firsthand experience with the creatures, cultures, forces, and histories being investigated, and the best way to get that is in the field. This role is similar to the Scholar, but the Field Researcher is armed with combat-oriented spells that supplement the knowledge-focused capabilities of the Scholar, preparing them to face those who guard the world's greatest secrets.

![[067-1-52.png|right|300]](Morgrave University)

**Financier**. Whether they're hunting for grants or seeking donations from wealthy philanthropists, the Financier seeks the funds to pay for academic expeditions. Such characters might know their ways around ballrooms, boardrooms, and seedy taverns, willing to do whats necessary to get what they need. Those in this role often exude Charisma and might be adept with the Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion skills. Bards and rogues make natural academic Financiers, as do those with the charlatan and noble backgrounds.

**Research Assistant**. Whether their seeking to graduate, get published, or make their academic mark, the Research Assistant's fate is likely tied up in the success of another scholar or a specific project. Alternatively, the Research Assistant might just be along for the ride, helping a professor merely to pass a course. Regardless, such characters might come from any class or background and could have skills gathered from experiences far outside the academic sphere. While there are certainly legitimate Research Assistants who honestly pursue their studies, this role might suit characters without academic interests.

**Scholar**. Likely possessing a high Intelligence score and a focus on learning and research, the Scholar in your party might represent the academic emphasis of the university. This character is often a noncombatant, a professor or student the rest of the party protects. Alternatively, they might live a dual life, shedding their academic persona as soon as they're off campus grounds. The Scholar might also be a nonplayer character, or the role could be filled by a player character whose spells and training don't include combat. A wizard whose spellbook is filled with utility-focused spells makes a fine Scholar, as might some clerics and monks. In any case, the sage background is an obvious choice for the Scholar, with acolyte and hermit also providing fine alternatives. Proficiency in skills such as Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion often proves useful for this character.

### Scholarly Missions
Decide as a group, in consultation with your DM, what kind of work your group does for the university. Consult the Scholarly Missions table to determine what sort of adventures you undertake.

##### Scholarly Missions
| d6 | Mission |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Adventurous Archeology**. Your focus is on finding ancient artifacts and bringing back what you can. |
| 2 | **Arcane Research**. Your team focuses on acquiring magical knowledge that can only be found outside the university walls. |
| 3 | **Investigative Ecology**. None can say how many amazing creatures make their homes in the world's wildest reaches, but you're dedicated to finding out. |
| 4 | **Historical Research**. Your team's work involves learning more about Eberron's long history. |
| 5 | **Radical Engineering**. The birth of a new race wasn't the peak of magical and mechanical engineering, it was just the beginning of new scientific fields you now explore. |
| 6 | **Exploration**. Khorvaire is a vast continent, and areas beyond the heartland of the Five Nations are poorly charted. Your focus is on understanding the wilder places of the world, as well as distant cultures. |

### Scholarly Standing
Academics live and die by their reputation. Some stand as embodiments of their fields of expertise, others might be considered con artists who stigmatize whole academic fields. Roll on or choose an option from the Scholarly Standing table to determine what other people think about your research.

##### Scholarly Standing
| d6 | Standing |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Revolutionary**. Your work has upended scholarly consensus and reshaped the way other academics think about your field. Each new discovery you make is received with acclaim. |
| 2 | **Respected**. Your work is considered noteworthy, though not revolutionary. Scholars in your field follow your writing and efforts with interest. |
| 3 | **Anonymous**. Try as you might, you can't earn positive or negative attention. Even worse, after you've published your findings, more prominent scholars have made similar statements to much acclaim. |
| 4 | **Misguided**. Your theories challenge scholarly consensus and are discounted. A prominent scholar argues against your conclusions, and their voice carries the day... for now. |
| 5 | **Fringe**. You work on the edges of your field, advocating bizarre theories that challenge scholarly consensus and seem patently outrageous, even scandalous. |
| 6 | **Fraud**. For right or wrong, many in the academic community believe you have invented at least some of your "findings" to earn attention. |

### University Contacts
With a university as your patron, you are part of a sprawling bureaucracy—maybe deep in the tangles of it or, more likely, lingering at the edges. Wherever you sit in the network of colleges, administrators, and faculty, a single person serves as your primary point of contact, someone who has a significant impact on the nature of your relationship with the university. Reference the University Contact table to help determine who manages the relationship between you and the university.

##### University Contact
| d8 | Contact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An overworked department head who doesn't quite know what to make of you but gives you work to keep you busy |
| 2 | A career bureaucrat who insists you file paperwork in multiple offices in order to get anything done |
| 3 | A junior professor who might be more interested in selling plundered artifacts than in actual research |
| 4 | A department secretary who thinks you're a great deal more interesting than any of the regular faculty |
| 5 | An erudite dean who believes you have tremendous potential and urges you on to greater endeavors |
| 6 | An energetic librarian or museum curator who addresses every question, assignment, or acquisition with disproportionate enthusiasm |
| 7 | A tired senior professor whose only joy in academia is seeing what you bring back from your adventures |
| 8 | An eager researcher who wants to come with you on every adventure because second-hand reports are always incomplete and unsatisfying |

### Other Universities

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Profits trump promises at Black market University
>>In response to last week's exclusive report detailing a scheme to remove precious antiquities from storage at Morgrave University and sell them on the black market, Master Larrian ir'Morgrave has issued a statement full of the usual platitudes and empty promises we have grown accustomed to hearing from the Office of the University Master. In it, ir'Morgrave vows to put an end to the criminal activities occurring within the university and bolster the school's academic reputation. As regular readers of this paper know, he makes such promises frequently, but we have yet to see him take any substantive action to back up his promises.
>>

Numerous universities exist across Khorvaire. Morgrave University is the one most often connected to adventurous exploits, but the following institutes number among Khorvaire's other prominent academic bodies:

**Arcanix**. Housed in elegant towers that float above southern Aundair, Arcanix is a place of arcane learning, where the next generation of spellcasters studies the intricacies of magic. The mentors at Arcanix comprise the Arcane Congress, a council of spellcasters who explore the limits of the arcane arts under a mandate instituted by King Galifar I.

**Rekkenmark**. The Military Academy of Rekkenmark has trained Galifar officers for hundreds of years and continues to excel as the premier combat training facility in all of Khorvaire. Nobles from every nation used to send their children to Rekkenmark for at least part of their education, but the Last War put an end to that practice. Now that the war is over, the academy hopes to welcome students from other nations once again, but so far only a handful of students from outside Galifar have come to Rekkenmark.

**Library of Korranberg**. Zilargo's Library of Korranberg is the greatest repository of general knowledge in Khorvaire. More than just a library, it hosts eight attached colleges dedicated to different fields of study, drawing gentry from across Khorvaire who come to study there. In addition to serving as a resource for scholars and explorers, the library often funds expeditions to study ancient cultures or unexplored lands.

# Chapter 2: Khorvaire Gazetteer
*Just one century ago, the Kingdom of Galifar spanned most of Khorvaire. Of course, we never tamed the lands beyond the Graywall Mountains or the jungles of the east. Nevertheless, it was impressive, this kingdom of humanity's.**Now I look at the map of Khorvaire with a touch of despair. Galifar lies shattered, the Five Nations irreparably divided. So many new realms claim sovereignty—kingdoms of elves and goblins, and what of this nation of monsters called Droaam? Can it last, or will another war fracture us further? Should I dwell on such things when the Mourning might simply consume us all? Gods, how I fear the future.*— Lyrian Das, Morgrave historianMost player characters begin their adventures on the continent of Khorvaire, as shown on the poster map included with this book and on *map 2.1*. Although humans make up the majority of the population in the nations of Khorvaire, the continent is home to a wide range of peoples and cultures. Once largely unified under the Kingdom of Galifar, today Khorvaire is split into many nations—some old, others newly born from the crucible of war. This chapter provides an overview of Khorvaire, a glimpse of the world that lies beyond it, and the predominant faiths of Eberron.

![[068-2-01.jpg|right|300]](A Lyrandar airship ventures toward the dead-gray mist of the Mournland.)

## Nations of Khorvaire
The following sections focus on what you need to know to create characters and NPCs from Khorvaire. For general information about the Kingdom of Galifar, the Five Nations that arose from the kingdom's ashes, and the Treaty of Thronehold that helps keeps the peace between the nations of Khorvaire, see the introduction of this book.

An excellent system of roads connects the central nations of Khorvaire, and travelers can always make their way by horse or coach. Major cities are linked by the lightning rail of House Orien, which allows one to avoid the perils—and tedium—of the roads. If speed is an issue, one can book passage on a House Lyrandar airship. This is the fastest way to travel, but also the most expensive. This book's introduction has more information about these and other travel options.

![[069-map-khorvaire.jpg|right|300]](Map 2.1: the Continent of Khorvaire)

## Aundair
**Capital**: Fairhaven

**Hallmarks**: Cheese, education, fashion, grains, wine, wizardry

Fertile farmlands surround the grand cities of Aundair. The floating towers of Arcanix are the finest institute for mystical study in Khorvaire, and magic is deeply ingrained in Aundairian culture. The nation produces more magewrights and wandslingers than any other in Khorvaire.

From the nobles lounging in the towers of Fairhaven to the common folk working the vast vineyards of Bluevine, Aundairians value wit and wisdom. Aundairians prefer finesse to brute force and appreciate cunning wordplay and fine fashions. The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of Aundair, with a particular devotion to Aureon. However, the Silver Flame also maintains a devoted following—some might say overzealous.

Although Aundair is a small nation, its arcane superiority allowed it retain its dominion during the Last War. The people of Aundair know that knowledge is power, and they take pride in their nation's magical advancements. To ensure her nation's prosperity and dominance, Queen Aurala ir'Wynarn instituted the Arcane Initiative, an aggressive series of programs intended to forward the development of mystical infrastructure and battle magic.

### Interesting Things About Aundair
- Arcanix is the most prestigious academy of magic in Khorvaire. Most of its sages specialize in ritual magic and abstract theory, and don't have the full powers of wizards.
- Magic permeates many aspects of Aundairian life—more so than other nations. A *cleansing stone* (see *chapter 5*) graces every village, and you might encounter animated farming equipment in the fields. The Knights Arcane are an elite unit of eldritch knights, and the spies of the Royal Eyes of Aundair specialize in divination magic.
- Some Aundairian nobles are bound by arcane pacts handed down through generations. Only remarkable heirs—such as player characters—develop into warlocks. Most such lines have an Archfey patron.

### Aundairian Characters
Regardless of your Intelligence score, as an Aundairian you're sure you're the smartest person in the room. Consider the following characteristics for your Aundairian:

**Arcane Talent**. If you're not going to play a magic-using class, consider creating a high elf or a human with the Magic Initiate feat. Whether you favor damage-dealing cantrips or more utilitarian ones, every Aundairian should know a little magic.

**Magic Beats Mundane**. Why use your hand when you could use *mage hand*? Why strain your muscles tugging on a bowstring when you could use a wand?

**Show Some Style**. Don't settle for common clothes and a squalid meal when you could wear *glamerweave* (see *chapter 5*) and drink the finest wine. If you're a fighter, focus on finesse instead of crude strength. And never miss an opportunity for a clever quip.

### Cities and Sites
Aundair intersperses pastoral farmlands between densely populated cities.

![[070-2-02.png|right|300]](Arcanix)

#### Arcanix
This farming village on Lake Galifar provides food for the nearby floating towers of wizardry that serve as home to Aundair's Arcane Congress—a cutting-edge research facility and the finest school of magic in Khorvaire. The members of the congress oversee the magical research conducted in these towers, advise Aundair's queen on all things magical, and confer with colleagues visiting from other nations.

Apprentices come from all over Khorvaire to train at Arcanix. If you're a wizard, sage, or artificer, you might have learned your craft here.

#### Fairhaven
The capital of Aundair is one of the most beautiful cities in Eberron. Stunning displays of magical light and other arcane wonders enhance the exquisite architecture. This is the seat of the University of Wynarn, a prestigious institution that draws students from across Khorvaire. As a noble, entertainer, or sage, you might have your roots in the City of Lights.

>> ##### The Korranberg Chronicle—wizard war brewing at arcanix?
>>Before the war, the Arcane Congress served all Galifar. The most promising students from across Khorvaire came to study at Arcanix, and students from Khorvaire, Cyre, and Aundair worked together to win honor in the Trials of the Ninefold Path. Known to students simply as the Nine, this contest pits students of the eight traditions against one another in a series of arcane challenges, along with a ninth bracket for those who have yet to select a tradition. Teamwork, independence, memorization, innovation—the Nine challenges competitors on many levels, and the finest wizards of Galifar were invariably champions of the Nine.
>>
>>Thanks to the Treaty of Thronehold, students of all nations once again study side by side in the towers of Arcanix. But no treaty or ritual can easily dispel the tensions of a century of war. Over the last year we've reported on a number of hate crimes in the towers fueled by nationalist passions. Optimistic teachers hope that the Nine will showcase the diversity that has evolved over the course of the past century—highlighting Karrnathi advances in necromancy and evocation, Cyran illusions, and more. But privately, professors fear that the competitive aspect of the Nine will inflame nationalist tension. Some even believe that the lives of foreign students could be endangered should they defeat Aundairian champions.
>>
>>Only time will tell if the Nine can bring us together as it once did, or if it will drive us further apart.
>>

#### Passage
Located on the shores of Lake Galifar, the city of Passage is the heart of the dragonmarked House Orien. Resources include production and maintenance facilities for the lightning rail and the Orien caravans. If you have the Mark of Passage, odds are good you've spent time here.

#### Stormhome
This island city is the seat of House Lyrandar, and Queen Aurala allows the house a free rein in governing the isle. It is the finest resort and vacation spot in Khorvaire. Spies, charlatans, sailors, and house agents all have a place in Stormhome. Even though the island escaped the devastation wrought during the Last War, it remains a hotbed for clandestine activities.

Lyrandar wizards use magic to continuously alter Stormhome's weather, turning the otherwise bleak and storm-blasted location into a temperate island getaway.

### Aftermath of the Last War
Aundair and Thrane were bitter rivals during the Last War. Thrane seized the ancient city of Thaliost during the war and holds it to this day. Most of the people of Aundair remain furious about the occupation of Thaliost, but the city has become a haven for Aundairians who revere the Silver Flame.

The Eldeen Reaches seceded from Aundair halfway through the Last War. The western farmers rebelled over high taxes and neglect, allying with the druids of the Towering Wood. Aundair was forced to accept the sovereignty of the Reaches under the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, but many Aundairians view it as a renegade nation.

Extensive use of magic has repaired most of the damage to the cities of Aundair, but the countryside remains scarred by the war, especially along the border with Thrane. The Crying Fields are a region of farmlands permanently scarred by magic and haunted by restless spirits. Aundairians claim their nation is stronger than ever, but some worry about the long-term impact of the loss of the Eldeen farmlands and the Crying Fields.

Now, Aundairians debate over differing views of their nation's future. Some believe the first focus should be reuniting Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, whether through diplomacy or force. Others consider Thaliost to be the pressing issue. And still others support Queen Aurala's claim to the throne of Galifar. When creating an Aundairian, consider whether you have ties to any of the affected regions and if this influences your opinion of Thranes or druids.

## Breland
**Capital**: Wroat

**Hallmarks**: Espionage, industry, metalwork, organized crime, subterfuge

In the wake of the Last War, Breland is one of the most powerful nations in Khorvaire. Possessing a large population and abundant resources, Breland leads the continent in industry.

The Brelish are known for their pragmatism and independence. They lack the discipline of Karrns and the faith of the Thranes, but they excel at finding innovative solutions to problems. The Brelish also have a talent for intrigue and subterfuge. The King's Dark Lanterns is one of the finest intelligence agencies in Khorvaire, rivaled only by House Phiarlan and the Trust of Zilargo. The dark side of these aptitudes is a strong streak of cynicism, which allows crime and corruption to flourish in Brelish cities and temples. The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Breland, but in general the Brelish aren't as devout as citizens of other nations.

King Boranel ir'Wynarn rules Breland in conjunction with an elected parliament. Boranel is a popular leader celebrated for his exploits during the Last War, but his children have yet to prove themselves, and a growing movement advocates for abandoning royal rule when Boranel passes.

### Interesting Things About Breland
- Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire. Almost a nation in its own right, the City of Towers is a hub for commerce and intrigue. Chapter 3 provides more information on Sharn.
- The Boromar Clan is the oldest and most powerful criminal organization in Breland. The Boromar halfling leadership maintains ties to the Talenta Plains. Other notable criminal organizations include the monsters of Daask and House Tarkanan, an alliance of assassins and thieves with aberrant dragonmarks (see *chapter 4* for more about these crime syndicates).
- Breland's major cities are highly cosmopolitan. Due to its proximity to Droaam, Breland's cities include more monsters—ogres, orcs, goblins, and even sahuagin, harpies, and gargoyles—than elsewhere in the Five Nations.

### Brelish Characters
As you develop a Brelish character or NPC, consider the following qualities:

**Slightly Shady**. Many Brelish have a loose relationship with the law. Even if you're a hero, you might have questionable connections or friends in low places. Backgrounds such as criminal, spy, or charlatan can reflect this tendency, regardless of your class. You could also be a folk hero who challenges the laws to protect the innocent, or an entertainer who plays in every dive in Sharn.

**Innovative and Independent**. Find your own path in the world; don't simply follow established traditions. As a cleric, you might challenge your church and follow your own divine revelations. As a wizard, you could search for new techniques or attempt to unravel forgotten secrets.

**Practical**. Whether it's about fashion, food, or conversation, the Brelish tend to be pragmatic. Why spend a fortune on a fancy meal when a simple one will do? You use whatever tool gets the job done, and you don't see a need for unnecessary flair.

### Cities and Sites
Beyond the magnificence of Sharn, Breland hosts a vast spectrum of other wonders.

#### Argonth
The floating fortress of Breland, Argonth is one of the marvels of the Last War. The product of House Cannith ingenuity and Brelish industrial might, Argonth is the largest engine of war ever built. This moving city is home to thousands of soldiers. Currently Argonth patrols the edge of the Mournland, but if tensions rise with Droaam or Darguun, the fortress can be deployed to reinforce a threatened border.

As a Brelish soldier or spy, you might have served aboard Argonth for a time before some incident led you to become an adventurer.

#### Black Pit
A massive chasm in the Blackcap Mountains, the Black Pit is over a mile across and descends beyond the limits of sight. It's said to be an entrance to the abyss of Khyber, and foul creatures live among the caves that honeycomb its walls. A nearby village—also called Black Pit—provides a haven for deserters and other criminals as well as a thriving black market.

If you have shady friends, you've likely heard of Black Pit's reputation as a place to quietly "disappear." Similarly, if you have ties to the King's Dark Lanterns, you know where to find some of Breland's worst criminals.

#### New Cyre
What began as a refugee camp has evolved into a struggling town hosting thousands of Cyran refugees. Prince Oargev holds court in New Cyre, considering himself a king in exile. Though resources are scarce, New Cyre remains a symbol of hope for many refugees. It's also a last stop for those determined to explore the Mournland.

#### Sharn
The City of Towers is described in chapter 3. Law and chaos dance on a knife's edge here, one never truly gaining advantage over the other.

#### Vathirond
Throughout the Last War, this town was beset by armies from Thrane, Cyre, and Karrnath. Vathirond's residents still hold grudges against these close foreign neighbors. However, their attention of late has been focused on the Mournland. Nameless horrors have begun to slip into Breland from the east at an alarming rate, and Brelish soldiers and adventurers stationed in Vathirond are usually the first to contend with these threats.

#### Wroat
Built on both sides of the Howling River at a point where the river widens, the ancestral seat of the rulers of Breland seduces visitors with its tree-lined avenues, elegant drawbridges, cleanliness, and laid-back atmosphere. Perched on a rocky island in the middle of the river, surrounded by military docks and barracks, is Brokenblade Castle, the king's stern fortress.

In contrast to its welcoming countenance, Wroat casts dark shadows, and much goes on quietly behind closed doors. The absence of beggars and riffraff in the streets might also raise suspicion that Wroat is putting on appearances. The King's Dark Lanterns are ever vigilant here, and newcomers who aim to misbehave tend to disappear quickly and without so much as a whisper.

![[071-2-03.png|right|300]](Argonth)

### Aftermath of the Last War

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Winter Palace under siege
>>Although untouched by a century of war, the Winter Palace suffered an attack from an unexpected quarter: the people of Breland. The so-called Swords of Liberty have taken credit for a daring raid that left the east wing of the palace in flames. No members of the Brelish royal family were in attendance during the attack.
>>
>>The Swords of Liberty call for the violent overthrow of the Wynarn monarchy, demanding that all power be invested in the Brelish parliament. Their manifesto draws on the speeches of Lord Ruken ir'Clarn, but Lord Ruken has condemned their action. "No victory is possible when Brelish fight Brelish," he said in Wroat. "But I hope King Boranel can see that the time for change is upon us and help us navigate a peaceful transition of power before any more innocents are hurt."
>>

For Breland, the Last War was an ever-shifting tangle of enemies and alliances. Breland fought Aundair, Cyre, Karrnath, and Thrane at various points of the war, as well as clashing with Darguun and Droaam. These conflicts caused many Brelish to embrace a cynical view of the world, a sense that no one can be fully trusted and that people need to look out for themselves. As a Brelish character, you could have an axe to grind against any of the other nations. This is balanced against a strong belief in humanoid rights and dignity, convictions that motivated the Brelish to shelter more Cyran refugees than any other nation.

The major cities of Breland host significant populations of refugees, both Cyrans and Brelish from villages lost in the war. This has increased the overall level of poverty and desperation and contributed to an increase in crime. The southern cities—including Wroat and Sharn—suffered relatively little damage in the war, but northern Breland was hard hit. The city of Vathirond is still repairing the damage from Thrane attacks, and many northern villages are either recovering or have simply been abandoned.

Despite these struggles, the Brelish maintain a positive view of their future. The heart of Breland is as strong as it ever was, and the citizens believe that had the war continued, Breland would have triumphed.

## Cyre (The Mournland)
**Capital**: Metrol (destroyed)

**Previous Hallmarks**: Art, artifice, jewelry, music, oratory, philosophy

**Current Hallmarks**: Destruction, ruins

Destroyed at the end of the Last War, Cyre now exists only in the hearts of the refugees scattered across Khorvaire.

Before the war, Cyre was the seat of the kings and queens of Galifar. The wealth of the kingdom flowed through Cyre, and it was a nexus for commerce and culture. By tradition, Cyre's Princess Mishann had the rightful claim to the throne of Galifar. Cyrans take pride that they alone were in the right in the Last War, but they unquestionably lost more to the war than any other nation. As a Cyran, you stand on the moral high ground, but that may offer little comfort.

Cyrans like to say that their culture represented the best that Galifar had to offer, which is to say a little bit of everything. Cyrans value diversity and versatility, both in talents and thought. Cyre couldn't match Karrnath in martial discipline or Aundair in the arcane arts, but the flexibility of its forces reflected the nation's ideals.

Although the Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of Cyre, the Silver Flame had a significant following. Many survivors question their faith in the wake of the Mourning, but some believe that their anguish at the loss of their homeland is a divine trial, prompting them to cling to their faith more than ever.

Queen Dannel ir'Wynarn was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning and is presumed dead. Her son, Prince Oargev ir'Wynarn, holds court in New Cyre, a massive refugee camp set up in Breland. Some refugees support Oargev and the dream of a restored Cyre, while others prefer to focus on the future instead of trying to reclaim the past. As a Cyran, you should decide whether you hold tight to your national identity, or instead consider yourself to be an expatriate without a nation.

### Interesting Things About Cyre (The Mournland)
- Cyre was the ancestral seat of the dragonmarked House Cannith, the house of Making. The house maintained arcane workshops across Cyre. Who knows what treasures wait in Cannith vaults for those who brave the dangers of the Mournland?
- While not as flamboyant as Aundairians, Cyran fashions involved bright colors and *glamerweave* (see *chapter 5*). Some Cyrans have made a point of continuing this custom. Others wear clothing cut in the Cyran style, but entirely in black; this has become known as Mourning wear.
- Stories say communities of warforged live in the Mournland, including the insurgent called **the Lord of Blades**.

### Cyran Characters
When creating a character from Cyre, consider the following questions:

**What Have You Lost?** Did you lose wealth or status? Did you have family or loved ones killed in the Mourning? Did you lose something you could one day recover from the Mournland—arcane research, an heirloom artifact, or a precious family relic? Consider the impact the disaster has on your background. As a Cyran noble or soldier, your estates have been lost and your army scattered, but you still have the respect of your comrades or peers.

**What Do You Hold Onto?** Do you have a trinket that embodies Cyre for you? Is your wand or weapon an heirloom of your family? As an entertainer or guild artisan, do you preserve a particular Cyran tradition?

**What Drives You**? Are you determined to solve the mystery of the Mourning? Do you want to help other refugees, or are you concerned only with your personal survival? Is there something you want to recover from the Mournland, or would you prefer to never set foot in Cyre again? Do you hold a grudge against the nations that fought against Cyre in the war, or are you solely concerned with the future?

### Cities and Sites
Cyre was devastated by the Mourning. Its ruins have become grim reminders of the folly of war. Unknown threats both magical and monstrous haunt the Mournland. For more about the Mournland as it stands now, see *chapter 4*.

#### Eston
Once the seat of House Cannith, this was a place of wonders—a city where "magic comes to life." Marvels of the city included the Clockwork Menagerie, showcasing the golems and homunculi made by generations of artificers; production facilities that housed three creation forges (see *chapter 5*), and the miraculous Steel Gardens, an early breakthrough that paved the way for the living warforged. If you're an artificer or have ties to House Cannith, you might have roots in Eston.

#### Metrol
Once the capital of Galifar, Metrol was known as the Rising City, for many of its buildings stood atop soaring columns of rock that dared to scrape the heavens. The Cathedral of the Sovereign Host was the center for followers of that faith. The Vault served as the mint and treasury of Galifar, containing cultural treasures deemed too valuable to be displayed; salvagers dream of finding this "golden palace." Floating gardens orbited the towering Royal Vermishard. Now lost, the beauty of Metrol lives only in Cyran memory.

#### Seaside
A coastal town in southern Cyre, Seaside was a popular vacation spot even during the war. While not as celebrated a destination as Stormhome in Aundair, the memory of Seaside has become an iconic image of peace and tranquility for the people of Cyre.

### Aftermath of the Last War
No nation won the Last War, but Cyre unquestionably lost it. Other nations are recovering from the conflict, but Cyre is gone. The lands not destroyed in the Mourning were lost decades earlier to Darguun and Valenar. Cyrans who survived the war must now carve out a new destiny in the lands of their enemies or in foreign nations beyond what was once the Kingdom of Galifar.

In creating a Cyran character, first determine how you survived the Mourning. Were you outside Cyre when it occurred, or did you somehow escape the destruction? Where did you take shelter? Breland has taken in refugees and created refugee camps. Thrane also accepted refugees but has worked to disperse and integrate them into the general population. Are you grateful or bitter? Do you have family or friends in refugee camps, or are you a lone survivor? Other Cyrans sought opportunities on the frontiers, settling in the jungles of Q'barra or seeking a new life in the distant land of Xen'drik.

Many Cyran survivors are soldiers, veterans stationed on the front lines when the Mourning occurred. If multiple members of your party are Cyrans, you might have served together during the Last War. Because Cyrans are so widely dispersed, you can encounter former comrades or friends anywhere in Khorvaire.

Since Cyrans lost their lands, the distinctions between peasant and aristocrat have become moot. Even with a criminal background, you might have been a viscount in Cyre; your background reflects your current standing and the resources you can call upon in the present.

## Darguun
**Capital**: Rhukaan Draal

**Hallmarks**: Dungeons, goblinoid mercenaries, ruins

Goblins and their kin have always been part of Khorvaire. Their ancient empire spread across the lands now held by other nations, and goblin foundations still stand underneath many human cities. This empire collapsed into savagery, and when humans arrived from Sarlona, they drove the goblins from their ancestral lands. Thus, goblins have long been a disenfranchised people, living in the shadows of newer nations or in wild lands shunned by humans.

The land now called Darguun was once part of Cyre. The hobgoblin clans known as the Ghaal'dar were based in the Seawall Mountains, but during the war, the demand for mercenaries drew an ever-increasing number of goblins out of the mountains to fight for Cyre and Breland. Late in the war, a brilliant hobgoblin named Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor recognized that the goblins had become the dominant military power in the region. Uniting the Ghaal'dar under his banner, Haruuc seized the territory he was supposed to protect. The Five Nations were unprepared, and Breland quickly negotiated an alliance with Haruuc to secure the border. Cyre fought the goblins until the Day of Mourning, but the majority of delegates involved in forging the Treaty of Thronehold chose to recognize the new nation of Darguun to ensure peace.

Darguun is a young and volatile nation, ruled by Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor. Haruuc remains a brilliant strategist and tactician, but many wonder whether he can maintain the web of alliances that hold the Ghaal'dar together, and whether he and his people will be content to abide by the terms of the treaty. Other goblins still hidden in the mountains—the enigmatic Heirs of Dhakaan (see *chapter 4*)—could pose a threat both to the goblins and the rest of Khorvaire.

Traditionally, the Ghaal'dar worshiped a form of the Dark Six. House Deneith introduced the Sovereign Host to the region, and some goblins have embraced this faith, especially the gods Dol Dorn, Dol Arrah, and Balinor.

### Interesting Things About Darguun
- House Deneith has a strong presence in Darguun. No one will employ goblin armies in the wake of Haruuc's betrayal, but security forces value smaller units of goblinoid mercenaries for their ferocity and skills.
- Darguun is a frontier nation. Although recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, it doesn't abide by the common laws of the treaty nations. Law enforcement is unpredictable, and acts considered criminal in other nations are part of life in Darguun.
- A number of bugbear-dominated clans known as the Marguul inhabit southern Darguun. Some of the Marguul refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Ghaal'dar hobgoblins; these clans are especially dangerous and violent.
- Lhesh Haruuc united the Ghaal'dar clans and seized control of Darguun nearly three decades ago. If you are a non-goblin from this land, you may have been born in captivity. Were you forced into bondage, or did you adopt Darguul customs and earn a place in their society?

### Darguul Characters
Darguun is a logical point of origin for goblin, hobgoblin, or bugbear characters. When creating a Ghaal'dar character from Darguun, consider the following:

**Constant Struggle**. Among the Ghaal'dar, you must constantly prove your strength and skill to gain and hold the respect of your kin. Ghaal'dar rarely kill in a casual battle; you might fight to prove a point but kill only when you must.

**Loyal to Your Clan.** Challenge your peers as you like in times of peace, but when blades unsheathe for war, you stand by your clan—or those allies you have bonded with—until death. This loyalty doesn't extend to warriors of other Ghaal'dar clans.

**Muut and Atcha**. Your ancestors once forged an empire even greater than Galifar. Perhaps you believe that your people can reclaim this lost glory. The Dhakaani were renowned for their martial skill and their discipline. *Muut* roughly translates to "duty"—your duty to your empire, your clan, and your commander. Muut is expected; if you have no muut, you have no place in battle. *Atcha* corresponds to "honor," especially your personal honor gained by virtuous deeds that transcend the expectations of muut.

### Cities and Sites
Thirty years ago, this region was part of Cyre. The goblins converted towns and villages and raised new settlements, but many ruins and abandoned farms remain. The region is also peppered with dungeons dating back to the ancient goblin empire; these can be found in the vast Torlaac Moor or beneath the Khraal rainforest.

#### The Gathering Stone
This fortress enclave of House Deneith serves as a staging area for goblin mercenaries who wish to work for the house. It provides a stable and secure haven for travelers passing through the region, provided you're on good terms with House Deneith.

#### Gorgonhorn
This fortified village lies close to the Mournland. Once it maintained the front line against Cyre. Now, the hobgoblins stationed here protect their people from the horrors that crawl out of the warped realm. If you're a goblin soldier, you might have served in Gorgonhorn. It's also a base for the scavengers and salvagers who venture into the Mournland.

#### Lyrenton
Once a thriving Cyran town, Lyrenton is a ruin on the very edge of the Mournland. It's shunned by the Ghaal'dar, who believe it to be cursed. At night, a terrible wailing that echoes among the ruins can be heard for miles across the plains.

#### Rhukaan Draal
The largest city in Darguun serves as the seat of Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor. As the hub for trade, travel, and diplomacy, it also a provides a haven for fugitives and smugglers. Lhesh Haruuc dwells in a fortress known as Khaar Mbar'ost, the Red House.

#### Wyvernskull
If you're a Ghaal'dar sailor or guild artisan, this small city—Darguun's primary seaport—could be your home. The goblinoids who live here are a sociable, rowdy lot who are also, by and large, friendly toward strangers.

![[072-2-04.png|right|300]](Dhakaani Ruins in the Seawall Mountains)

### Aftermath of the Last War
Darguun was born in the Last War, and the scars of its birth are still raw. Most of the Cyran population fled the goblin uprising, and those who remained were killed or enslaved. As a result, many burnt-out farms and abandoned villages have stood empty for decades. The broken paths of the lightning rail make travel into the interior difficult, and only the largest cities offer the basic services common elsewhere in the treaty nations.

Any significant settlement is likely the domain of a single Ghaal'dar clan. While these clans give their fealty to Lhesh Haruuc, every clan lord holds absolute power in their town. Some clans are friendly to outsiders and welcome commerce. Others despise non-goblins. Lhesh Haruuc has abolished slavery in Rhukaan Draal, but some of clan lords continue this practice.

Overall, Darguun is a nation that is still finding its identity—a kingdom that seeks to be more than a seized territory. The goblins carry the legacy of a mighty empire and stand in the shadow of the nations around them. Haruuc wants to draw out the best in his people, to harness their strengths and achieve their potential. The rest of Khorvaire waits to see if the Ghaal'dar have the will to remain a nation, and if Darguun can survive when Haruuc passes away.

## Demon Wastes
**Capital**: None

**Hallmarks**: Fiends, pestilence

Rivers of lava cut across plains of black sand and volcanic glass. The only vegetation consists of blood-red moss and a thick layer of shimmering slime. A jagged rock formation might be a piece of an ancient wall, if you stretch your imagination.

Tens of thousands of years ago, fiends ruled Khorvaire. The Demon Wastes held the seat of power for some of the mightiest archfiends, home to cities of rakshasas and demons. Most of these foul entities perished or fled long ago, but a few still linger in this place even as new ones crawl up from the depths of Khyber. A handful of primordial ruins sustained by dark magic dot the bleak landscape—ruins that may still be home to fiends and their treasures.

The Stone Cage, Shadowcrags, and Icehorn Mountains separate the Demon Wastes from the Eldeen Reaches. A series of canyons known as the Labyrinth further separate the Demon Wastes from the rest of Khorvaire. Due to ancient warding magic, any creature that wishes to leave must do so through the Labyrinth. These passes are guarded by the Ghaash'kala, tribes of orcs sworn to contain the evils of the Wastes. Beyond the Labyrinth, the mortal inhabitants of the Demon Wastes include a brutal people known as the Carrion Tribes. Each tribe is devoted to an archfiend, and they engage in endless battles against the Ghaash'kala and the other Carrion Tribes.

If you're creating a character from the Demon Wastes, you're likely associated with either the Ghaash'kala or one of the Carrion Tribes.

### Interesting Things About the Demon Wastes
- A variety of fiends inhabit the Wastes, including devils, rakshasas, and demons. These creatures are spawned by Khyber, not the Outer Planes.
- The Demon Wastes are riddled with portals to abyssal demiplanes, unearthly realms populated by fiends and other horrors. These inner realms include vast and twisted forests, living oceans, realms of rusted iron, and stranger places.

### Ghaash'kala Characters
The Ghaash'kala are primarily orcs, but their numbers include a few half-orcs and members of other races. They devote their lives to guarding the Labyrinth and containing the evils of the Wastes. When creating a Ghaash'kala character, consider the following:

**The Binding Flame**. The Ghaash'kala worship Kalok Shash, the "Binding Flame." Fundamentally the same religion as the Silver Flame, Kalok Shash is a harsh faith that requires all able-bodied folk to fight in the endless war against the forces of darkness.

**Sacred Champions**. As a Ghaash'kala, you are a champion of the Binding Flame. A paladin sworn to the Oath of Vengeance, a barbarian on the Path of the Zealot (found in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*), and a cleric of the Light or War domain all represent a logical path for a Ghaash'kala character. Outlander and hermit are appropriate backgrounds, reflecting your harsh upbringing or religious devotion.

### Carrion Tribes
The Carrion Tribes descend from explorers and refugees twisted by the evil in this realm. Explorers usually encounter these savage folk as enemies, but occasionally a hero emerges from the shadows. When creating a character from the Carrion Tribes, consider the following:

![[073-2-05.png|right|300]]

**Sworn to an Overlord.** Your tribe is devoted to an archfiend. This can serve as the roots of a warlock's pact or the inspiration for a barbarian's rage. Are you still loyal to your dark lord, or did you break free from its influence? Either way, work with the DM to develop the details of your overlord.

**Child of a Savage Land.** You were born into a lawless realm where violence was the only constant. How have you adapted to life on the other side of the Labyrinth? Are you superstitious, refusing to adapt to this new world, or are you doing your best to learn the ways of this strange realm?

**Why Did You Leave?** You began your life as a servant of darkness. Have you embraced the light? Are you fighting the servants of your former master? Or are you a pawn in a conflict between overlords? You might serve an evil force, but the cultists you fight serve even darker powers.

### Cities and Sites
Settlements are few and far between in the Demon Wastes. The Carrion Tribes are semi-nomadic, assembling camps in the crumbling ruins of long-forgotten cities built by demons in the first days of the world.

#### Ashtakala
Legends say that a single city of fiends remains intact. Stories describe Ashtakala as a city of basalt and brass, filled with rakshasas and demons. If it exists, it is shielded by powerful wards. Who knows what ancient artifacts and treasures it might contain?

#### Blood Crescent
House Tharashk established this tiny port at the end of the Last War. The house hopes to gain access to the dragonshard deposits buried in the Wastes. To date, it has survived the Carrion Tribes and the malefic horrors of the Wastes, but few believe it will last.

#### Desolate
Known at various times as Greenholt, Newholt, or Kymar's Folly, this outpost has served as an Aundairian settlement, a Thrane hermitage, and an outpost of House Lyrandar. It's fallen three times, and no one knows exactly how. Each time, its inhabitants have vanished in a single night, leaving all their possessions behind. Today it's known as Desolate, and it awaits the next band of settlers willing to stake their claim.

## Droaam

>> ##### The Korranberg Chronicle—Descent into Droaam: my trail to terror
>>*We're all going to die.* That thought echoed through my mind as the wagon carried us toward the Great Crag. The diplomats around me intended to speak with the Daughters of Sora Kell. All I could think about was the stories my grandmother used to tell me. *Sora Maenya can crush a giant with her bare hands. She can eat the whole creature and still be hungry. If you're bad, she'll come in the night and carry you away. She'll make a lantern of your skull and torment you until the end of time.* And she's the *least* frightening member of the Daughters of Sora Kell!
>>
>>When I could set aside my sheer terror, I was learning a great deal about this strange nation. The Daughters invested power in warlords, each of whom rules a territory in their name. It's sort of like Karrnath, except each of the warlords of Droaam is a horrifying monster. We were traveling through the territory of the Prince of Bones, an ancient troll said to be too evil to die. We'd already passed through the domain of Queen Sheska the medusa, where even the trees are turning to stone. Harpies. Gargoyles. There's even a king of the kobolds. Our caravan was being protected by gnolls. Not protected *from* gnolls, protected *by* gnolls. I thought things couldn't get any stranger. I couldn't have been more wrong....
>>

**Capital**: The Great Crag

**Hallmarks**: Byeshk ore, monstrous mercenaries

Droaam is a nation of monsters ruled by the Daughters of Sora Kell. Each of these three hags is a legend in her own right, the subjects of tales used to frighten children. Eleven years ago, they seized the lands west of the Graywall Mountains and founded the nation of Droaam.

Although Breland laid claim to these barren lands, Galifar had never tamed this wild region. Gnolls, orcs, and goblins commonly sought haven here, as well as ogres, trolls, harpies, minotaurs, medusas, tieflings, changelings, lycanthropes, and other races unwelcome in civilized lands. In the past, these creatures fought one another more often than they raided human settlements. Under the leadership of the Daughters of Sora Kell, they have new purpose. The Daughters use an army of ogres and war trolls to maintain order.

To date, the other nations of Khorvaire have refused to recognize Droaam, and the region was not acknowledged in the Treaty of Thronehold. Most people believe that the monstrous nation can't last—that even the Daughters can't hold the disparate alliance together—but Droaam is currently thriving and stronger than ever.

Droaam works closely with House Tharashk, selling the services of monstrous soldiers and laborers and byeshk ore, a form of metal with magical properties. Beyond that, it's a still-expanding frontier nation. The cities of Graywall and Great Crag grow larger and more organized every day, and the rest of Khorvaire is uneasy with the potential power of a fully realized Droaam.

The monsters that inhabit Droaam retain their racial subcultures. Most worship the Dark Six, but other religious traditions flourish as well.

### Interesting Things About Droaam
- Droaam uses the supernatural abilities of its citizens as tools, just as other nations of Khorvaire use magic. The Daughters of Sora Kell keep their people fed with troll sausage and use harpy's song to quell brawls. When dealing with monsters in Droaam, consider the practical applications of their abilities.
- When the Church of the Silver Flame purged lycanthropy from the Five Nations, a number of lycanthropes escaped into the region that later become Droaam. The Dark Pack alliance of lycanthropes, worgs, and other supernatural predators hunts southern Droaam.

### Droaamite Characters
Minotaurs, orcs, gnolls, tieflings, changelings, and other monstrous species all have a place in Droaam. Consider these questions when making a Droaamite character:

**What Makes You Different?** The people of Droaam aren't just humans with horns or green skin. Think about the unique aspects of your people and what makes you different from humanity, both physically and culturally.

**What Are Your Ambitions?** Citizens of Droaam are proud of their nation. You know that the rest of Khorvaire considers you a monster. Do you intend to prove that you and your kind are capable of deeds humanity can't imagine? Or are you driven solely by your personal desires, or the goals of your family or warlord?

**How Does Your Background Shape You?** The diverse creatures of Droaam could include a kobold city-savvy rogue urchin, an orc outlander barbarian with little knowledge of the outside world, or a tiefling warlock sage versed in Arcana and History.

### Cities and Sites
In the past, particular creatures dominated the communities of Droaam. The harpy flights lived in mountain peaks, while the medusas remained isolated in the citadel of Cazhaak Draal. Under the rule of the Daughters of Sora Kell, the Droaamites are creating cities where all manner of creatures live and work together.

#### Graywall
Known as the Gateway to Droaam, this city sits on the border to Breland. Though dominated by monsters and ruled by a mind flayer, Graywall is both a center for trade and a haven for deserters and fugitives. The dragonmarked houses maintain outposts in Graywall, and House Tharashk governs the Calabas, the foreign quarter inhabited by humans and other people from elsewhere in Khorvaire.

#### The Great Crag
Built atop ancient goblin ruins, the Crag is the seat of the Daughters of Sora Kell. Few outsiders have seen this thriving city of monsters. Of the dragonmarked houses, only House Tharashk has a presence in the city.

#### The Venomous Demesne
This hidden city is ruled by families of tiefling warlocks who wield powerful magic and craft dark wonders. If you're playing a tiefling or a warlock, you could have ties to the Venomous Demesne.

### Aftermath of the Last War
Droaam is barely a decade old. The treaty nations refuse to acknowledge its sovereignty; according to the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, it's a rebellious territory of Breland. As a renegade nation, it is a haven for war criminals and deserters, as well as brigands and mages pursuing forbidden paths of magic. The monsters of Droaam have no particular love for these bandits and fugitives, and outlanders have to watch their step.

Tensions remain high on the border with Breland, resulting in constant skirmishes and raids. Deeper within the nation, the Daughters of Sora Kell build their power. Graywall and the Great Crag are constantly expanding, with goblins and ogres laboring through the night. Warlords drill their troops, forcing all manner of monsters to work together. A predatory aspect permeates life in Droaam but also a sense of excitement, the belief that the Daughters will lead Droaam to greatness. For centuries the people of Droaam have hidden in the shadows; now they stand in the light, and they are proud.

## Eldeen Reaches
**Capital**: Greenheart

**Hallmarks**: Agriculture, animal husbandry, druidic magic

A stretch of fertile farmlands borders a vast, untamed forest. Farmers tend the fields, while tribes of shifters and circles of druids and rangers roam through the woods. These are the Eldeen Reaches.

Druids and shifters dwelled in the Towering Wood for thousands of years, but the eastern farmlands of the Reaches were part of Aundair until the Last War. The lords of Aundair focused their resources on the war effort, ignoring banditry and other problems faced by the farmers of the east. The Wardens of the Wood—largest of the druid sects—came to the aid of these farmers. Fifty years ago, the people of eastern Aundair seceded and formed the Eldeen Reaches. The Treaty of Thronehold recognized the Reaches as a nation, but its citizens fear Aundair will try to reclaim the region.

Druidic magic is central to life in the Eldeen Reaches. Its people seek to live in harmony with the natural world, and each community has a druidic advisor who helps with planning and planting. The Towering Wood is also home to tribes of shifters, who maintain a nomadic existence. The Wardens of the Wood uphold order and settle disputes, and the Great Druid Oalian—an awakened greatpine—is the spiritual leader of the Reaches.

### Interesting Things About the Eldeen Reaches
- The Towering Wood is vast and untamed. The Wardens of the Wood seek to protect travelers, but swathes of forest remain entirely untouched by human or shifter. Such areas could hold giant beasts never seen in the outside world, or relics from a previous age—artifacts or ruins created by demons or the terrifying daelkyr.
- The fey have a strong presence in the Towering Wood. Even outside the fey stronghold of the Twilight Demesne, manifest zones tied to Thelanis (see *chapter 4*) allow passage between worlds. The Eldeen Reaches are a logical origin for a character with ties to the fey.
- Druidic magic is a vital tool in the Eldeen Reaches. Residents use animal messengers to carry communications between villages, and beasts perform vital services. *Goodberry* wine takes the place of House Vadalis healing. Communities include awakened animals and plants as members.

### Eldeen Characters
When creating an Eldeen character or NPC, consider the following:

**Farm or Forest**? Did you grow up on one of the farms of the eastern Reaches, or did you spend your childhood in the Towering Wood? Are you comfortable in buildings, or do you prefer the open air? As a child of the forest, you might take the outlander background, or perhaps you became a folk hero by defending farmers from bandits and beasts.

**Natural Magic**. Druidic traditions play an important role in Eldeen society. If you're a druid or ranger, are you a stoic Warden of the Wood or a grim Child of Winter? Even if you're not a spellcaster, the Magic Initiate feat can provide you with a few spells to reflect a basic initiation into the druidic mysteries.

**A Land with No Lords.** The Reachers are fiercely independent. They broke with Aundair, and they bow to no monarch. The folk of the Reaches value talent over titles. The Eldeen people respect the guidance of the druids, but they all work together to solve their problems; no one gives orders to a Reacher.

### Cities and Sites
Most people of the Eldeen Reaches live in villages and on farms. Some folk in the Towering Wood make their homes in the vast trees, while others are wanderers.

#### The Gloaming
This region of the Towering Wood has strong ties to the sinister Plane of Mabar (see *chapter 4*). It's charged with negative energy, and undead and other malevolent creatures lurk in its shadows.

#### Greenheart
The grove of the Archdruid Oalian, the awakened greatpine, is a place of great primal power. The Wardens of the Wood are based around Greenheart, but all the druid circles of the Eldeen Reaches send emissaries to Greenheart when they have important matters to discuss.

#### The Twilight Demesne
Located within the Towering Wood, the Twilight Demesne has close ties to the Faerie Court of Thelanis (see *chapter 4*). Fey abound in this forest, and those who wander within may stumble upon the City of Rose and Thorn, the domain of a powerful archfey called the King of Summer. If you're playing a character with ties to the fey, the Twilight Demesne could be your home.

#### Varna
The largest city in the Reaches serves as the gateway for commerce with the world beyond. Reacher merchants come from far and wide to sell their goods in the markets of Varna. All the dragonmarked houses have outposts in Varna, but as the ancestral seat of House Vadalis it houses their largest enclave.

![[074-2-06.png|right|300]](Planar Observatory in the Eldeen Reaches)

### Aftermath of the Last War
The farmers of the eastern Eldeen seceded from Aundair during the Last War, and tensions between the two nations remain high. Most Reachers believe it's only a matter of time until Aundair tries to reclaim the region, and every village has a militia ready to serve.

The people of the Reaches value hospitality and regard all people as equals, but the fear of Aundairian aggression can cause Reachers to treat foreigners with suspicion or hostility.

## Karrnath
**Capital**: Korth

**Hallmarks**: Ale, dairy, glass, livestock, lumber, martial discipline, paper, textiles, undead

In a nation of storms and long winters, the grim and stoic Karrns are accustomed to enduring hardship without complaint.

First and foremost, Karrnath is known for its military tradition. Strength, strategy, and discipline are the core values of Karrnath. Karrnath's soldiers might be the finest in Khorvaire, but they lack the magical support of Aundair or Thrane, which evened the odds during the Last War. Nonetheless, Karrns are proud of their martial history, and most are convinced that they would have eventually won the Last War.

Karrnath suffered a series of severe food shortages and plagues early in the Last War. As a result, the king embraced the Blood of Vol as the national religion. The priests of this faith bolstered Karrnath's forces with undead. The current king, Kaius ir'Wynarn III, broke ties with the Blood of Vol and has stopped creating new undead, but Karrnath still has a significant number of skeletons and zombies in service. Many Karrns still believe in the Blood of Vol and approve of the use of undead, but just as many feel that this practice disgraces Karrnath's proud military history and that the necromancers might have been responsible for the famines and plagues.

### Interesting Things About Karrnath

>> ##### The Korranberg Chronicle—In the Thrall of the Vampire King
>>Kaius ir'Wynarn III emerged from the shadows like a villain in one of Kessler's plays. His guardians kept him hidden during his youth while his aunt Moranna served as the regent of Karrnath. So it was a surprise to many when he burst forth to claim his crown and his power, all the more so because of his uncanny resemblance to Kaius I, the ruler who plunged Karrnath into the Last War and instituted the brutal system of laws that bears his name.
>>
>>Given the circumstances of Kaius III's ascension, it's hardly surprising that the new king would face challenges from the proud warlords of Karrnath. Some questioned his lineage and his ability to command. But the most unusual challenge came from the warlord Drago Thul: was Kaius III actually alive? Kaius I had elevated the Blood of Vol in Karrnath and instituted the use of undead as weapons of war. Drago Thul asserted that Kaius III was actually Kaius I, a vampiric monster "seeking to drain the lifeblood of Karrnath itself." This was a serious accusation; the undead have no rights under the Code of Galifar and cannot inherit titles or lands. Thul's challenge spread like wildfire, only to be crushed when Kaius III met the warlords under the midday sun and cut his palm to show his freely flowing blood.
>>
>>This should have been the end of it, but the tale of the Vampire King has proven surprisingly resilient. Some say that the king developed special enchantments to avoid the effects of sunlight; others say that he has relies on changeling impersonators to take his place in the daylight. As for Drago Thul, he refused to stand down when Kaius III pushed for peace and the Treaty of Thronehold. He fled to the city of Stormreach in Xen'drik with a small band of followers, and he continues to rally support against "the monster that sits on our throne."
>>

- Rekkenmark Academy is the premier military institute in Khorvaire; prior to the Last War, all of Galifar's officers trained at Rekkenmark.
- The Sovereign Host has regained its place as the dominant religion of Karrnath, but the Blood of Vol retains a strong following. Communities that practice the faith still use skeletons and zombies as guards or laborers.
- The laws of Karrnath are harsher than those in other treaty nations, approaching a state of martial law.

### Karrnathi Characters
Karrns are somber folk and disapprove of extravagance or excessive shows of emotion. As you develop a Karrnathi character or NPC, consider the following:

**Military Service**. Karrns have a strong tradition of military service, making soldier or sailor appropriate backgrounds for any character. Criminals and charlatans have a difficult time evading the harsh laws of Karrnath. The Martial Adept feat can give a character a strong sense of military experience.

**Martial Tradition**. Karrnathi tradition emphasizes teamwork, focus, and force, and melee warriors prefer heavy armor and weapons. Fighters favor the Champion and Battle Master martial archetypes, and Karrnathi wizards choose the School of Evocation or Necromancy as their arcane tradition.

**The Dead**. Undead soldiers have served in Karrnath's armies for decades. How do you feel about the undead? Are you a follower of the Blood of Vol who considers the undead to be a practical tool? Do you have a relative or friend currently serving? Or do you despise the Blood of Vol and the use of necromancy?

### Cities and Sites
Sturdy walls surround Karrnathi communities, and even the smallest village maintains a capable militia.

#### Atur
Known as the City of Night, Atur is the stronghold of the Blood of Vol in Karrnath. During the war, this was the center for the production of undead, and massive catacombs below the city hold legions of Karrnath's undead soldiers in case they are needed again.

#### Fort Bones
Fortresses such as this one dot the hilltops of Karrnath, watching for signs of enemy encroachment even since the Last War has ended. Fort Bones' garrison consists primarily of Karrnathi undead soldiers. No lights glow here, as these undead rely on darkvision to see.

#### Karrlakton
The turbulent Cyre River separates this city from the deathly Mournland. Karrlakton is the birthplace of kings (both Karrn the Conqueror and Galifar I were born here) and is the center of power for House Deneith. The house's headquarters, Sentinel Tower, dominates the city's skyline. A stern edifice of angular stone, Sentinel Tower radiates martial authority and is one of the most heavily defended fortresses in Khorvaire. Surrounding the tower are training grounds, barracks, and smithies to accommodate all of House Deneith's needs. Sentinel Tower serves as the headquarters of the famed Sentinel Marshals, though most of them are abroad.

#### Korth
The capital of Karrnath is a city-fortress on the edge of the Nightwood and the seat of King Kaius III. Its walls and towers bristle with the weapons of war, and military marches through the city help bolster the spirits of the Karrns as well as intimidate foreign diplomats. The forges of Korth produce some of the finest armor and weapons in Khorvaire.

#### The Nightwood
This massive forest has close ties to the Plane of Mabar. Monsters sometimes slip out of the Nightwood to threaten the surrounding regions. Criminals and fugitives who flee into the Nightwood find the dangers within deadlier than any Karrnathi executioner.

![[075-2-07.png|right|300]](Fort Bones)

### Aftermath of the Last War
Karrnath has always been a martial nation, and its people remain vigilant. Early in the war, King Kaius I instituted the Code of Kaius, a strict set of laws and limits. Karrnath weathered a number of famines during the war, and this privation led to an ongoing program of rationing to ensure that the nation is prepared for whatever lies ahead. The war is over, but the Code of Kaius and the rationing remains in place; the people of Karrnath willingly endure ongoing hardship to ensure that their future is secure. The populace frowns on excess of any sort, accepts limits on luxury items, and approves of swift and harsh punishments for crime.

King Kaius III was one of the architects of the Treaty of Thronehold and remains committed to peace. However, many of the nation's warlords believe that Karrnath would have won the Last War and that Kaius denied the Karrnathi people their rightful destiny. Should these warlords gain sufficient support, they could push for a military coup.

A second destabilizing factor is the tension between the followers of the Blood of Vol and the Karrnathi traditionalists. The Seekers assert that the Blood of Vol saved Karrnath and point to the power of its undead troops. The traditionalists claim that the dark magic of the Seekers caused famines and plagues, crippling Karrnath and forcing it to rely on the undead. The Blood of Vol could back an uprising in Karrnath, or those who wish to drive out the Seekers could trigger a civil war.

## Lhazaar Principalities
**Capital**: Regalport

**Hallmarks**: Fish, mercenaries, merchants, pirates, ships

This loose confederacy of pirate lords, merchant princes, and sea barons holds the northeastern coastline of Khorvaire and the many mist-shrouded islands scattered across it. Recognized as a single allied nation under the Treaty of Thronehold, the principalities are more of a loose alliance. Each island domain has its own values, goals, and feuds with other domains. The Lhazaar are the finest sailors in Khorvaire. During the Last War, they served all nations as privateers and engaged in piracy on the side. When the war ended, they returned to the merchant trade, but pirates still hunt on the open seas.

The Lhazaar value their independence. Here, anyone can rise to captain a ship or even seize a principality. Leadership is earned, not given. Nevertheless, High Prince Ryger ir'Wynarn of Regalport seeks to forge the principalities into a unified force. He has the finest fleet, and his efforts ensured that the principalities gained recognition at Thronehold, after which he awarded himself the title of High Prince. So far, the other princes have rejected his proposals for a stronger union.

Some principalities are devoted to the Blood of Vol and a few favor the Sovereign Host. Beyond these, the Lhazaar show little enthusiasm for religion, though many curse the Devourer when a storm comes.

### Interesting Things About the Lhazaar Principalities
- Rulership of the principalities is so fluid that it's possible for someone to start the day as a sailor and end it as a prince. A campaign could easily be based around a party of adventurers gaining a principality.
- The Wind Whisperer principality includes a number of half-elves with the Mark of Storm—foundlings with no tie to House Lyrandar. The Wind Whisperers want to obtain airships by any means necessary.
- The Lhazaar Principalities have the largest changeling population in Khorvaire. Many of them congregate in the Gray Tide, a domain founded by changelings.

### Lhazaar Characters
As you develop a Lhazaar character or NPC, consider the following:

**Seafarers and Swashbucklers**. Most Lhazaar spend more time at sea than they do on land. Sailor is an appropriate background for any Lhazaar, but you can ask your DM if you can switch a tool proficiency for vehicles (water) proficiency. Lhazaar are flamboyant people with little concern for the law, so charlatan, entertainer, and folk hero are all appropriate backgrounds.

**Local Customs**. Each principality has its own martial traditions, fashions, and slang. Think about how your choices reflect your principality and work with your DM to develop one that fits your character.

**Big Dreams**. Whatever their circumstances, the people of the principalities always look to the future. What do you want? To find a forgotten treasure hoard? To command your own ship? To take your place as a prince? Think big and chase your dreams.

### Cities and Sites
Among the myriad ports and pirate redoubts of the Lhazaar Principalities are ancient ruins from forgotten civilizations that predate even the Dhakaani Empire, as well as tombs built by wealthy pirates and sea lords to house their treasures and earthly remains.

Presented below are a handful of the most widely known—if hard to find—places in the principalities.

#### Dreadhold
This island prison is said to be inescapable. Maintained by House Kundarak, Dreadhold houses a host of infamous criminals and political prisoners. Its vaults also hold some of the greatest treasures of House Kundarak.

#### Port Verge
Port Verge is the royal port of the Direshark Principality. Prince Kolberkon yearns to expand Verge and overshadow Regalport, and he is always looking for capable adventurers and allies. The Blood of Vol has a strong presence in Port Verge, and Kolberkon recently allowed House Lyrandar to establish an enclave there. But Kolberkon's thirst for glory may lead him to foolish bargains.

#### Regalport
The seat of the High Prince Ryger and the Seadragon Principality, Regalport is the grandest city in the principalities. The patriarch of House Thuranni resides in Regalport, and House Ghallanda has a significant outpost here. The Pirate Exchange is the largest market east of the Ironroot Mountains.

#### Trebaz Sinara
It's said that the legendary pirate queen Lhazaar made her home on Trebaz Sinara, and that this island holds the treasures and tombs of generations of sea lords. However, the island hasn't been seen in over five hundred years. Many Lhazaar sailors have devoted their lives to finding the legendary lost isle.

### Aftermath of the Last War
During the Last War, the Lhazaar served as privateers and pirates. Outsiders wonder if the principalities can adapt to peace, or if their thirst for gold and adventure will lead their subjects to ruin.

Most of the princes are content with their domains, but ambitious rulers such as Prince Ryger of Regalport and Prince Kolberkon of Port Verge could shatter the status quo. Kolberkon seeks to expand his personal power, while Ryger wants to forge a stronger unified nation. Both pursue dangerous alliances in their campaigns. In addition to agreements with the dragonmarked houses, rumors abound of bargains with dragons, fiends, and the distant Empire of Riedra. Will the dreams of these princes lead to a new war?

## Mror Holds
**Capital**: Krona Peak

**Hallmarks**: Banking, dwarves, metalwork, mining (precious and non-precious metals)

When humanity first came to Khorvaire, they found the dwarven clans of the Mror Holds locked in endless feuds. This division kept the clans from uniting against the new arrivals, and the dwarves were forced to swear fealty to Karrnath and Galifar. Over the centuries, they turned their energies to harnessing the astonishing natural resources of their mountain home. The dwarves were then reborn as merchant lords.

![[076-2-08.png|right|300]]

In the early days of the Last War, Mror miners made an astonishing discovery: the ruins of an ancient dwarven empire, vast halls deep within the Ironroot Mountains. Explorers uncovered mines still brimming with jewels and precious ores and vaults filled with riches and powerful artifacts. The Mror restored these ancient fortresses and worked to reclaim the secrets of their ancestors. Seeing the untapped potential of the Realm Below and the broken Kingdom of Galifar, the clan lords joined together to form the Iron Council and to declare the independence and sovereignty of the Mror Holds.

One question remained: What had become of the ancient dwarves? The answer soon became apparent. As the Mror delved deeper into the Realm Below, they woke an ancient evil: **Dyrrn** the Corruptor, a daelkyr lord of madness. Hordes of aberrations and derro rose from the depths to challenge the explorers. For decades, the Mror lords have been fighting a battle in the depths, struggling to drive the darkness from their ancestral halls. Many dwarves revile anything to do with the daelkyr. Others believe that the daelkyr can grant the Mror dwarves the power to overcome any enemy. Some clans have taken up symbionts and living weapons recovered from the depths, and cabals of warlocks draw on the power of the Plane of Xoriat (see *chapter 4*).

The Mror Holds consist of a loose confederation. Twelve noble clans each govern a hold and have a representative on the Iron Council, which resolves disputes and issues affecting the entire nation. Each hold includes a number of lesser clans, who owe fealty to the noble line. Those who occupy land above have the right to claim the halls that lie below if they can.

The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of the Mror Holds. Kol Korran is the most beloved of the Sovereigns, but the dwarves also revere Boldrei, Dol Dorn, Olladra, and Onatar.

### Interesting Things About the Mror Holds
- The Mror Holds contain deep reserves of gold, silver, and other rare and precious metals, along with iron and other ores. The Mror dwarves are skilled miners and artisans.
- A clan of orcs called the Jhorash'tar live among the Ironroot Mountains. The Jhorash'tar have been slowly crowded into the least hospitable regions of the mountains. A few dwarven clans seek to incorporate the Jhorash'tar into Mror society, but others wish to drive them out once and for all.
- The dwarves have recovered artifacts and arcane secrets from the Realm Below. Dwarf artificers are still working to master the techniques of their ancestors, while warlocks strive to harness the powers of the daelkyr. Mror communities are shaped by the artifacts they possess or by their interactions with the daelkyr. A Mror lord might serve guests from a bottomless cauldron of wine, while another studies strangers using a crown of eyes, claiming that this living artifact reveals all evil intent.

### Mror Characters
As you develop a Mror character or NPC, consider the following:

**Clan Focus**. The dwarf clan is the heart of Mror culture. Is your clan known for mercantile power or martial skill? Are you a noble—even if you're a few steps removed from true power? Or are you a guild artisan or soldier? Most Mror have embraced modern martial techniques, but a few minor clans still cling to barbarian traditions of the past. What caused you to leave your hold? Are you serving your clan and honing your skills, or have you been exiled from your homeland?

**The Realm Below**. How has the Realm Below affected your family and your character? Do you oppose the foul forces that infest your ancestral halls, or do you see them as a source of power? You might be a paladin sworn to oppose the horrors that dwell in the deep, or you could be a warlock who's forged a pact with a Great Old One patron, one of the dark powers in the depths.

**Pride in Possessions**. From the wealthiest clan lord to the humblest miner, the Mror take great pride in their possessions. Quality is more important than appearance, and you are interested in the history of the items you carry. If you find a magic weapon, you want to know the battles it has seen and the warriors who have wielded it before you. This is especially true of the relics recovered from the Realm Below. Who forged the blade you carry? Do you bear a trinket from a forgotten age?

### Cities and Sites

>> ##### The Voice of Karrnath—Mror Holds: Birthplace of abomination!
>>It's been exactly seventy years since the Iron Council declared the Mror Holds' independence from Karrnath. King Kaius II was newly seated on the steel throne and lacked the resolve to bring the dwarf lords to heel. Now we see the harvest we have sown, and it is horrifying. Without the firm hand of Karrnath to keep them on a righteous path, the Mror dwarves have embraced foul powers.
>>
>>Witness Lord Malus Soldorak, seen in Korth this week for trade negotiations. His breastplate was forged from chitin and muscle, and it seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat. A guard present at the event said that Soldorak's axe moaned when the blade came close to him, as if the weapon hungered for human blood.
>>
>>This is what springs from our mercy and forbearance. Who knows what horrors the dwarves are crafting—or breeding—in their mountain halls? We cannot stand by and let this vileness continue. For the good of our nation, we call on all true Karrns to demand that Regent Moranna unleash our full might on the Mror Holds and cleanse this horror!
>>

The Mror Holds spread across the Ironroot Mountains. Most Mror communities are at least partially subterranean, extending down into the mountains. The Realm Below is deep beneath the surface, and not every town has a passage to it.

#### Krona Peak
Located in the dwarven realm of Mroranonhold, Krona Peak serves as the seat of the Iron Council and thus is the Mror Holds' equivalent of a capital. This center of commerce provides a major connection to the western nations. Kol Korran's Throne, Khorvaire's largest temple to the Sovereign Lord of World and Wealth, dominates the cityscape.

#### Solangap
The holdfast of Clan Soldorak, Solangap boasts vast gold mines and the largest mint and treasury in Khorvaire. Clan Soldorak has recovered many daelkyr tools and weapons from the Realm Below. Solan lords proudly wear symbionts and make no effort to hide their warlock pacts.

#### Noldrunhold
Four hundred years ago, the dwarves of Clan Noldrun vanished. All expeditions that delved into Noldrunhold ended in disaster, and the region was declared to be cursed and shunned. At the time, the dwarves believed that the Jhorash'tar orcs were responsible, but now it seems more likely that the Noldrun opened a path to the Realm Below. What malevolent powers have claimed the halls of Noldrunhold?

#### The Realm Below
No one knows the extent or depth of the ancient dwarven empire deep beneath the Ironroot Mountains. Great wealth and arcane secrets remain hidden in these halls, along with endless hordes of aberrations. As a Mror adventurer, you could help your family reclaim lands from the Realm Below, or you could lead your allies into the deep in search of wealth and glory.

### Aftermath of the Last War
The Mror Holds declared independence during the Last War. Many nations depend on the resource of the Holds, and the Treaty of Thronehold affirmed its sovereignty.

To the casual observer, the Mror dwarves' star appears to be rising. Their mines seem to offer limitless resources. Mror artificers make amazing strides as they study the relics of their ancestors. The dwarves are proud of their ancient past and optimistic about the future. Most Mror are generous and courageous, eager to show off their wealth and accomplishments.

Those who dig deeper realize that this prosperity is built on an unstable foundation. The Last War may be over, but the war against the daelkyr has barely begun. The clan lords hold their reclaimed halls in the Realm Below, but no one knows the full extent of the power of the daelkyr. A renewed assault could come at any time, whether it's a force of monsters boiling up from below or a creeping madness that infects the weak-willed.

The dwarves are also divided by their attitude toward the aberrations. Some of the clans—notably Soldorak—embrace symbionts and other daelkyr gifts; some even experiment with flesh-warping techniques and create their own monsters. Others—notably Clan Mroranon—avoid contact with the aberrations. Such dwarves treasure the relics of their ancestors but despise those who use symbionts or form pacts with the darkness.

Long ago, the dwarves engaged in vicious feuds that kept them from uniting as a nation. This new divide could reignite those rivalries, leading to a civil war on the surface even as evil gains strength in the depths.

![[077-2-09.png|right|300]]

## Q'barra
**Capital**: Newthrone

**Hallmarks**: Eberron dragonshards, rare herbs

Q'barra is a young nation on the edge of Khorvaire, an untamed frontier filled with danger and opportunity. During the golden age of Galifar, few humans bothered to cross the Endworld Mountains to explore the vast jungle beyond. When the Last War broke out, a fleet of settlers came to Q'barra in search of a new home far from the war. As this settlement expanded, the settlers discovered massive deposits of Eberron dragonshards (see *chapter 5*). Over the past decade, a wave of prospectors, wandslingers, refugees, and fortune-seekers have descended on Q'barra, along with brigands, deserters from the war, and all manner of criminals and opportunists.

To their surprise, Q'barra was already home to a number of ancient civilizations humans know nothing about: the lizardfolk of the Cold Sun Federation, the dragonborn of Ka'rhashan, and the confederacy of the Poison Dusk lizardfolk. Most settlers refer to them collectively as "scales." King Sebastes ir'Kesslan of Newthrone has established a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, but communication has been difficult and prospectors rarely abide by the terms of the treaty.

### Interesting Things About Q'barra
- Q'barra is one of the richest sources of Eberron dragonshards in Khorvaire, drawing waves of settlers and prospectors to this young and growing nation on the edge of civilization.
- Certain ruins in Q'barra appear connected to the Age of Demons. The settlers know little of the history of this region, but the Poison Dusk lizardfolk have ties to fiendish powers.
- House Tharashk has a strong presence in Q'barra. Tharashk is the primary buyer of Eberron dragonshards and also runs large-scale mining operations here.

### Q'barran Characters
Q'barra tempts explorers from the west with the prospects of wealth and new lands to conquer—mostly humans but including members of all races found in Khorvaire. Settlers, dragonborn, and lizardfolk characters who originate here should consider the following:

**Settlers**. Q'barra is an excellent place to explore the traditional archetypes of the classic Western. As a paladin, you could be a lone sheriff seeking to protect your newly formed mining village. Your cleric could be the town preacher. As a sorcerer or bard with a criminal background, you could be a dashing wandslinger looking for trouble and gold.

**Renegades and Regrets**. Q'barra promises a land of opportunity and a place where you can leave your past behind. Are you a deserter? Were you convicted of a crime you didn't commit? Are you fleeing from a broken heart? Q'barra has also drawn Cyran refugees and newly freed warforged, both seeking a home in the wild east.

**Lizardfolk**. The lizardfolk's primitive culture blends druidic traditions with the beliefs of the Silver Flame. You might have been sent to study the softskins—to learn about them and potentially serve as an envoy for your people. Alternatively, you could be following a spiritual vision.

**Dragonborn**. The dragonborn live amid the remnants of ancient glory. They have a proud martial tradition, and a number of dragonborn venture west in search of worthy challenges. If you follow this path, you might have served as a mercenary in the Last War.

### Cities and Sites
Q'barra is split into three main regions. New Galifar is the original colony; it has a feudal structure and holds to the laws of the Treaty of Thronehold. To the north, Hope is a collection of small mining towns. In Hope, the law goes only as far as the people willing to enforce it. Beyond these human regions lie the unexplored lands of the scales.

#### Haka'torvhak
Explorers tell stories of a city hidden deep in the jungles of Q'barra—a wondrous citadel of obsidian and brass. According to these tales, the city is filled with treasure and guarded by a dragon fused with an ancient demon.

#### Newthrone
The capital of New Galifar and the seat of King Sebastes, Newthrone is the largest city and port in Q'barra. Myriad people from all over Khorvaire mingle here in crowded streets. Soldiers pay little heed to the rampant crime in these streets, viewing it instead as part of life in the port city.

#### Wyrmwatch
A thriving prospecting town in Hope, Wyrmwatch was established by Cyran refugees. Although far smaller than New Cyre in Breland, its people are proud of what they have built. The independent community is led by Elder Nevillom, a veteran and evangelist of the Silver Flame. Nevillom's courage and passionate sermons help sustain the people of Wyrmwatch in difficult times.

### Aftermath of the Last War
The influx of Cyran refugees promises to reshape Q'barra. Most of the settlers are peaceful people searching for a homes and opportunities, but some among them chose Q'barra over refugee camps because they refused to accept charity from former enemies. These "Mourners" rob and kill settlers from the nations that fought against Cyre. Hope also has its share of brigands and criminals, bandits who prey on House Tharashk convoys and settlers alike.

The relationship between the settlers and the natives is another source of tension. Although King Sebastes forged a treaty with the Cold Sun Federation, the prospectors of Hope regularly violate this treaty. The Poison Dusk lizardfolk are hostile to both the settlers and the Cold Sun Federation. Conflicts between settlers and scales have escalated over the last four years, and many fear that worse is yet to come.

## Shadow Marches
**Capital**: Zarash'ak (unofficial)

**Hallmarks**: Eberron dragonshards, herbs

When most people think of the Shadow Marches, they imagine a fetid backwater where illiterate humans mingle with orcs and other foul creatures, practicing strange rites by the light of the moons. While flawed, this vision isn't entirely inaccurate. The Shadow Marches are a desolate land of swamps and moors. The homeland of the orcs, the Marches were scarred in the ancient conflict with the daelkyr. The fiends left twisted creatures and aberrations in the swamps, and sowed seeds of madness that linger to this day. There are indeed moonlit rituals in the Marches: some to honor the daelkyr, others to maintain the wards that keep them trapped in Khyber.

Humans came to the Marches long ago, refugees fleeing a war in the distant land of Sarlona. Over time the two cultures merged, forming the Marches as they exist today.

The Marches had little contact with the Kingdom of Galifar or the east until a few hundred years ago, when a House Sivis expedition made two discoveries: the region contained valuable dragonshards, and a number of clans had manifested the Dragonmark of Finding. This led to the foundation of House Tharashk, as these clans joined together to master the economic potential of their mark and leverage their mineral wealth.

The Shadow Marches aren't a nation. No one voice speaks for the clans and tribes, and most of the tribes have no interest in dealing with outsiders. House Tharashk is the largest faction in the region, and their city of Zarash'ak is the center for commerce.

House Tharashk is the main point of contact between the Shadow Marches and the outside world. Tharashk aside, the region remains a collection of tribes and cultists following their ancient traditions in the shadows of the swamps.

### Interesting Things About the Shadow Marches
- The untamed Shadow Marches are filled with mysteries. Relics of the daelkyr rest undisturbed in the depths of the swamps, along with foul monsters and druidic shrines.
- The Marches are the birthplace of the druidic tradition of the Gatekeepers. Long ago, this sect defeated the vile daelkyr; today, its last champions continue to protect Eberron from aberrations and other extraplanar threats.
- Even in defeat, the daelkyr sowed seeds of madness in the Marches. Followers of the Cults of the Dragon Below remain scattered across the region. Some of these cults work with mind flayers and other aberrations. Others have no evil intent but are driven by dangerous delusions.

### Marcher Characters
As you develop a Marcher character or NPC, consider the following:

**The Mark of Finding.** An alliance of Marcher clans formed House Tharashk, but not all those who carried the mark chose to join this house. As a half-orc with the Mark of Finding, you could be a child of the Marches with a strong tie to the house, or you could be a scion of a small tribe of hunters, proud of your independence and suspicious of the houses. Your ties to the Marches might be distant because you were born to a family that left years ago. Do you want to rediscover your ancestral roots?

**Madness and Mysticism**. Most Marchers have a mystical view of the world, beliefs shaped by the traditions of the Gatekeepers and the madness of the daelkyr. Marchers typically feel that the people of the treaty nations are blinded by their civilized ways. You have heard the truth in the voices of croaking frogs and seen it in the shadows shifting on the water. Whether you're loyal to the Gatekeepers, the Sovereign Host, or the Dragon Below, superstitions inform your path.

**Clan or Tribe**? The people of the Shadow Marches are split into two distinct cultures. The clans blend the traditions of human and orc, building towns and working with steel. If you were raised in one of the clans, the ways of civilization aren't that strange to you; you've seen the city of Zarash'ak and worked with House Tharashk. By contrast, the Marcher tribes maintain traditions that predate humanity. As nomadic hunter-gatherers, they don't work metals; they make their tools from stone, hide, wood, and bone. If your character is from one of the Marcher tribes, you might be the first of your people to leave the swamps. Why have you left your people, and how are you adapting to this new world?

### Cities and Sites
The clans of the Shadow Marches primarily live in small towns and villages, their huts raised above the swamps on stilts. The Shadow Marches contain many manifest zones tied to Xoriat and Kythri (see *chapter 4* for descriptions of both), the planes of madness and chaos. Time moves strangely in places in the deep swamps, which twists mundane beasts and plants into strange shapes. Daelkyr ruins linger in these areas, remnants of the ancient war against the goblins and orcs that once dominated Khorvaire.

#### Dragonshard Fields
The Shadow Marches hold deposits of Eberron dragonshards, the source of House Tharashk's wealth. These fields aren't as rich as those in Q'barra, but there's gold to be made by those willing to hunt for shards in the dangerous swamps.

#### Vvaraak's Cave
The green dragon Vvaraak is said to have taught the secrets of druidic magic to the first Gatekeepers thousands of years ago. Though Vvaraak is long dead, rumors say that her hidden lair holds secrets tied to the Draconic Prophecy and the mysteries of druidic magic.

#### Zarash'ak
Because overland travel through Droaam or the Eldeen Reaches can be extremely dangerous, most people who need to do business in the Marches travel by ship to the port city of Zarash'ak. Built on stilts and known for its cuisine and music, Zarash'ak offers the rare exports of the land without the difficulty of navigating the swamps. House Tharashk oversees the City of Stilts, but Marcher clans and tribes come here to sell crafts and other goods or to celebrate religious rituals.

### Aftermath of the Last War
The Shadow Marches aren't a nation, and the region wasn't recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold. Most Marchers have little interest in the outside world. Marcher tribes don't know the names or number of the nations beyond the swamps, let alone that they were at war. However, as House Tharashk gains power and influence in the world beyond the swamps, it has increased its presence in its homeland. The house has expanded Zarash'ak dramatically over the last decade and is working on transforming other towns into cities. This has caused tension with a number of tribes. And House Tharashk's mining operations and its urban expansion always run the risk of disrupting Gatekeeper seals and unleashing ancient evils bound beneath the Marches.

## Talenta Plains
**Capital**: Gatherhold

**Hallmarks**: Dinosaurs, halflings, livestock

The halflings of the Talenta Plains have no cities and no industrialized magic, but they do have dinosaurs. The halflings domesticated the dinosaurs of the plains and use these creatures as mounts, livestock, and beasts of burden. A sacred bond exists between a hunter and mount, and few people are prepared to face a raging halfling barbarian riding a furious clawfoot raptor.

Talenta religion reveres spirits, both departed ancestors and natural spirits. Each tribe has a lath—a chieftain who guides the tribe—and shamans who consult the spirits and choose the paths of migration.

In the past, the tribes stood alone, but during the Last War, many halflings came together under Lathon Halpum to defend their land. Halpum won recognition for the Plains as one of the Thronehold nations, though it's still unclear what this means beyond increasing passage between the Plains and the outside world.

### Interesting Things About the Talenta Plains
- House Ghallanda and House Jorasco both originated in the Talenta Plains. The dragonmarked bloodlines appear throughout the tribes, though you can play a dragonmarked halfling from the Plains who doesn't work for the houses.
- The Talentan reverence for spirits derives from the fact that a variety of spirits haunt the Plains. The region contains an unusual number of manifest zones tied to Dolurrh and Thelanis (see *chapter 4* for descriptions of both). Ghosts are more likely to linger in such places, and minor fey are scattered across the Plains.
- Stories tell of ancient ruins that date back to the first age of the world and of a vast graveyard holding the bones of dragons.

![[078-2-10.png|right|300]]

### Talentan Characters
See chapter 1 for quirks and other features relevant to halfling characters from the Talenta Plains. Also consider the following:

**Wild Warriors and Tricksters.** You were born in the wild, and your wits and your weapons helped you survive. Talenta warriors are often barbarians or rangers, relying on speed and skill. Outlander is a logical background, but you could easily be a folk hero, entertainer, or charlatan. You could even be an urchin who was stranded in a great city and adapted to life there.

**Surrounded by Spirits**. Fey, fiends, and the ghosts of ancestors, these are all part of the spirit world, and they're all around you. Do you believe that the spirits guide your actions? Do you show respect to the spirits of a location? Talentan shamans tend to be druids of the Circle of the Moon or the Circle of the Shepherd (from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*), often assuming the form of dinosaurs. You could also reflect a strong bond to spirits by playing a warlock with an Archfey patron, a cleric with the Nature domain, a paladin sworn to the Oath of the Ancients, or a barbarian on the Path of the Totem Warrior or Path of the Ancestral Guardian (from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*). Hermit and outlander are natural backgrounds, but you could be an acolyte or a sage who consults spirits instead of books. Warriors and shamans both wear masks to present a particular face to the spirit world.

**Dinosaurs**. Talenta halflings have a close bond to their dinosaur companions. If you don't begin the campaign with a dinosaur mount or companion, you might acquire one over the course of your adventures. You can also consider whether a fallen dinosaur is part of your backstory; perhaps you lost your faithful mount in the Last War, but you believe its spirit is still with you.

### Cities and Sites
The Talenta Plains have been described as an ocean of grasslands. The nomadic halflings have little interest in building towns; most shelter in the Talenta Plains is temporary. Halflings shun the ruins scattered across the Plains, believing them to be haunted by fiends.

#### Gatherhold
All the halfling tribes come to Gatherhold to trade, hold councils, and settle disputes. House Ghallanda maintains the town, but Gatherhold belongs to the people, not the houses. Other dragonmarked houses offer their services here as well. The town is on the shore of Lake Cyre, and once people came by boat through Cyre; now the Mourning has cut off that passage.

#### The Wandering Inn
This caravan maintained by members of House Ghallanda is a traveling fair, providing entertainment and shelter to any fortunate enough to cross its path. When times are dark and travelers are weary, one can always hope that the Wandering Inn is just beyond the horizon.

### Aftermath of the Last War
The halfling tribes joined together to defend themselves from outsiders, and the Talenta Plains were recognized as a nation under the Treaty of Thronehold. Now that the war is over, most of the tribes have returned to their hunting grounds and ancient traditions. They united to defend their way of life, and now they wish to enjoy it.

But the halflings don't yet know if it's possible to return to the previous ways. More foreigners visit the Plains than at any time in the past. Settlers and merchants cross the Plains as they make their way to Q'barra, and they clash with Q'barran bandits. The Valenar elves ride through the Plains in search of adventure. Monsters emerge from the Mournland. Dragonmarked houses seek to expand their role at Gatherhold and to explore the untapped resources of the Plains.

The halflings have no interest in change, but it might be inevitable. Lathon Halpum believes that if the tribes can work together, they could become a nation of nations, but others aggressively oppose such a path. Holy Uldra is a powerful shaman and the leader of her own tribe. She urges halfling warriors to join together for a single purpose: to drive all outsiders from the Plains and to maintain the ancient traditions. The halflings must decide whether the tribes will choose the path of peace or return to war.

## Thrane
**Capital**: Flamekeep

**Hallmarks**: Divine magic, fine crafts, fruit, livestock, the Silver Flame, textiles, wool

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—I was scorched by the Silver Flame!
>>Growing up on the streets of the Callestan district in Sharn, I learned not to put my faith in anything I couldn't see or hold. I think that's why my editor sent me to Flamekeep to cover the Ascension; surely I'd see clearly, with eyes untouched by faith. I thought so, too. But then I found myself in the Chamber of Tira's Sacrifice, a pillar of silver fire marking the spot where one woman gave her life to protect countless innocents. I saw people from all nations joined together in song, celebrating both that ancient sacrifice and the end of our current war. And looking into the innocent eyes of the child priestess, I truly heard the words of that song for the first time: a call for all of us to be better than we are, to protect those in need, to remember that we are all one people in the light of the Silver Flame.
>>

The modern Church of the Silver Flame was founded in Thrane, and most of the people of the nation follow this faith. During the Last War, the people of Thrane chose to set aside the rule of the monarchy and to embrace the leadership of the church. For the last seventy years, Thrane has been a theocracy. The head of the state is 11-year-old Jaela Daran, the divinely selected Keeper of the Flame. Jaela depends on the Council of Cardinals to perform the practical work of running the nation.

The primary purpose of the Silver Flame is to defend the innocent from supernatural evil. The church has always had a militant aspect, with battalions of templars and peasant militias prepared to face undead, lycanthropes, or other monstrous threats. But compassion and charity are core values of the church, and the templars are tasked to defend all innocents. Even during the Last War, if a fiendish threat arose in a Brelish village, Thrane templars would ally with the locals to bring an end to the threat. Not all Thranes rise to this ideal. Zealous Thranes believe the church is destined to reunite Galifar under the Silver Flame, and corrupt priests are interested only in power and wealth.

Not all priests are clerics, and the typical templar is a mundane warrior. However, due to the deep faith of its people, Thrane produces more clerics and paladins than any other nation in Khorvaire.

### Interesting Things About Thrane
- Faith is part of daily life in Thrane, and divine adepts provide important services. Magic is also common in Thrane. *Everbright lanterns* light the streets while magewrights and wizards practice their trades, though there are fewer of them than in other nations.
- Every town has a militia ready to deal with supernatural threats, and people stand together to fight darkness. Champions of the light find support and hospitality, but any character who dabbles with dark forces—necromancers, warlocks, and the like—finds Thrane a dangerous, unwelcoming place.
- The feudal system of nobility remains in place, but ultimate authority rests in the hands of the church. Queen Diani ir'Wynarn is the "blood regent," serving as a symbolic advisor to the Keeper of the Flame. A small fraction of the population would like to see the traditional monarchy restored to power.

### Thrane Characters
As you develop a Thrane character, consider the following details:

**The Impact of Faith.** If you want to reflect a close bond to the Silver Flame, you could gain a few divine spells by taking the Magic Initiate feat. Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, so as a martial Thrane you might focus on archery-related combat styles or take the Sharpshooter feat. Any Thrane could take the acolyte background to reflect a strong connection to the church or the soldier background based on service with the templars.

**Church or Crown**? Do you support the theocracy, or would you like to see power restored to the throne? Many people of faith believe that miring the church in politics distracts it and invites corruption.

**Dealing with Darkness**. The Shadow in the Flame can tempt even the most virtuous soul. How do you react when you encounter corruption and greed? Are you a compassionate person who seeks to lead people to the light, or a zealot determined to crush all darkness?

![[079-2-11.png|right|300]](Cathedral of the Silver Flame)

### Cities and Sites
The Church of the Silver Flame is a militant faith, and Thrane communities are built around fortified churches designed to serve as fortresses in times of trouble. Larger towns maintain sturdy walls patrolled by skilled archers. A Flamic architectural style appears throughout the region. Buildings incorporate light and soaring spaces, and icons of the Silver Flame and images of the martyr Tira Miron appear throughout the nation.

#### Flamekeep
The spiritual heart and capital of Thrane, Flamekeep is a massive fortress city. The Keeper of the Flame dwells in the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame, which holds the pillar of fire born when Tira Miron sacrificed herself to bind the demon Bel Shalor. The cathedral is the seat of the Council of Cardinals and the primary garrison of the templar order. Flamekeep is also home to Thalingard, the ancestral palace of the rulers of Thrane and current residence of Queen Diani ir'Wynarn.

#### Shadukar
Shadukar is a grim reminder of the cost of the war. Once known as the Jewel of the Sound, this coastal city was destroyed in a bitter siege against Karrnathi forces. The city has yet to be reclaimed, and it's said to be haunted both by Thrane ghosts and by undead forces left behind by the Karrns.

#### Thaliost
An ancient Aundairian city seized during the Last War, Thaliost was ceded to Thrane under the Treaty of Thronehold. Many of its people bitterly oppose the Thrane occupation, but it's also become a haven for Aundairian followers of the extremist Pure Flame sect; violence often breaks out between these two factions.

### Aftermath of the Last War
The war is over, but deep rifts remain between Thrane and its neighbors. Aundairian war magic created a blasted wasteland between the two nations. To the east, the conflict with Karrnath left farms and cities such as Shadukar devastated and abandoned, home only to the lingering undead left behind after the Karrnathi retreat.

For most, these grim reminders of war strengthen Thrane resolve. The common people are united by their faith and sure of the righteousness of their cause. The Silver Flame urges people to stand together in the face of evil, and across the nation, villagers work together to repair the damage inflicted during the war. People in a Thrane village regularly cooperate to raise a barn or practice archery in the fields.

The Silver Flame urges its followers to feel compassion for all people, which often proves a more difficult challenge. Thrane has never forgiven Karrnath for its use of undead soldiers, and many Thranes are quick to imagine all Karrns as agents of darkness. Likewise, Thranes have bitter memories of the conflict with Aundair, and Aundairian wizards or eldritch knights receive a cold reception.

For most Thranes, the war strengthened their faith and drew them together. However, some question the validity of theocratic rule. Such doubt can be found even among the most devout followers of the faith; such people fear that the merging of temporal and spiritual authority distracts the church from its proper mission. If these doubts spread, a serious faction might seek to restore Queen Diani to power.

Thaliost is another open wound. The Council of Cardinals is determined to hold onto this prize, but it is a bitter point of contention with Aundair and a constant source of tension and violence. In creating a Thrane character, consider how you feel about Thaliost. Would you like to see it returned to Aundair, or do you support Thrane's rule?

## Thronehold
**Capital**: Throneport

**Hallmarks**: Entertainers, international intrigue, spies

After forging a united kingdom, Galifar I realized early on that the crown could not rule from one of the existing realms. To do so would be to put one of the Five Nations above the others, and that would lead to breaks and fractures that would eventually destroy the kingdom. Thus, he established his seat of power on an island in Scions Sound. There he built the great castle of Thronehold.

After Jarot's death and the rejection of the line of succession that led to the Last War, the island and castle were largely abandoned. A special detachment of House Deneith guards, the Throne Wardens, remained in place to protect the castle, but all government functions ceased with the collapse of the Kingdom of Galifar.

Throneport, a town in the shadow of the castle, became a place for dissidents, criminals, spies, and mercenaries, and the once safe port turned into a rough-and-tumble town without allegiance to any single nation.

### Interesting Things About Thronehold
- Representatives (and spies) of the Five Nations gather in the town of Throneport, where it's impossible to tell friend from foe and alliances shift daily.
- Although Cyre no longer has a peacekeeping force on the island, many Cyrans find work here as spies and agents for other nations.

### Thronehold Characters
As you develop a character or NPC from Thronehold, consider the following:

**Cold Warriors**. Thronehold is a gladiatorial arena for diplomats and spies, a dangerous playground for bored nobles, and a haven for treacherous double agents. Characters with the charlatan, spy, noble, or criminal background might all test their skills here.

**Play It Again**. If diplomats and spies have one thing in common, it's a weakness for pleasant distractions. When not playing their games of deceit, they seek out the best entertainment and companionship the island has to offer. Characters with the entertainer background can make many untrustworthy friends here.

![[080-2-12.png|right|300]]

### Aftermath of the Last War
By 975 YK, Throneport had grown into a small city in which all of the nations and dragonmarked houses had at least a small presence, turning it into a hotbed of international intrigue. The Treaty of Thronehold further solidified Throneport as a multinational capital under the control of small peacekeeping forces from Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, and Thrane, with House Deneith Throne Wardens in place to make sure the terms of the treaty are honored. Today, the small city is neutral ground, but the castle and its grounds remain off limits and under the watchful protection of the wardens.

## Valenar
**Capital**: Taer Valaestas

**Hallmarks**: Elves, horses, mercenaries

In the midst of the Last War, an army of Tairnadal warrior elves from Aerenal seized this region from Cyre, invoking a claim to the land from long before humanity's arrival on the continent. The elves of Valenar devote themselves to the arts of war. Their cavalry has no equal in Khorvaire, and they combine a talent for magic with stealth and swordplay. Cyre employed the Valenar as mercenaries until the elves betrayed Cyre and took a corner of the nation for themselves. These lands escaped the destruction visited upon the rest of Cyre. After the Mourning, no one wanted to challenge the Valenar's claim to the land they had taken; in the interests of peace, the Treaty of Thronehold recognized the new elf kingdom of Valenar.

Valenar elves spend little time at rest, operating in small units called warbands. Those who aren't patrolling the kingdom travel abroad seeking adventure. Half-elves handle the civic administration. Some of these are the children of Valenar elves, but most are immigrants who've come from elsewhere in Khorvaire in search of opportunity. Cyran humans still occupying the region fall below them in rank. Once citizens of Cyre, now they're citizens of Valenar. Little has changed for the commoners, most of whom don't care who wears the crown.

The harsh sands of the Blade Desert cover northern Valenar and serve as a natural barrier between this land and the rest of Khorvaire. Beyond the desert, Valenar transitions from rolling steppes to fertile plains. The desert can be deadly, but the Valenar elves pose the greatest risk for adventurers. The elves won't interfere with peaceful caravans, but a well-armed group of travelers invites challenges.

### Interesting Things About Valenar
- The dragonmarked House Lyrandar helped the Valenar elves build the infrastructure of their kingdom. The half-elves have no homeland, but House Lyrandar hopes to make Valenar a haven for its people.
- The ancestors of the elves fought goblins for control of this region many thousands of years ago. Relics of that struggle are still scattered across Valenar and the Blade Desert: ruins, haunted fortresses, and battlefields that have slipped out of alignment with time.
- Valenar warbands include druids and rangers, and druidic magic bolsters the military arsenal of the elves. Walls of thorns surround elven fortresses, and beasts fight alongside the elves. Valenar horses are known for being as fearless and stubborn as the elves who ride them.

### Valenar Characters
See chapter 1 for additional information about creating Valenar elves. When creating a Valenar character or NPC, consider the following:

**Martial Role**. Valenar was forged in war. As an elf, consider your role in a warband. Are you a simple soldier, an acolyte devoted to the elven ancestors, or a sage familiar with your Valenar history? As a half-elf, you might be an entertainer, a sailor, or a guild artisan working to support the elf army, or you might be a charlatan seeking opportunities. As a human from Valenar, you could be an urchin born in Taer Valaestas, or a folk hero fighting for the common people.

**Dreams**. Have you left Valenar behind, or are your aspirations tied to the new kingdom? As a half-elf with Valenar blood, do you want to be recognized as a true Valenar—granted a bond to a patron ancestor and a chance at immortality—or are you more interested in building a homeland for your people? As a human whose land the elves reclaimed, do you want to work with the elves or do you want to drive them out—and if so, who do you want to replace them?

**Animal Companions**. Feytouched beasts play an important role in Valenar society. The Valenar are known for their steeds, but a wide range of Valenar beasts bond with non-elves. As a starting character, you might not have established a connection to a Valenar beast. If you return to Valenar later in your adventuring career, perhaps you will find your bondmate.

### Cities and Sites
Most of the communities of Valenar consist of farming villages, with fortress towers scattered across the plains as military outposts.

#### Moonshadow
A peaceful Khoravar village built on the Old Road, Moonshadow is a young community, built by immigrants who hope that Valenar can become a home for their people. Though small, Moonshadow has drawn half-elves from across Khorvaire, and a surprising number of gifted scholars and artisans thrive in the village.

#### Pylas Maradal
The second largest city in Valenar, Pylas Maradal is a port on the southern coast. House Lyrandar has invested in the city and built shipyards and a large house enclave. The port sees traffic from Q'barra, Sarlona, and Aerenal. When the region was part of Cyre, this city was known as Southport, a haven for smugglers and pirates.

#### Taer Valaestas
High King Shaeras Vadallia maintains his seat in Taer Valaestas. Located in the center of the kingdom, the city is built for war and surrounded by a living wall of bronzewood thorns. In addition to the royal palace, outposts of most dragonmarked houses, and a market where foreigners sell their wares, Taer Valaestas hosts the primary temple of the Keepers of the Past and a vast arena used for horse training, races, and other displays of equestrian skill.

### Aftermath of the Last War
There's a popular saying in Taer Valaestas: "The shadow of war hangs long over Valenar." War defines Valenar culture. The Treaty of Thronehold recognized Valenar as a sovereign nation, but the elves are already pushing the limits of the treaty. Some venture into the Mournland or the untamed jungles of Q'barra, and Valenar warbands have launched raids into Darguun and Karrnath. High King Shaeras Vadallia has promised to rein in his warriors, but many believe that the elves will continue their provocation. Their main interest is conflict with a worthy foe—and they might want Darguun or Karrnath to declare war.

Because of this, the nation remains on a war footing. Villages find it challenging to produce the supplies required to maintain the elf army. Still, the Valenar are rarely cruel overlords. As long as a village can meet its quotas, the elves leave it alone, though villages that fall below expectations are more likely to receive assistance from druidic advisors than punishment.

## Zilargo
**Capital**: Trolanport

**Hallmarks**: Alchemy, education, elemental binding, entertainment, gnomes, precious stones

At first glance, the homeland of the gnomes appears to be a paradise. City streets are bright and clean, the universities and libraries are the finest in Khorvaire, everyone seems happy and helpful, and crime is all but unheard of. But Zil society teems with layers of intrigue and blackmail invisible to human eyes. The Trust, a ruthless secret police force, eliminates any threat to society.

![[081-2-13.png|right|300]]

Zilargo isn't a tyranny. Each major city has a democratically elected ruling council and a seat on the Triumvirate that governs the nation; the Trust reports to the Triumvirate. The Zil gnomes built this system, and they are quite happy with it. Their streets are safe, and as long as you play by the rules of the game, the Trust ignores you. Outsiders find this casual acceptance of preemptive assassination to be terrifying, but the Zil genuinely trust the Trust.

Zil gnomes live within a web of intrigues. The Trust condones their actions, as long as they break no laws and don't threaten the state or the status quo. A gnome charlatan can connive to steal a jewel mine from another gnome—as long as the charlatan accomplishes the deed through cunning, negotiation, or deception rather than violence or outright theft, and as long as the mine stays in Zil hands. The same applies to adventurers planning schemes in Zilargo. Violence draws attention and deadly consequences from the Trust, but intrigue is perfectly acceptable.

The Trust is a network of spies and assassins. Most agents of the Trust simply pass information through dead drops; some estimate that a third of the nation works for the Trust in this capacity. When the Trust identifies a threat, it acts preemptively. Trust agents prefer to solve a problem without violence—by sharing a piece of information or a whispered warning sent via a *message* spell. But the Trust won't hesitate to eliminate a threat, whether with poison, spell, or blade. Typically, a target never sees the agent of their demise.

### Interesting Things About Zilargo
- Most consider the Library of Korranberg the finest repository of knowledge in Khorvaire.
- The *Korranberg Chronicle* is the leading source of news in Khorvaire. Gnome chroniclers travel across Khorvaire in search of stories.
- The major cities of Zilargo maintain temples and shrines dedicated to every religion. Most Zil explore a few faiths before settling on one; others practice multiple religions.

### Zil Characters
As you develop a Zil character, consider the following factors:

**Family Ties**. In a nation shaped by intrigue, you need someone you can rely on. For the Zil, that's family. Unless you're an orphan, discuss your family with your DM. What's their business? Who's your favorite relative? Are you currently involved in any family schemes? Family members might call on you for help over the course of your adventurers, but they can also be a resource for you.

**Knowledge and Power**. The Zil prize knowledge above all else. Sage is a suitable background for any Zil; charlatan and spy are also appropriate, reflecting their love of intrigue. Classes that specialize in melee combat are rare among the Zil. The soldiers of Zilargo include rogues, bards, wizards, and artificers.

**The Trust**. In creating a Zil character, consider whether you have any ties to the Trust. A vast number of gnomes serve as the eyes and ears of the Trust, reporting interesting information to a Trust handler. As an active agent, you could receive missions tied to your current adventures. If you and your companions are fighting the Emerald Claw, you might have a secondary assignment to eliminate a specific Claw agent or acquire a particular object from their base. While the spy background is a logical choice for a Trust agent, the agency recruits characters of every class and background. Your class abilities reflect specialized training and granted abilities—the magical equivalent of spy gadgets!

### Cities and Sites
The gnomes of Zilargo place a high value on appearances. They design beauty into their architecture, featuring delicate carvings, elaborate railings and balconies, and lavish gardens. Every community contains murals and statues scattered throughout. Most fixtures and buildings are designed for those of small stature, but buildings constructed for taller folk also exist. The Zil have a talent for illusion and for binding elementals, and they incorporate both of these forms of magic into everyday life.

#### Korranberg
Nestled against the base of the Seawall Mountains, Korranberg is the oldest city in Zilargo. Many aristocrats of other nations come to study in the famous library and the gnome colleges of Korranberg. The ancestral citadel of House Sivis is located here, as well as a host of temples including the Codex Vault, Khorvaire's largest shrine to Aureon.

#### Thurimbar
This port city draws musicians and artists from across Khorvaire. It addition to its legendary clubs and schools of music, Thurimbar is on the cutting edge of arcane sound—the use of illusion magic to generate music. Entertainers flock to Thurimbar to share their music and immerse themselves in its rich musical culture.

#### Trolanport
With its crisscrossing canals and flooded streets, the capital of Zilargo serves as the center of the gnome shipbuilding industry and a nexus for trade. Scores of ships make port here daily. Among the many beautiful things the city is known for are its spectacular coastal thunderstorms. Crowds gather on balconies and verandas to watch these awesome displays.

The Tower of the Triumvirate rises over the central portion of the city. House Kundarak, House Sivis, and House Cannith maintain outposts in the city, and the other dragonmarked houses station agents here as well.

#### Zolanberg
Hidden high in the Seawall Mountains, Zolanberg lies at the heart of a network of jewel mines. These mines face attacks by kobolds living in the mountains, as well as goblin raiders from Darguun. Gnomes and dwarves inhabit the city. House Kundarak maintains a great vault here while House Tharashk has completed construction of a large hall for the Prospectors Guild.

### Aftermath of the Last War
Walking the streets of Korranberg, one might never know that the war occurred. Zilargo avoided most of the violence of the Last War, and cosmetic magic and illusions were employed to repair the few cities that suffered damage. Many Zil prefer to ignore the war completely, referring to it as "that unpleasantness to the north." Nonetheless, Zilargo was a staunch ally of Breland during the war, providing the nation with ships, intelligence, and elemental weaponry. This aid left the nation with enemies. The Order of the Emerald Claw has launched attacks on Zil communities, and certain cells of Breland's Swords of Liberty accuse the Zil of manipulating Breland. The Trust has contained these attacks, but it always anticipates more trouble ahead.

The jewel miners of eastern Zilargo often clash with the goblins of Darguun and the kobolds that live in Seawall Mountains. These skirmishes could expand into wider conflicts.

Overall, however, little has changed in Zilargo because the Trust keeps the nation on a steady path. Adventurers who travel through Zilargo would be wise to avoid causing trouble or drawing the Trust's attention.

# Chapter 2: Khorvaire Gazeteer - Distant Lands
This section of the gazetteer provides a glimpse of the wonder and adventure found in the lands beyond Khorvaire's horizon. Use these entries to inspire adventures that take place in these distant lands, and to introduce trinkets or relics from foreign realms into Khorvaire.

![[083-map-aerenal-large.jpg|right|300]]((Player Version))
## Aerenal
In Aerenal, you might...

- Consult an elven archmage who's been dead for twenty thousand years.
- Battle sinister forces that have crawled into Eberron from a realm of eternal night.
- Learn secrets of magic unknown in Khorvaire.

The massive island of Aerenal is the ancient kingdom of the elves. Its jungles provide strange and valuable lumbers: soarwood used for the hulls of airships, tough bronzewood, and trees that remain alive after being felled.

The island's proximity to the planes of Irian and Mabar (both described in *chapter 4*) allows the lines between life and death to become blurred. Dangerous, dark forces creep in from the plane known as the Endless Night, but that planar resonance also enables the elves to perform feats of necromancy unmatched elsewhere in Eberron. Among the Aereni elves, the honored dead walk among the living. Heroes who died in glorious battle return to serve the Sibling Kings. And in the depths of Shae Mordai, the deathless lords of the Undying Court study the shifting balance of the planes and the path of the Draconic Prophecy.

Necromancy is a pillar of Aereni society, distinct from the sinister power most adventurers encounter. Positive energy sustains the deathless undead of Aerenal—both the light of Irian and the devotion freely given by their descendants. The elves of Aerenal despise necromancy that draws on the negative energy of Mabar, and agents of the Undying Court embrace their mandate to seek out and destroy vampires, liches, and other such undead.

Aereni civilization is over twenty thousand years old. Secure in their island sanctuary, the elves watched nations of goblins and humans rise and fall. The Aereni possess secrets and powers the rest of Khorvaire has yet to discover, but they are more interested in perfecting their ancient traditions than in innovation and discovery. An Aereni wizard might spend a decade refining the pronunciation of a single spell's incantation. For now, humanity can't match the power of the elves. If that balance changes, will Aerenal take action?

![[084-2-14.png|right|300]](Shae Mordai)

### Notable Locations
Aerenal taunts visitors with its ancient secrets and trackless jungles.

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Nightlife of the walking dead
>>The port city of Pylas Talaear is a place of wonders. Stand on the steps of the Grand Temple and look down upon the High Street and you'll see fountains of light casting shadows across buildings that have stood for over ten thousand years. Brilliant motes dance through the air—spectral messengers carrying words across the city. But the most remarkable feature of Pylas Talaear is the dead. If you know anything about Aerenal, you've surely heard of the Undying Court, the deathless cabinet that guides the nation. Only the grandest members of society win elevation to the Undying Court, but there are many forms of preservation. Go to the Dalaen Forge and you'll see the ghost of Old Dalaen advising his descendants as they work wood and steel. Visit the Eidolon Tavern and you'll see poltergeists mixing drinks, and you can get advice from a spectral bartender with thousands of years of wisdom to share. Visit Maer Crossing at midnight and you'll see the spirit of Lady Jhaelian dance with a grace unmatched by any living elf.
>>
>>Wondrous as it is, as a human visitor, I found it more than a little unnerving. There's no escaping the past in Aerenal; it lingers all around you, whispering advice or warning you to avoid transgression. You never know when you'll feel the tingle of spectral fingers against your skin or hear the whisper of an elf who's older than human civilization. There are many wonders in Aerenal... just don't get buried in the past.
>>

#### Pylas Talaear
The gateway to Aerenal, this port city is the primary point of contact between Aerenal and the outside world. In this city driven by commerce, almost all the dragonmarked houses have outposts here, and it includes vast markets, warehouses, and lumber yards.

#### Shae Cairdal
This city is the capital of Aerenal, the seat of the Sibling Kings, and the center for commerce and diplomacy between the elven families, who otherwise remain isolated in their own city-states. Foreigners are encouraged to conduct business in Pylas Talaear.

#### Shae Mordai
This ancient citadel houses the Undying Court, the deathless ancestors who shape the destiny of Aerenal. It is built atop a rift to the Plane of Irian and suffused with positive energy. Almost no commerce takes place here. This center for arcane study also serves as a memorial to all the heroes of the elves, both the deathless and those lost in the distant past. The Citadel of the Court is said to be far larger than it appears and to hold the greatest treasures of the elves.

#### The North
The northern steppes of Aerenal are the domain of the Tairnadal, the warrior elves who seized control of Valenar. Although much of their population now resides in Valenar, many Tairnadal noncombatants—children, artisans, and the druids who raise their remarkable beasts—remain in Aerenal.

### Aerenal's Influence in Khorvaire
In Khorvaire, you might...

- Team up with an agent of the Undying Court to bring down a powerful vampire.
- Be summoned by a deathless sage who needs your help to fulfill an ancient prophecy.
- Bargain with a merchant offering rare magic items.

Few Aereni elves are interested in the world beyond their island. The Aereni see Khorvaire as a primitive backwater, and humans as dangerously impulsive. Aereni who travel to Khorvaire have a concrete purpose for the journey, which could drive an adventure.

The magewrights and artificers of Aerenal are more advanced than those of Khorvaire. Aereni artisans fashion rods, staffs, and wands, and other rare or even legendary items may come from Aerenal. However, the nation is less industrialized than Khorvaire. Legendary items aren't mass produced; some are personally crafted by members of the Undying Court.

Aereni goods make use of exotic plants and woods. Bronzewood has the density and even some of the properties of steel; an Aereni cleric might wear a bronzewood breastplate, while a paladin of the Undying Court could wear a suit of elaborated engraved bronzewood plate armor. Bronzewood leaves are remarkably tough, and the Aereni craft "leaf weave" armor functionally equivalent to leather, studded leather, or chain mail. Bronzewood can also be crafted into weapons, and Aereni warriors use spears or swords made from a single piece of bronzewood.

##### Trinkets from Aerenal
| d8 | Trinket |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A bronzewood ring inscribed with the Elvish word for "hope" |
| 2 | A dried flower; if it's placed in water, it blooms |
| 3 | An ebony locket; when it's opened, an elven voice whispers "Always" |
| 4 | A tiny skull carved from dark wood |
| 5 | A finger bone inscribed with an unknown sigil |
| 6 | An ivory flute which produces no sound |
| 7 | A small journal made from preserved leaves |
| 8 | A book of poetry written by undead elves |

## Argonnessen
In Argonnessen, you could...

- Clash with tribes of dragon-worshiping barbarians.
- Explore an ancient city of dragons.
- Discover mighty artifacts and long-lost spells.

Argonnessen is home to the oldest civilization on Eberron. The dragons wield ancient magic, and they have shielded their homeland against divination and teleportation. Tribes of barbarians roam the Seren Islands and the coastlines of Argonnessen; these include members of almost every humanoid race, perhaps collected by dragons in ages past. The Seren barbarians worship the dragons and protect the coasts from invaders. To date, no one from Khorvaire has ventured into the interior of the continent and returned to speak of it.

No one knows how many dragons live in Argonnessen, but stories tell of vast cavern complexes filled with the treasures of fallen civilizations, of prisons holding bound demons, of cities made from adamantine.

To those of Khorvaire, Argonnessen is a mystery space on the map. Only the most powerful characters might visit Argonnessen and return to tell the tale.

### Argonnessen's Influence in Khorvaire
In Khorvaire, you might...

- Prevent a villain from acquiring a powerful artifact smuggled out of Argonnessen.
- Encounter a dragonborn barbarian born on the Seren islands, who shares tales of mighty wyrms.
- Battle a dragon who guards a hidden vault.

Some say the mysterious dragons of Argonnessen hide in plain sight, that shapechanged dragons scattered across Khorvaire pull the strings of civilization. According to some stories, the dragons seek to protect the younger races from vile fiends. In other tales, the dragons see the people of Khorvaire as fodder for arcane experiments. A dragon could be encountered as an ally or as a cruel enemy who casually crushes humanoids.

The magic of Argonnessen is far more powerful than the forces wielded by the wizards of Khorvaire. Many of the greatest artifacts in history were made in Argonnessen. Dragons are infused with magic, and their creations are made from the bones and scales of their kind.

##### Trinkets from Argonnessen
| d10 | Trinket |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A pierced dragon scale on a cord |
| 2 | A statuette of a dragon carved from black bone |
| 3 | A dragon's tooth, engraved with an unknown sigil |
| 4 | A child's doll of a dragon, woven from leather cords |
| 5 | A dagger carved from a dragon's talon |
| 6 | A brass disk bearing the silhouette of a black dragon |
| 7 | A small egg-shaped piece of polished bone |
| 8 | A bone fragment with brass inlaid runes |
| 9 | A leather pouch filled with tiny draconic teeth |
| 10 | A single large seed that's warm to the touch |

## Khyber
In Khyber, you could...

- Fight mind flayers and armies of hideous aberrations.
- Discover a wondrous realm lit by an inner sun.
- Prevent a fiendish overlord from escaping its ancient prison.

The common creation myth contends that when the Progenitor Dragons fought, Eberron trapped Khyber in her coils and became the world, imprisoning her evil sibling in a living prison. Bound within the world, Khyber spawns demons and monsters to plague the children of Eberron. This might be myth and metaphor, but it's also a description of fact: there are worlds within the world, realms inhabited by aberrations, fiends, and all manner of monsters.

Any time someone descends below the surface of the world, they enter Khyber. But the underworld takes two very different forms. First is the natural realm, networks of tunnels and caverns formed from stone and soil. These passages are dark and dangerous, but they're exactly what you expect to find in an underground realm. Such passages might be home to carrion crawlers, giant beetles, or clans of kobolds. But ultimately these mundane caverns follow the laws of nature.

There's another aspect to Khyber: go deep enough and you find a seemingly endless array of demiplanes, each stranger than the last. When descending into a chasm, you could find a labyrinth inhabited by demons or discover a realm consisting of the guts of a colossal living creature. Anything is possible in Khyber, and these "worlds within" are home to all manner of terrors.

The demiplanes of Khyber are not concretely tied to the world above. You could discover a passage in Breland that leads into a disturbing subterranean swamp filled with oozes and slimes. After traveling what seems to be a few miles, you might emerge from a different tunnel in Xen'drik, half a world away from where you began.

The Mror Holds demonstrate this mystery. Over the past century, the dwarves discovered a vast subterranean kingdom within the Ironroot Mountains. Most of these halls rest in the natural layers of Khyber. The halls connect to one another in logical cartographic order. But as the ancient dwarves dug deeper, they opened passages into the unnatural realms and unleashed the hordes of the daelkyr **Dyrrn** the Corruptor. Passages to **Dyrrn**'s realm also exist in the Shadow Marches, on the opposite side of Khorvaire. The Corruptor's domain doesn't necessarily stretch across the entire world; the portals to the worlds within defy natural law.

These connections impact the world in a number of ways. Dark forces can rise anywhere in the world, bursting out of a previously unknown portal to Khyber. This fact dictates the primary mission of the Church of the Silver Flame: to stand ready to defend the innocent from such unnatural threats. Because the demiplanes connect to the world at random, you never know what you might find when you venture into the depths. A newly opened chasm in the sewers could be an entirely mundane hole in the ground, or it could be a passage to the Abyssal Forests of Khar.

The many layers of Khyber share similarity only in their strangeness and deadliness. Eberron is the natural world; Khyber is the source of fiends and monstrosities and the domain of the alien daelkyr. Some cults of the Dragon Below believe that paradise awaits them in the Vale of the Inner Sun, but such cultists also consider gibbering mouthers and mind flayers to be creatures of beauty. Wondrous treasures might wait in the worlds below amid hordes of demons and aberrations.

### Khyber's Influence in Khorvaire
In Khorvaire, you might...

- Find a way to close a passage to Khyber before a horde of horrors emerges from it.
- Battle a mind flayer that has established a cult in the sewers.
- Stop the spread of a deadly drug or strange disease flowing from a well tied to Khyber.

Khyber is an ever-present threat. Any deep passage could connect to a realm of fiends or spew out an army of aberrations. Despite the magnitude of this threat, portals to Khyber are very rare, and they are stable once found. If you dig a hole in the ground, the odds that you'll eventually reach the Vale of the Inner Sun are infinitesimal. And if a portal to Khyber existed in the sewers of Fairhaven, odds are good that it would already have been discovered. The risk arises when you're exploring passages where no one has gone before. The sewers of Fairhaven might be safe today, but if an earthquake opens a new shaft or a group of cultists digs deeper, a previously unknown passage to Khyber could be uncovered. Wherever a passage to Khyber appears, monsters and dark powers can rise up to threaten the world above.

Cults of the Dragon Below often have ties to Khyber. Some serve aberrations or fight alongside dolgrims and dolgaunts (see *chapter 6*). Others can unintentionally threaten a community by releasing something from the underworld: an unnatural disease, a malevolent demon, or a strange and addictive drug. In dealing with such a cult, the question is not only how to stop their current machinations, but how to seal the passage or prevent it from posing an ongoing threat.

Treasures from Khyber can take many forms. The daelkyr create living tools, including symbionts (see *chapter 5*), but any magic item could be presented as an organic creation: a living *cloak of the mountebank* that teleports its wearer through the plane of madness; a *dagger of venom* made from chitin and muscle, similar to a scorpion's barb; a *crystal ball* made by the daelkyr **Belashyrra** that looks like a giant eye, casting visions of distant places directly into the wielder's mind. Items recovered from fiendish demiplanes might be constructed from standard materials but have a sinister aspect or appearance, such as a *sword of life stealing* from the Abyssal Forest of Khar made of jagged, blackened steel. Shadows trail the blade, and it issues a hungry moan any time it draws blood.

![[085-2-15.png|right|300]](Frostfell)

## North and South Poles
At the world's poles—Everice to the south and the Frostfell to the north—you might...

- Discover an ancient civilization hidden beneath the ice.
- Search for the survivors of a lost expedition.
- Find the source of a mysterious mystical signal.

It's common knowledge that Everice is the domain of the Queen of Winter, an archfey who commands a host of winter wolves and knights carved from living ice. The queen lives in a glacial palace, and those who overcome her guards and the deadly weather to earn her favor can gain powerful boons.

It's also common knowledge that Everice is the home of frost giants who escaped the destruction of Xen'drik. Now they hone their arctic magic and plot vengeance. However, a clan of white dragons battle the giants to keep them from growing too powerful. Woe betide the people of Khorvaire if dragon and giant ever set aside their ancient vendetta and join forces!

The Frostfell is thought to be the original homeland of the dwarves, and some believe that an ancient nation of dwarves still thrives under the ice. Others say that the Frostfell was once a verdant realm until the dwarves uncovered the prison of an archfiend, which buried their nation under endless ice. These scholars warn against disturbing this overlord, lest a new age of ice be unleashed across the entire world.

Mystery shrouds the poles of Eberron. A few expeditions have ventured to the Frostfell, but no one from Khorvaire has set foot in Everice in living memory and returned to speak of it.

### The Frostfell's and Everice's Influence in Khorvaire
In Khorvaire, you might...

- Clash with a cabal of winter warlocks serving a sinister power stirring in Everice.
- Encounter a group of frost giants or Frostfell dwarves establishing a foothold in Khorvaire.
- Discover a journal from a Frostfell expedition that reveals a horrifying threat.

The people of Khorvaire have no commerce with the arctic regions and no certainty about what lives there. If a threat comes from Everice, it might take time for people to identify its origin.

With this in mind, relics from Everice or the Frostfell could take any form. Are these treasures created by giants, fey, or dwarves? Are they carved from eternal ice, or are they forged from dwarven steel? If the civilization of the dwarves truly began in the Frostfell, did it fall into ruin, or are there progenitor dwarves who possess spells and weapons beyond anything known in Khorvaire? And how would these ancient dwarf lords react to their Mror descendants?

##### Trinkets from the Frostfell and Everice

## Sarlona
In Sarlona, you could...

- Infiltrate an empire ruled by psychic overlords.
- Defend an ancient mountain monastery.
- Disable a monolith used to control the dreams of a city.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the vast continent of Sarlona was the cradle of human civilization. Three thousand years ago, the first human colonists left, setting in motion events shaping modern-day Khorvaire.

Sarlona was once home to over a dozen distinct kingdoms, but wars devastated the continent. From this chaos, a band of saviors rose up to forge a new world. Guided by celestial spirits and endowed with vast psionic powers, these champions became known as the Inspired. Today, the Inspired have united the broken nations into a single realm: the Empire of Riedra. Outsiders aren't welcome in Riedra, and little is known of the nation. Merchants tell stories of massive monoliths that control the dreams of the people, and of secret police who use psionics to root out dissidents.

A single nation stands against the might of Riedra: the mountain refuge of Adar, homeland of the kalashtar (see *chapter 1*). The Adarans lack the numbers to challenge Riedra, yet they hold their fortress monasteries against endless waves of Riedran assaults. The Adarans possess remarkable psychic and martial disciplines.

### Notable Locations
Like Khorvaire, Sarlona primarily occupies the northern hemisphere of Eberron, and it has all the climatic and topographic variety one would expect given its immensity. A few places in Sarlona known to Khorvairians are described below.

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Beneath the Basalt Towers, Part 3
>>When I first spoke to the Morgrave board, I hid the details I share with you now. I did this not from malice, nor even from fear that I would be ridiculed, but rather because I could not bear to revisit the horrors I had seen beneath the merciless Menechtarun sands. I force myself to revisit them now only in the hopes that in so doing, I can prevent any fools from following in our footsteps and sharing the fate of my fallen friends.
>>
>>We'd made camp in the upper floor of the tower, for thousands of years of shifting sand had left that as the easiest point of entry. We were surrounded by cyclopean bones, and I found myself facing the empty gaze of a skull taller than I was. Melanora questioned how these grim remnants could linger for so long, but I dismissed it as the remarkable effect of the exceptionally dry climate. If only I had given more thought to this matter, Melanora might still be with us today. Instead she lies lost beneath the basalt towers, trapped in hideous service to the ancient powers that dwell in the darkness.

#### Dar Jin
This port city is the only legal point of entry for foreigners who wish to enter the Empire of Riedra. All travelers remain confined in the foreign quarter. Merchants from across Khorvaire trade for exotic Riedran goods, while envoys from many nations negotiate with the emissaries of the Inspired. To enter Riedra proper, travelers must obtain a transit visa from the Iron Gate, the office of foreign relations. The office grants few such visas; visitors must make a compelling case for entry or find a secret way to evade the watchful eyes of the Iron Gate.

#### Kasshta Keep
All but one of the monasteries of Adar lie concealed behind a blend of psychic and arcane techniques. Kasshta Keep refuses to hide from outsiders or the Inspired. It is the de facto capital of Adar and the abode of the Keeper of the Word, who guides the kalashtar people. High in the mountains, the monastery is reached by winches and lifts. Its inhabitants include wizards, monks, and mystics; if you want to play a monk from an exotic land, you could have learned your art in Kasshta Keep.

#### Ohr Kaluun
Riedra built its empire on the foundation of a dozen shattered nations. Scholars consider the loss of these nations to be a tragedy... except for Ohr Kaluun. The lords of this ancient kingdom were driven by deep paranoia and an all-consuming thirst for power. The sages of Ohr Kaluun studied the darkest paths of magic and bargained with fiends and other foul creatures. They warped their bodies through mystical rituals and pacts, creating the first changelings, skulks, and tiefling bloodlines. Ohr Kaluun was ultimately consumed by the feuds of its paranoid mage-lords and the crusading legions of its neighbors. Today, it is a shunned region, haunted and cursed. Dark secrets and great treasures remain in the vast war labyrinths of Ohr Kaluun, but fiends, wards, and far deadlier threats linger in this fallen kingdom.

### Sarlona's Influence in Khorvaire
In Khorvaire, you might...

- Struggle to expose the schemes of an order of psychic assassins.
- Steal a memory crystal from an Inspired ambassador.
- Help an Adaran envoy deliver a vital message to a kalashtar elder.

Although outsiders aren't welcome in Riedra, the empire is a powerful nation and a valuable trading partner. Riedra offered assistance to multiple nations during the Last War. Karrnath relied on Riedran aid to survive a wave of terrible famines, and Aundair also received support from Riedra. King Sebastes of Q'barra has used Riedran troops to maintain order in Newthrone.

Riedrans rarely appear on the streets of Khorvaire, but Inspired ambassadors attend every court. Although the Inspired present themselves as generous and kind, a darker force followed them across the sea. The Dreaming Dark is an enigmatic order of monks, assassins, warlocks, and mystics. Their ultimate agenda remains unknown, but they hunt the kalashtar and some believe they can control people by manipulating their dreams. While most people dismiss the Dreaming Dark as a foolish story, you might uncover the truth behind the tales.

Both the Inspired of Riedra and the kalashtar of Adar possess psychic powers, and treasures from Sarlona reflect this. A set of Sarlonan *sending stones* might take the form of crystals that allow telepathic communication. The *rod of rulership*, *ring of mind shielding*, *ring of telekinesis*, *potion of mind reading*, and the *medallion of thoughts* could represent psychic items from Sarlona.

In addition to psychic treasures, Sarlona is a source of a number of exotic plants and medicines. Dreamlily (described in chapter 4) is a useful Sarlonan narcotic, but over the course of the past few decades it has become a common recreational drug.

##### Trinkets from Sarlona
| d8 | Trinket |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A polished crystal sphere; when you clutch it in your fist, a telepathic voice recites a story in your mind |
| 2 | A teardrop pendant made from polished shell; when you hold it, you see the image of a young Riedran man |
| 3 | A six-sided crystal die; when you roll it, you feel a surge of emotion for six seconds |
| 4 | A sealed vial filled with faintly luminescent blue mist |
| 5 | A crystal disk engraved with a labyrinthine pattern |
| 6 | A leather-bound collection of kalashtar poetry called *Shards of the Light* |
| 7 | A sphere of polished crystal; when you hold it in your palm, you feel that it knows you and understands you |
| 8 | A cup and ball toy; when you successfully catch the ball in the cup, you feel a momentary surge of joy |

## Xen'drik
![[087-map-xendrik-large.jpg|right|300]]((Player Version))In Xen'drik, you could...

- Seek to destroy an ancient mystical weapon before it falls into the hands of villains.
- Battle savage giants in the ruins of their ancient cities.
- Match wits with cunning drow in the depths of a primordial jungle.

Any follower of the Sovereign Host knows this story about Xen'drik. In the dawn of time, the Sovereigns bound the fiendish overlords and freed the world from chaos. The mighty giants had fought alongside the Sovereigns, and in gratitude Aureon granted them dominion over the continent of Xen'drik. Aureon taught giants the secrets of wizardry, and they grew powerful. The giants built towers that touched the sky and seemingly endless cities.

The mightiest among the giants was the titan Cul'sir. His power was so great that he pulled the thirteenth moon from the sky and crushed it in a fit of anger. The giants ruled many lesser races, and eventually the elves rose up against them. Cul'sir unleashed plagues upon the rebellious elves. He made assassins of elven shadows and turned them back against their owners. Still the rebels persisted. In his anger, Cul'sir prepared to pull down the rest of the moons to hurl them at his enemies, even though he'd destroy the world in doing it. But the giants had gone too far, and Aureon set the dragons of Argonnessen upon them. The dragons destroyed the vast cities and leveled the towers. Cul'sir was slain and his people scattered.

The Sovereigns and Six each laid a curse upon the land. Aureon decreed that the creatures of Xen'drik would have no knowledge of law, and Boldrei proclaimed that no city would stand. The Traveler distorted the land so that no path followed twice. The Devourer unleashed fire and storm. And so Xen'drik remains a land of mystery, a realm that cannot be mapped, a place that holds secrets that could shatter the world.

This story bears at least some truth. The elves were once slaves of the ancient giants, and the dragons did eradicate the civilizations of Xen'drik. Great magic has warped the land. The environments of Xen'drik are extreme and unpredictable, and travelers might find a glacial expanse in the midst of a vast desert. Tens of thousands of years have passed, yet no civilization has risen to the heights of the fallen giants; some believe that Aureon's and Boldrei's curses ensure that any city that grows too large collapses into madness. The Traveler's Curse twists space, and explorers might follow the same path twice only to end up in entirely different locations.

Xen'drik is a continent that defies control. Expeditions have unearthed artifacts of immense power, as well as fields of Siberys dragonshards (see *chapter 5*), but once you leave a site, you might never find it again.

Giants still roam Xen'drik, but these creatures have never regained the glory of their ancestors. Tribes of drow—said to be the shadow-assassins created by the Emperor Cul'sir—linger in the darkness. These represent just a few of the threats in this vast land.

### Notable Locations
Many ports dot the coast of Xen'drik. In addition to the treasures of the giants, Xen'drik is a source of Siberys dragonshards and other exotic resources. Scholars and merchants come to Xen'drik on business, smugglers seek to make extra gold, and pirates prey on everyone. Ports come and go, falling prey to monsters or natural disasters. But two harbors have stood the test of time.

***Dar Qat.*** The Inspired lords of Riedra are just as interested in the resources of Xen'drik as the people of Khorvaire. Dar Qat is a Riedran port, a fortress built from glittering crysteel (grown crystal as strong as steel) and dwarfed by a nearby monolith believed to serve as a psychic anchor for the city. Outsiders are rarely welcome within the walls of Dar Qat.

***Stormreach.*** Once a haven for pirates and smugglers, Stormreach has become a thriving port that serves as the passage to the Xen'drik interior. All the dragonmarked houses have outposts in the city, and it is home to refugees, renegades, criminals, and others who have no place on the other continents. The city is ruled by the council of Storm Lords, who hold absolute power. As Stormreach is built on the foundations of an ancient giant city, ruins abound around and below the city. Some fear that if the city continues to expand, the growth will trigger an ancient curse. But for now, Stormreach is a prosperous community and a gateway to adventure.

### Xen'drik's Influence in Khorvaire
In Khorvaire, you might...

- Befriend a drow making their way in the new world.
- Stop the Emerald Claw from using a giant artifact to destroy a city.
- Aid a scholar in deciphering a book of prophecy found in the heart of Xen'drik and brought to Stormreach.

The tremendous diversity of the people of Xen'drik means that no single trait defines objects and artifacts from this land. The primitive drow make armor comparable to studded leather using the chitin of giant scorpions. Rumors abound of more advanced drow civilizations in the layers of Khyber that lie beneath Xen'drik. The elves lived and fought in Xen'drik before the exodus that took them to Aerenal, and elven artifacts remain scattered across the region. And the grandest treasures include the work of the giants—which can often be difficult to use because of their size. The spellbook of a giant wizard might hold priceless secrets, but the bulky tome can be quite awkward for smaller folk.

# Chapter 2: Khorvaire Gazeteer - Faiths of Khorvaire
Religion plays an important role in Eberron. The gods don't manifest physically, but people of faith believe that divine forces shape everyday life. Shared beliefs unite communities and can provide hope in difficult times.

Most Khorvairians acknowledge the pantheon of the Sovereign Host and its malign shadow, the Dark Six. The Sovereign Host was the dominant faith of the Kingdom of Galifar and holds sway over most of Khorvaire—except for Thrane, which favors the Church of the Silver Flame. Other religions connect specific cultures or communities; the kalashtar observe the Path of Light, and the Undying Court guides the elves of Aerenal.

Religion is especially important for a paladin, cleric, or druid, yet any character can have faith in a higher power. Following a religion is a way to give your character a deeper connection to the world and a bond to other members of the community. The Foundation of Faith table can provide ideas for the source of your beliefs.

Conversely, a lack of faith can also be a meaningful part of your story. If you don't believe in any divine power, what caused such doubt? The Rejection of Faith table offers ideas that can help shape your story.

##### Foundation of Faith
| d6 | Foundation |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | You were raised in the faith. Your religion is an important part of your family and community. |
| 2 | Someone you care about—a mentor, a friend, or a lover—introduced you to the faith. |
| 3 | You were raised in a different religion but became drawn to the ideals and beliefs of your current faith. |
| 4 | You never took your faith seriously. Then you made a vow during the Last War, pledging your devotion if a disaster was averted... and it was. |
| 5 | You're devoted to your religion, but you've never been formally educated in its ways. You follow your own personal interpretation. |
| 6 | You had a transcendental experience and believe you have a divine purpose to fulfill. |

##### Rejection of Faith
| d6 | Rejection |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | You believe that the magic of clerics and paladins doesn't come from deities, but from the caster's inner power or belief. |
| 2 | You come from an agnostic community and give little thought to spiritual matters. |
| 3 | You were once deeply devout, but a tragedy during the Last War caused you to question your faith. |
| 4 | A personal loss or betrayal shook your faith. |
| 5 | You were spiritually scarred by an encounter with a fiend or aberration. |
| 6 | You've created your own personal religion and believe that all the established faiths are flawed. |

![[094-2-16f.png|right|300]](The Path of Light)
## Sovereign Host
- The Sovereigns are with us at all times. Onatar stands at every forge, and Dol Dorn is with you whenever blades are drawn.
- The Sovereigns shape the world. They offer us guidance and strength, but we must learn to listen.
- Honor every Sovereign in their place and time. If you hear one voice clearly, embrace their path.
- As a follower of the Sovereign Host, you believe that the hand of the Sovereigns can be seen in all things. What others take to be intuition or instinct, you see as the voice of the Sovereigns offering guidance. You don't need absolute proof; the fact of a bountiful harvest is evidence of Arawai's benevolence.

The pantheon of the Sovereign Host embodies all that is good in the world. The people of Khorvaire have followed the Sovereigns for thousands of years, and everyone knows the names of the Sovereigns and the Dark Six. Even people who aren't devout might still swear by the Sovereigns or offer a prayer in a moment of crisis.

The Sovereign Host is wondrously diverse. Variations and subsects of the faith thrive, and temples are only loosely aligned. In a small community, a skilled smith might double as the priest because people believe he's close to Onatar. A midwife might symbolically speak for Arawai and Boldrei. Typically, the faithful are united by their shared beliefs; no central authority seeks to enforce a singular creed.

As a Vassal—a follower of the Sovereign Host—you might feel connection to a particular Sovereign, but still show reverence to each. Your background can influence your particular interpretation of the Sovereigns—the Talenta halflings consider the Sovereigns part of a pantheon of spirits, while some Karrns honor only the Sovereigns of war—but any character can be a Vassal.

### Sovereigns
These common names and attributes describe the nine Sovereigns as they are worshiped in Khorvaire:

**Arawai** is the Sovereign of Life and Love. She is the patron of fertility and of the benevolent aspects of nature, bringing good harvest and gentle rain.

**Aureon** is the Sovereign of Law and Lore. He is considered the first wizard, who shared the secrets of wizardry with the world.

**Balinor** is the Sovereign of Horn and Hunt. He guides both the beast and the hunter, and he is the patron of those who walk on the edge of civilization and the natural world.

**Boldrei** is the Sovereign of Hall and Hearth. She guides and protects communities and families, inspiring people to work together for the common good.

**Dol Arrah** is the sun that drives away the darkness. She stands for wisdom in war and for those who fight with honor, pursue justice, and make sacrifices for the greater good.

**Dol Dorn** is the Sovereign of Strength and Steel. He is the patron of the common soldier, and he guides the hands of anyone who holds a weapon. He embodies courage, strength, and martial skill.

**Kol Korran** is the Sovereign of World and Wealth. He guards travelers and guides traders. Although the Trickery domain is suggested for his clerics, Kol Korran guides fair negotiation; those driven solely by greed prefer the Keeper of the Dark Six.

**Olladra** is the Sovereign of Feast and Fortune. She is the giver of joy and the granter of luck, patron to entertainers, gamblers, and anyone who takes a chance.

**Onatar** is the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. He guides both mundane smiths and artificers, inspiring anyone who performs an act of creation.

### Symbol
The Octagram is the symbol of the Host as a whole. A Sovereign priest either carries a metal Octagram holy symbol or holds a staff tipped with the icon. Priests dedicated to a particular god also display their deity's symbol, and Vassals carry tokens with the symbols of the Sovereigns whose favor they seek. There are eight points in the symbol for eight Sovereigns; the ninth Sovereign (Aureon) is represented by the Octagram itself.

### Rites
Formal prayers to the Sovereigns usually involve song. Specific songs invoke each Sovereign and seek their favor, appreciate the blessings received, and recognize the presence of a Sovereign. Celebrants sing the songs of Boldrei and Aureon at weddings, and soldiers sing Dol Dorn's marching songs on the move and Dol Arrah's hymns on the dawn before a battle.

### Temples
Sovereign shrines arise where people feel the deities are close, such as a library for Aureon or a smithy for Onatar. The rites of Boldrei or Arawai typically occur in the wild, and a tavern could serve as a shrine to Olladra. The shrines can take any form, but they prominently display the symbol of the particular Sovereign.

Temple of the Sovereign Host are made of stone and have eight doors. The walls depict images of the Sovereigns, with the icon of Aureon over the altar and the Octagram engraved on the floor.

## Dark Six
The Dark Six are the shadows of the Sovereign Host. These dark gods shape the world and are present at all times, speaking to those willing to hear them. Where the Sovereigns govern positive forces, the Dark Six are the source of fears. Arawai and Balinor reflect the positive aspects of nature. The devastating storm, the earthquake, the wildfire? These are the work of the Devourer.

>> ##### The Voice of Thrane—Are you a six fanatic?
>>The Vassals of the Sovereign Host have long condemned the Dark Six as forces of evil. Yet correspondents at the *Voice of Thrane* have uncovered a shocking phenomenon: long-standing cults that worship members of the Dark Six alongside the Sovereign Host.
>>
>>Most of you know of the Restful Watch, the priests who tend Vassal cemeteries. What you may not know is that the priests of the Watch honor both Aureon and the Keeper! They say that the Keeper snatches the souls of heroes so they can be preserved from Dolurrh and returned when they are needed once more.
>>
>>Worse still is the Three Faces of War, a cult that worships the Sovereigns of War—including the Mockery, whom they call Dol Azur. Followers of this foul faith say that the battlefield holds a place for all of these gods, explicitly embracing a deity they acknowledge as the patron of treachery and terror! This cult apparently began in the Karrnathi military but spread across the Five Nations during the Last War. So next time you're talking to a Brelish soldier, remember that they might be a devotee of the Mockery!
>>

The Dark Six and the Sovereign Host are opposite sides of the same coin. If you believe in one, you acknowledge the existence of the other. The only question is whether you fear the Six or revere them. Those who choose to follow these sinister deities embrace darkness. A barbarian may thank the Fury for the gift of rage. An assassin walks the path of the Mockery, while a warlock's pact may be a gift of the Shadow.

The Dark Six inspire worship in different ways among diverse cultures. Temples to the Dark Six appear in Droaam, along with wild revels driven by the Fury. The Dark Six aren't worshiped openly elsewhere in Khorvaire; the gods' shrines are hidden, and it's more common to find a cult devoted to a single member of the Six than a temple dedicated to the entire pantheon.

### The Six
These common names and attributes describe the Dark Six as they are known in Khorvaire:

**The Devourer** governs the destructive power of nature, both pure elemental force and savagery in beasts.

**The Keeper** snatches souls before they can reach Dolurrh and hoards them along with his vast wealth. Those driven by greed call him their patron, and his priests often act as criminal fixers.

**The Fury** governs both passion and revenge, rage and despair. She offers revenge to those who have been wronged, but her vengeance often leads to suffering.

**The Mockery** is the patron of treachery and of terror in battle. He guides those who seek victory through guile, both warriors and assassins. He was once the brother of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah, but he was stripped of his skin and his name after betraying them.

**The Shadow** is the dark side of knowledge and ambition. It's said to be Aureon's shadow, given malign life when Aureon mastered magic. The Shadow is the maker of monsters and the keeper of forbidden secrets, and it offers malevolent spells to warlocks and wizards.

**The Traveler** asserts that chaos drives evolution and that change makes us stronger. The Traveler is a trickster and the giver of dangerous gifts. Some artificers worship the Traveler, seeing it as the lord of innovation, but the gifts of the Traveler always have unexpected consequences.

### Symbol
The Hexagram represents the entire pantheon of the Dark Six. The Deities of Eberron table lists the common symbols of the individual gods. However, since the Six aren't worshiped openly in most of Khorvaire, each sect chooses a unique symbol based on the nature of their god. Followers of the Devourer might carry a shark's tooth or a piece of wood scorched in a wildfire. A Keeper cult might use the nine-sided coin of Kol Korran with the face disfigured. A particular sect uses these symbols consistently, if not obviously.

### Rites
The Dark Six are a mirror of the Sovereign Host and their worship uses similar rituals, including formal rituals conducted in song.

Each of the Six has their own rites. Followers of the Fury engage in wild revels. Cults of the Devourer gather around enormous bonfires. Cults of the Mockery conduct ritual combats or gather to torture captured enemies.

### Temples
Temples and shrines of the Dark Six hide behind disguises. A cult of the Mockery might gather in a slaughterhouse, while a shrine to the Shadow remains concealed in the deep stacks of a library. Dedicated temples are built from dark stone, with six doors and the Hexagram engraved in the floor.

## Church of the Silver Flame
- The Silver Flame is force of light that holds fiends at bay. Those who seek to defend the innocent from evil can draw on the power of the Flame.
- Every mortal soul can find the light. Inspire and guide others to virtuous behavior; force is a last resort.
- Listen to the Voice of the Flame; beware the deceiving whispers of the Shadow in the Flame.

Every Thrane child knows the story of Tira Miron. Centuries ago, one of the ancient and powerful demons chained within the world broke free from its bonds, unleashing terrible suffering on the people of Thrane. The nation would have been destroyed if not for Tira Miron. This paladin was called by the Silver Flame and battled the mighty fiend. When it became clear that the overlord couldn't be destroyed, Tira gave her life, combining her spirit with the light of the Silver Flame to bind the demon once more. Now Tira serves as the Voice of the Flame, helping others find the light. Anyone who seeks to protect the innocent and battle evil can draw on the power of the Silver Flame to aid them, but they must beware of the Shadow in the Flame, the demon that still lingers and yearns to trick good people into evil.

>> ##### The Korranberg Chronicle—No faith in Silver Flame top tyke
>>The nation of Thrane shocked the world in 993 YK when it appointed a six-year-old child as Keeper of the Silver Flame, the supreme leadership position of the Church. Now eleven years old, Jaela Daran continues to astound all who encounter her. She possesses poise and wisdom beyond her years, and she displays the blend of courage and compassion that is the cornerstone of the faith. As Keeper of the Flame, she wields tremendous divine power; she has summoned angels to her side and resurrected Cardinal Halidor after his assassination.
>>
>>But some claim that these stories are fabrications and that Jaela is merely a figurehead for High Cardinal Krozen. The reclusive Krozen is a brilliant strategist and ruthless leader. Many believe that Krozen was behind the death of Keeper Tagor in 992 YK, suggesting that he supported the child Keeper to solidify his own influence. Is Krozen the true power behind the Flame?
>>

A pillar of argent fire marks the point of Tira's sacrifice, the center of the modern church. This pillar, located in Flamekeep, is a manifestation of the Silver Flame, not the source of its power.

The church's templars stand ready to protect the innocent from supernatural threats, battling undead, fiends, and aberrations. Friars and ministers fight evil by doing good, performing acts of compassion and charity across Khorvaire. In contrast to the Sovereign Host, the church maintains a defined structure and creed. Archbishops monitor regions; cardinals lead the church; and the ultimate authority is the Keeper of the Flame, who maintains the font in Flamekeep and communes with Tira Miron.

The Last War had a serious impact on the church. Leaders still respected the Keeper's authority over spiritual matters, but the war wasn't about good or evil. Templars of all nations still joined together to fight demons, but if no supernatural threat was present, they fought for their own nations. This division allowed cracks to form in the foundation. In Breland, some priests fell prey to greed or forged ties to criminal organizations. In Aundair, a zealous faction known as the Pure Flame advocates using violence rather than compassion as the primary tool for rooting out evil. And in Thrane, the church has become the ruling body. While still driven by Tira's principles of redemption and sacrifice, the intrusion of politics means that some come to the faith seeking power rather than purely to do good.

In creating a follower of the Silver Flame, decide whether you are bound to the church or simply inspired by its principles. As a paladin, are you part of the templar order, or were you a farmer called to action by the Voice of the Silver Flame?

The Silver Flame is centered in Thrane, but it has a strong presence in Breland and Aundair, and followers across Khorvaire. Members of the Pure Flame sect treat some species—notably shifters and changelings—with suspicion, but the faith holds that people of all races should stand together.

### Symbol
The faith's symbol is a stylized flame inlaid with silver. A silver arrowhead etched with the symbol serves as a common token, worn as a necklace.

### Rites
The Silver Flame has no need of prayers or offerings; instead, services focus on the parishioners, encouraging virtuous behavior. Church hierarchy is strictly observed, and only ordained priests can perform services.

Archery is a devotional practice of the Silver Flame, used both as a means of meditation and a martial art. Communities devoted to the Flame engage in archery training, and villages have militias of peasant archers.

### Temples
Fortresses of the Silver Flame are designed to serve as templar garrisons and to provide sanctuary against supernatural threats. Churches feature enormous arches and open spaces. The sanctuary of a Flamic church has a mosaic floor with a flame burning at its center.

The seat of the religion is the Grand Cathedral in Flamekeep. Built around the site of Tira's sacrifice, this fortified temple is the size of a small city.

## Blood of Vol
- Everyone has a spark of divinity. Find that power within.
- Death is the end, Dolurrh is oblivion, and if the gods exist, they are cruel. Stand with those you care for; all we have is this life and each other.

>> ##### Voice of Breland—Corpse Cleric Condemns Claw
>>Last month, the Emerald Claw took credit for the ghoul outbreak in Wroat. This terrorist organization has a new and unusual critic: Hask Malevanor, an "abactor" of the Blood of Vol and high priest of the Crimson Monastery, a temple in the city of Atur in Karrnath. Something else you should know about Abactor Malevanor: he's been dead for over fifty years! This putrid priest says that there's nothing unholy about his condition, swearing that his people revere all life. Despite the fact that the terrorists included priests from his church, Malevanor insists that his parishioners despise the Emerald Claw and harbor no hostility toward Breland.
>>
>>While we'd like to take the abactor at his word, our research shows that Malevanor was personally involved in the program that produced the infamous Karrnathi undead soldiers. After decades of driving the Karrnathi war effort, this foul creature expects us to believe that he has nothing to do with the necromantic attacks on our people? Here at the *Voice of Breland*, we think something about this smells rotten, and it's not just the mummy.
>>

What just god would allow death and suffering? The Blood of Vol teaches that we all have the potential to become divine beings—and that death is a curse, designed to kill you before you can unlock the divinity within you.

The Blood of Vol is a grim faith, founded by Erandis d'Vol, an elf from Aerenal. It asserts that death is oblivion, that the universe is uncaring, and that if the Sovereigns exist, they are cruel. Its followers study the secrets of blood and life, and because they believe that death is the end, they see nothing wrong with using the bodies of the fallen to serve the living. Seekers of the Divinity Within (as the faithful call themselves) are glad to be reanimated after death; at least they can do some good.

Because of this association with necromancy, many believe the Blood of Vol embraces death and its followers want to become undead. Both ideas are false. The Blood of Vol sees death as the ultimate evil. Seekers don't want to become undead; they want to become divine beings. The faith teaches that divinity is tied to blood and soul, and the undead can never fully harness that power. The mummies and vampires of the Blood of Vol have sacrificed their chance at divinity to guide the living. They're martyrs, not something to envy.

In addition to a general revulsion toward the undead, the public opinion of the Blood of Vol is colored by the actions of the Order of the Emerald Claw. This extremist sect serves a lich known as the Queen of Death, and it employs necromantic magic in acts of terror. However, most Seekers don't support the Emerald Claw.

The Blood of Vol has its strongest following in Karrnath and the Lhazaar Principalities. For a time, it was the national religion of Karrnath. Though fallen from favor, the faith is still practiced openly in that nation.

### Symbol
The power of a cleric of the Blood of Vol comes from within them. As such, every cleric chooses a unique holy symbol—an object that resonates with them. More generally, the faith is represented by a tear-shaped red gemstone or shard of glass. Priests of the Blood of Vol wear robes of red and black.

### Rites
The services of the Blood of Vol focus on drawing the faithful together as a community and encouraging people to find power within themselves. The most important ritual of the faith is the Sacrament of Blood. After a sermon, each member of the congregation sheds a small amount of blood into a basin. This is a symbol of unity, and a message that members of the community would shed their blood to defend one another. In some temples, this blood is donated to vampire champions of the faith.

### Temples
A shrine devoted to the Blood of Vol requires only an altar and a means for collecting ritually spilled blood.

Temples of the Blood of Vol are fortified structures, built to serve as sanctuaries. In contrast to the Silver Flame, such temples are stark and functional. Temples include vaults or catacombs, designed to hold undead or to store corpses.

## Cults of the Dragon Below
- A paradise exists within the world, a vale bathed in the light of the Inner Sun. Earn your passage with the blood of worthy foes.
- Our existence is a chrysalis state, preparing us for transcendent immortality within the bowels of the gibbering mouther.
- The Lord of Eyes sees all secrets. Its gaze elevates the worthy and slays the unbeliever. Drive doubt from your heart, and you will see reality through new eyes.

>> ##### The Korranberg Chronicle—Raid Reveals Cult Chaos
>>The people of Fairhaven were shocked by the revelation of bizarre cult activity in the center of one of that city's most trusted institutions. Acting on a tip from the Royal Eyes of Aundair, elite forces raided a House Vadalis facility and discovered a nightmare. Captain Allis says that her soldiers discovered a beating heart that filled an entire room, pumping blood through veins in the walls of the building. According to Allis, the staff claimed to be "creating the heart of Galifar," apparently believing that if completed, this monstrosity could reunite the shattered kingdom.
>>
>>When pressed to comment, Patriarch Dalin d'Vadalis denied any connections to this cult. "These are difficult times for all of us. I assure you that House Vadalis will conduct a full investigation of this incident and work to regain the trust of the good people of Fairhaven."
>>

The Cults of the Dragon Below are wildly diverse. The tenets above describe the beliefs of three different cults. Warlocks draw power from demon overlords, and daelkyr cultists serve mind flayers and beholders. Others embrace deep convictions that others see as madness. Outsiders use the term "Cult of the Dragon Below" as a blanket term to describe these disparate beliefs, but the cultists don't use this name or see themselves as part of a greater whole.

Cults of the Dragon Below are based on madness or power. A cult that seeks power chooses to serve a dark force because of the gifts they receive from it. A cabal of scholars might serve the demon overlord **Sul Khatesh** in exchange for secrets of magic. In the Mror Holds, dwarf clans bargain with **Dyrrn** the Corruptor to gain symbionts and sinister gifts. The Shadow Marches contain cults devoted to the daelkyr **Belashyrra** and Kyrzin. Membership in such a cult is voluntary, and spellcasters are more likely to be warlocks or wizards than clerics; their power comes from bargaining, not from faith.

Cults driven by madness have a warped view of reality. A cultist might believe aberrations are a higher form of life and that the daelkyr will elevate mortals. Other cultists may not recognize the true nature of the beings they serve. A cult of **Rak Tulkhesh** might truly believe their lord will bring peace to the world, even if that peace must begin with bloody war. Joining such a cult isn't a choice, it's something you fall into due to madness. New cults can spring up anywhere, as seeds of madness take root and spread.

Cults of the Dragon Below often appear as antagonists. However, your character could be a member of a relatively benign cult. You might have been raised in a cult but broke free from its influence. If your character was or is part of a cult, work with your DM to develop the details of your sect.

### Symbol
Many cultists carry pieces of volcanic glass or small Khyber dragonshards (see *chapter 5*), but the cults have no unified symbol. Individual cults develop a symbol based on their fiendish patron or mad visions. Eyes, tentacles, and broken weapons are all common themes.

### Rites
Cult rituals are intense and often violent, including blood sacrifice and ritual combat. Many cultists consume unnatural substances, seeking a closer communion to aberrations. They perform rituals in Undercommon, though most cultists don't have a full understanding of the language.

### Temples
Cults meet underground, whether in caverns or sewers. Rural cults seek out places twisted by the powers of the plane of Xoriat (described in *chapter 4*) or Khyber.

## Path of Light
- We live in an age of darkness. We must find the path that leads to the light.
- Act with compassion and courage. Each noble act is a step on the path.
- Hone your body and your mind. You are the tool you will use to change reality.

Practiced by many kalashtar, the Path of Light seeks to change reality by first bringing change within, using meditation to focus the mind and athletic discipline to improve the body. The next step brings light into the world, using courage and compassion to banish the darkness in the people around you. Mediate disputes. Extinguish hatred by guiding people out of darkness. Inspire people to be better than they are. Even the smallest change is a victory, yet lightbringers—the followers of this path—hope that this is merely a step on a greater journey.

The Path of Light teaches that this age is dominated by il-Lashtavar, "the great darkness that dreams." This force poisons the world and promotes darkness. But all things change. If enough light can enter the world, it will lead to a tidal shift: the age of il-Lashtavar will end and usher in the time of il-Yannah, the great light.

Some followers of this faith believe that meditation alone is sufficient to change the path of the world, that merely contemplating the light is sufficient to bring about the change. Most believe that it is necessary to take action, but that darkness must fought with light. Violence is never the answer, and the only way to defeat evil is to redeem it. Lightbringers seek to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those whose evil is driven by ignorance. The faith has followed this path for over a thousand years, but now a splinter sect advocates greater action. These shadow watchers believe that evil must be fought, that sources of darkness that poison communities can and should be ruthlessly eliminated.

The Path of Light is taught to the kalashtar by the spirits bound to their bloodlines. It is widespread in the nation of Adar in distant Sarlona, but in Khorvaire, it is largely unknown outside kalashtar communities. The shadow watchers champion a sect born in Khorvaire, and the elders of Adar have condemned its methods.

If you follow the Path of Light, you must choose your side. As a lightbringer, you seek to spread hope and goodwill. As a shadow watcher, you hunt down and eliminate sources of darkness. Which path will you follow?

### Symbol
The symbol of the Path of Light is a shard of brilliant crystal, carried or worn as an amulet. This crystal may be used as a holy symbol; if it's worn as a necklace, the priest must place one hand on it to use it as a focus. The formal garb of a priest includes a headdress with curving horns and points made from a Sarlonan shell-like material called sentira.

### Rites
Physical and mental discipline are important virtues of the Path of Light. Martial arts and guided meditation become a form of devotion and prayer. A kalashtar priest conducts services telepathically, using shrines designed to amplify psychic abilities and allowing them to share thoughts and images directly with the congregation. To an outsider, a service can appear silent and tranquil despite being an ecstatic experience for the faithful.

### Temples
The nation of Adar in Sarlona is home to vast fortress monasteries devoted to the Path of Light. In Khorvaire, a mere handful of shrines appear in cities with large kalashtar communities. These shrines are calm and peaceful, the air scented with Sarlonan incense. The chambers are open, providing space for martial arts. Labyrinthine patterns engraved on the floors serve as an aid to meditation, while the walls hold crystals that focus and amplify the psychic abilities of the priests.

## Spirits of the Past
- We are the spiritual anchors of the greatest champions of our people. Through our faith, we keep their spirits from being lost to oblivion.
- You have been chosen by a hero. Live your life as they lived theirs, letting their instincts guide you.
- Treasure our past and the stories of our people. You are the vessel through which new legends will arise.

>> ##### Voice of Breland—The KaLashtar prophecy you can't ignore!
>>Many of the people of Khorvaire have never met a kalashtar. Some say these people are in contact with celestial spirits; here at the *Voice of Breland*, we say they're a rare type of lunatic we've imported from Sarlona. So it was a special treat for tourists when one of the spiritual leaders of the kalashtar of Sharn made an unexpected appearance in the grand plaza of Hope's Peak. The enlightened Havakhad—that's what he calls himself—issued a warning that "darkness was gathering" and that "a terrible time lies just ahead." He beseeched the assembled crowds to show kindness to neighbor and stranger alike, and not to let "fear cause strife in the hard days to come." Apparently Havakhad hasn't heard the news that we're winning the war. But if the world does end tomorrow, you read it here first!
>>

As a Tairnadal elf of Valenar, you were raised on the legends of your people, on tales of champions who battled mighty dragons and armies of giants. When you came of age, the Keepers of the Past read the signs to determine which of these ancestors chose you to be their vessel. Since that day, it has been your duty to emulate your patron ancestor. If you're a wizard, you've studied the spells created by your ancestor. If you're a warrior, you've practiced their specific martial techniques. When you trance, you relive their greatest battles. But these studies are just preparation. Now it's your sacred duty to be a revenant of your ancestor: to live your life as they did and allow the champion to walk the world again through you. (This title of revenant carried by Speakers of the Past is not to be confused with the undead revenants described in the *Monster Manual*.)

The bond between ancestor and living elf is holy. Your ancestor doesn't speak to you or control your actions. But as a Tairnadal, you believe that they are with you—that your instincts and your reflexes are the ancestor moving through you, telling you what to do. The closer you follow the path, the more guidance they provide, helping you create new legends.

The folk of Khorvaire see your people as mercenaries and conquerors. But you don't care about gold or personal glory. All you want is to let your ancestors live again, and that means you need to perform deeds worthy of champions. That drives you now: seeking out adventures that will add to the legends of your patron.

You and your DM should develop the identity of your ancestor. How did they fight? What were some of their legendary deeds? Did they have a distinctive weapon or favor a particular kind of magic? Equally important is your relationship with the ancestor. Are you proud of your ancestor and excited to live as they did, or is your duty a burden?

Since the rise of Valenar, half-elves and even some humans have sought to be inducted into the faith. But so far the Keepers of the Past have declared that only elves can be revenants. Beyond the blood connection to the ancestor, an elf communes with their ancestor during trance, and half-elves can't enter this state. The Keepers say it can't be done, but perhaps you'll be the one to prove them wrong.

### Symbol
The primary symbol of the faith is the zaelshin, an amulet that bears the seal of your patron ancestor and worn either as a brooch or embedded in the forehead of a helmet. A devotee of the faith typically wears a veil—the zaelta, or "spirit mask"—over their lower face while in battle or performing rituals, so an opponent sees the zaelshin rather than the living elf.

The zaelshin is the symbol of the faith, but the holy symbol used by a cleric is an object associated with their personal ancestor.

### Rites
Services revolve around the stories of the ancestors, commemorating their glorious deeds, as well as ritual exercises and trance meditation. While resting, an elf spends four hours in trance. The faithful spend this time in communion with their ancestor, experiencing their memories and contemplating their deeds.

### Temples
The nomadic Tairnadal elves don't raise permanent temples. A Keeper of the Past marks a circle on the ground with their blade, and the space within becomes sanctified for the service.

## Undying Court
- Our greatest champions and sages will never be lost to us. Their wisdom guides us, and their power protects us all.
- Honor our past. Respect our traditions. Perfect your skills and you may earn your place among the Deathless.
- Destroy those foul creatures that channel the power of Mabar, for they consume the essence of our world.

The elves of Aerenal refuse to let their greatest souls be lost to the oblivion that is Dolurrh. The wisest and most accomplished elves are preserved after death, becoming members of the Undying Court. The devotion of the living elves sustains the Undying Court, and the Court generates a well of mystic energy that empowers their clerics. As an Aereni cleric, your spells aren't personally granted to you by a specific Undying Councilor. Your powers flow from the Court itself, allowing you to serve its will and to protect your people.

Of all the religions of Eberron, the Undying Court is most grounded in the world. The Court stands in the city of Shae Mordai, and as an Aerenal elf, you could seek an audience with one of your deathless ancestors. As a devotee of the Undying Court, you recognize it as the power that sustains your civilization and as an assembly of your greatest sages and leaders. Should you accomplish great achievements in your life, you can aspire to join the Court.

As a cleric or paladin of the Undying Court, you have a concrete relationship with your deity. In creating your character, consider why you've traveled so far from home. Are you on a specific mission? Are you serving the Court as a whole, or are you acting as an agent of a specific councilor—perhaps your own ancestor? The Undying Court despises undead creatures that prey on the living, so if you don't have a concrete mission, you can always hunt down undead and evil necromancers.

### Symbol
The symbol of the Undying Court is a golden mask with luminous eyes, worn over the face while a priest is carrying out their duties. Devotees wear a smaller mask as a brooch or amulet.

### Rites
The most sacred rite of the Undying Court is trance communion. While in trance, an Aereni elf engages in meditation that connects them to the gestalt consciousness of the Court. This experience affirms the place of the individual as part of the greater whole.

Since trance communion is a personal experience, the role of the priest is to provide spiritual and practical guidance to their congregation. A masked priest serves as the face of the Court, and any elf can approach them seeking an ease to their burdens.

### Temples
In Aerenal, the temples of the Undying Court are step pyramids built from stone. In Khorvaire, shrines to the Court use imported Aereni densewood, a particularly tough lumber that grows only on the island. Regardless of form, the walls are engraved with stories about the Undying Councilors that serve as the particular patrons of the temple, usually those related to the local priests.

![[095-2-17.png|right|300]](Oalian of the Towering Wood)

## Druids of Khorvaire

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—It happened in the FOrest: Tree Hugger Tell-All!
>>The alliance of rebel farmers in western Aundair has declared an alliance with the Great Druid Oalian of the Towering Wood, asserting that the farmlands that border these woods are now part of the Eldeen Reaches. The Great Druid is a figure of legend, a powerful mystic who serves as the spiritual leader of a diverse range of druids spread across the region. Another interesting fact about Oalian? He's a tree! Some say he's a child of Eberron herself, while others assert that he's the spirit of an ancient druid trapped in tree form. Whatever the truth, the Great Druid Oalian appears as a massive greatpine in a grove called Greenheart, deep in the Towering Wood.
>>

- We, the Ashbound, are the champions of the natural world. We defend it from anything and anyone who threatens it.
- We, the Children of Winter, preserve the natural cycle of life and death. Disease and decay cull the weak and strengthen the whole. We must destroy undead and ensure that the cycle continues.
- We, the Gatekeepers, protect the natural world from the forces that come from outside it, from those beings that slither in from the darkness beyond.
- We, the Greensingers, celebrate the magic in the natural world, as well as the fey that embody that magic. We serve as ambassadors between the fey and mortals, protecting each from the other.
- We, the Wardens of the Wood, protect all the children of Eberron, from the beasts of the wild to the people of the cities. We preserve the balance between nature and civilization and help each understand the other.

All druids look after the natural world, but they act in different ways. Five well-established paths define most of Khorvaire's druids. In creating a druid character, consider whether you have ties to one of these traditions, and what led you to leave your order. Are you on a mission? Are you exploring the world? Have you been banished, with good reason or otherwise?

### Ashbound
The Ashbound defend the natural world from anything that threatens it. Some Ashbound consider civilization to be a threat and strike at any settlement that encroaches on the wild. Others focus their wrath on the dragonmarked houses or seek to free bound elementals.

### Children of Winter
The Children of Winter believe that death and decay are vital aspects of the natural cycle of life. They believe that if the cycle falls out of balance, it will trigger a devastating cataclysm as the world resets this balance. They battle undead, but they also engage in actions that cull the weak. Extremists have been known to spread plagues in cities. The Children of Winter are particularly interested in unraveling the mystery of the Mourning, as some of them believe it is a sign of the apocalypse they fear.

### Gatekeepers
The Gatekeepers are one of the oldest sects, primarily found among the orcs of the Shadow Marches. They act to protect Eberron from aberrations and other unnatural creatures and seek to prevent extraplanar incursions and attacks. The Gatekeepers maintain ancient seals that hold long-forgotten evils at bay.

### Greensingers
The Greensingers are devoted to the fey, and serve as mediators between the fey and mortals. The ranks of the Greensingers include bards as well as warlocks with Archfey patrons; a druid or ranger might also serve a specific archfey.

### Wardens of the Wood
The Wardens of the Wood believe that civilization has a place in the world. As a warden, you help others understand nature, ensuring that they don't cause unintentional harm or stumble into danger. Wardens serve as militia and mediators in the Eldeen Reaches. This is the largest of the druidic sects and the most recognized.

# Chapter 3: Sharn, City of Towers
*I've been here a week, and it's still hard not to feel overwhelmed by the city. The towers rise up until they disappear into the clouds. Lights gleam in a thousand windows. Skycoaches work their way through the maze of bridges connecting the towers, and up above I can see the burning ring of an elemental airship.**Distracted by the sights in the sky, I nearly walk into a warforged as it brushes past me. It's my first time seeing one, but then there are so many things I've never seen in this place. Over there, a tattooed elf haggles with a masked halfling, arguing about the price of lizard meat. Beyond them, a gargoyle watches from a high perch. I gather my senses and keep moving.**It's not until I reach the lift that I realize the warforged stole my purse.*— A newcomer to the big cityAll the major themes of Eberron are manifest in the great city of Sharn. It's a place of magic, with skycoaches circling mile-high towers and mystic forges toiling endlessly in the bowels. It's a place of adventure and intrigue. A fallen angel is gathering minions in the ruins below the city. A gang war is gaining strength in Callestan. The corpse of a murdered aristocrat has just been discovered in a floating mansion. A Cannith artificer is experimenting with a planar gateway—and something is about to go terribly wrong. All of these adventures and a hundred more are waiting in the City of Towers.

This chapter details the city for players and DMs alike. The DM can find additional information about the city in *chapter 4*.

![[096-3-01.jpg|right|300]](An illusory dragon roars as flying ships zoom among the skyscrapers of Sharn at night)

## The Shape of Sharn
Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire, with a population of half a million people. Humans make up about a third of that number, and dwarves are a sixth of it; the rest is a blend of every race found across Khorvaire. Halflings, elves, and gnomes all have a significant presence in the city, but even kalashtar and changelings have communities in Sharn. Beyond the permanent population, tens of thousands of people pass through Sharn every day. Refugees from the war still find their way to the city, along with tourists, spies, merchants, and folk hoping to find their fortune in the grandest city in Eberron.

Sharn stands above the Dagger River and its eastern tributary, the Hilt. It's an important port for anyone dealing with Aerenal, Xen'drik, or Sarlona. Mountains line the shores of the Dagger, and Sharn can't spread out. So instead it has grown ever upward.

The city is primarily made up of these quarters:

- Central Plateau
- Dura
- Menthis Plateau
- Northedge
- Tavick's Landing

At the hub of each of these quarters is a cluster of enormous core towers. A web of bridges and platforms connects many of these vast spires, and smaller turrets sprout from the edges of the core towers. The district of Skyway floats above the highest towers, while the tunnels of the Cogs stretch out below the lower city.

In between those extremes, each of the quarters is divided into an upper ward, a middle ward, and a lower ward. Each ward is made up of a number of districts, so that the location of a place in Sharn can be expressed with a combination of a ward name and a district name. More information about each of the wards and the districts in them appears later in this chapter.

### Aftermath of War
Far from the front lines, Sharn never fell under siege during the Last War. Regardless, the war's impacts affected the city's citizens and continue to even today.

#### Physical Damage
Although Sharn was never subjected to a sustained assault, it didn't avoid damage. On many occasions, commandos and saboteurs launched significant attacks inside Sharn. The most infamous of these was the Aundairian attack that brought down the floating Glass Tower, devastating the district now known as Fallen. In any of the lower or middle wards, you might encounter evidence of the conflict in the form of a shattered bridge, a building collapsed by an arcane explosion, or an area some say is haunted because of the large number of people killed there during the war.

#### Psychological Scars
There are places in the city that house people who suffered because of the actions of other nations. For example, many of the residents of Dura hold all Aundairians responsible for the destruction of Fallen. In another district, folk could hate the Karrns for an undead attack that occurred during the war, and a different group could blame Thrane for the siege of Vathirond. These kinds of sentiments can shape the feelings of an entire district, but in the city as a whole there are far more people who have personal burdens to carry than those who feel resentment toward particular nations. For instance, on an individual level, most members of the Sharn Watch might not care about a gnoll being seen in a neighborhood, but a guard who fought on the Droaam front during the war might be out for revenge. Warforged are sometimes also the targets of this sort of prejudice; a person whose friends were killed by warforged soldiers might resent all such creatures.

#### Shortages
Because the ink is barely dry on the Treaty of Thronehold and relationships between the signatories are still being normalized, Sharn doesn't currently benefit from a lot of commerce with other nations. Problems could arise from a short supply of any imported goods, whether this manifests as inflated prices, the need for rationing, or certain items being simply unavailable. The factors of supply and demand also play into smuggling and the black market; some desirable goods might be available only through the Boromar Clan.

#### Refugees and Victims
Cyran refugees have filled the district of High Walls in Lower Tavick's Landing beyond capacity, and Sharn is also home to a significant number of refugees from elsewhere in Breland—people whose homes and villages were destroyed during the war, and who have come to Sharn in search of new lives. The city also has its share of other people harmed during the war, soldiers and civilians with severe physical or psychological injuries. All these folk are most likely to be found in the lower wards. They aren't just poor; they're suffering—and they might seek vengeance against those they blame for their pain.

## Guide to the City
![[097-3-02.png|right|300]]

*When you live on the inside low, you never see the sun. People hear "towers," they think of graceful little spires, the sort of thing you see poking up in the corner of your lord's keep. We've got those, and lots of 'em. But the foundation of the city is the core towers. The walls of these towers are so thick you could fit your lord's castle in one.**You've got your outside districts where you get the open air, built on the bridges and platforms that connect the core towers together. You've got the little turrets, built on the core tower walls and the bridges between. You've got the folk in the middle, who live and work in the walls themselves. And then you've got those of us on the inside, our districts entirely contained in the hollow well of a great tower. When you look up in Callestan, you see twinkling lights, to be sure. But those aren't stars, and that isn't the sky. You're looking up through a mile of bridges and platforms crossing the well, looking up at the districts above you.**You live up high, you can touch the sky. In the middle you can still see the sun. Down on the inside low, all we have is gloom and the constant drip, water and worse descending from the city above us.*— A street urchin describing SharnSharn is the most cosmopolitan city on the continent. Describing all the activities and offerings in the city could fill an entire book. Here's a summary of what you need to know to appreciate the city to the fullest.

### Watch Your Step!

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Watch for Falling Drunks
>>Just this week a Brelish woman in Middle Central was squashed to death when a drunk Cyran man fell on her from the upper wards. He survived. A good Brelish woman, a veteran of the Last War, cushioned his fall!
>>
>>This incident isn't the first of its kind. Last month a clumsy warforged crushed two innocent halfling lovers. Before that, a shifter thief fell from a tower, injuring an unsuspecting griffon. I propose a new law: No traveling the middle or upper wards without a feather token. These affordable trinkets are all that stand between our safety and death caused by some rat who would rather spend gold on drink.
>>

As befits the City of Towers, Sharn is also a city of bridges and balconies. These thoroughfares and outcroppings can be extremely narrow or comfortably wide. Although most of them are bounded by walls or railings, there's always a chance that during your time in Sharn, you or someone you know will go over the edge. So, how do residents cope with this risk?

Those who can afford it usually carry a *feather token* as insurance. No token? Don't panic! Because of the maze of bridges and spans connecting the towers, there's an excellent chance that you won't fall more than a hundred feet before impacting on a lower bridge. Though this alone might seem like small comfort, it's also true that the major bridges in the upper and middle wards are enchanted with *feather fall* effects that trigger automatically, keeping you from crushing an innocent passerby in your descent.

Many different outcomes could follow a lengthy fall. The Falling in Sharn table presents a few possibilities.

##### Falling in Sharn
| d8 | Result |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | You fall hundreds of feet before striking the ground at the base of the towers. |
| 2 | You fall 3d6 × 10 feet before striking a bridge. A major bridge in an upper or a middle ward will have a *feather fall* enchantment; otherwise, it's going to be a hard landing. |
| 3 | You fall 2d4 × 10 feet and land in a passing skycoach, possibly injuring a passenger. |
| 4 | You fall 4d4 × 5 feet and strike an outcropping, flagpole, or projecting statue. If you survive, you're still precariously perched on the edge of a tower or bridge. |
| 5 | You fall past a **hippogriff**—make a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to catch its leg! |
| 6 | A **gargoyle** or **giant owl** catches you—then threatens to drop you if it doesn't get a reward. |
| 7 | You can fly! Actually, a nearby wizard or artificer casts *feather fall* to save you, but for a moment it felt like you can fly. And now the spellcaster wants payment. |
| 8 | You strike a small **air elemental** that was drawn to the city. Doing this cushions your fall, but now you're on top of an air elemental. |

### Communication Services
Need to get a message to someone? If you're not in a hurry, the Orien post has boxes throughout the city; you can mail a letter for 1 cp. Hiring a courier generally costs between 5 cp and 5 gp, depending on the size of the package and where you need it delivered. You can find Sivis message stations in almost every upper and middle ward, and if you absolutely have to contact someone instantly, the Sivis enclave in the Dragon Towers district (Middle Central) can perform a *sending* spell for 200 gp.

House Tharashk has brought an innovation to message delivery in Sharn: the use of **gargoyles**. Tharashk has several of these creatures in its employ, and these flying couriers are a quick way to get a message across the city. If you spot a gargoyle without a burden, you can flag it down, and it costs 5 gp to deliver a letter or a small package.

### Spellcasting Services
Magewrights and adepts can be found in every district of Sharn, selling their services. Standard prices are summarized on the Magewright Casting Fees table.

##### Magewright Casting Fees
| Spell Level | Price |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | 25 gp |
| 2nd | 50 gp |
| 3rd | 100 gp |

These costs can vary depending on the spell and the spellcaster, and they don't include the price of expensive components. People who can cast higher-level spells are rare, typically found only in the dragonmarked houses or the wizard circles; the cost and availability of such services varies based on the caster.

> ##### Lifestyle and Standards of Living
>In Sharn, as in any large community, different segments of the population occupy different places in the economic spectrum. The terms that D&D uses to quantify lifestyle expenses—wretched, squalid, poor, modest, comfortable, wealthy, and aristocratic (see "*Expenses*" in chapter 5 of the *Player's Handbook*)—are also used in this chapter as an indicator of what it costs for someone to live in a given area, and also of the costs of goods and services there.
>
>For instance, a restaurant that is said to serve food of comfortable quality is one where a patron who lives a comfortable lifestyle (or better) can afford anything on the menu.
>

### Education and Research
Morgrave University, though not the most respectable institution of higher learning in Khorvaire, has an extensive library that boasts definitive collections of lore in certain fields, particularly arcana, dungeoneering, geography, and history. Characters seeking knowledge in any of these fields or others ought to be able to find resources in the library to aid their search. The university is an excellent source of sages who hire their services out on a short- or long-term basis. Even those who profess to be sages but have no connection to the university tend to cluster around Morgrave, with their homes and businesses almost all located in the University, Den'iyas, and Ivy Towers districts of Upper Menthis.

Another important site for certain kinds of research is the City Archive, in the Highest Towers district of Upper Central. The archive contains exhaustive historical documents of Sharn; birth, death, and marriage records; and copies of legal documents such as identification papers and letters of marque issued in the city. Access to these records, however, is more restricted than to the contents of the Morgrave library.

Those who want to further their research through some hands-on experience might find undiscovered lore in the lowest regions of Sharn, where sewers and tunnels snake through ancient ruins. Similarly, the crypts of the City of the Dead might hold some relevant historical information.

### Shopping Centers
Sharn contains a number of major shopping districts. The Tradefair district in Middle Central focuses on top-quality goods—everything you'll need to maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle. North Market in Lower Northedge has a fine selection of common goods. Almost anything can be found in the Bazaar of Middle Dura, as long as you're not concerned about the origin of secondhand goods. Tavick's Market in Middle Tavick's Landing is a center for produce and other goods brought in from the farms and artisan workshops outside Sharn.

### Healing
House Jorasco operates houses of healing throughout the city, largely in the middle and upper wards. The Panaceum in Dragon Towers (Middle Central) is the primary Jorasco enclave. The houses' services use the prices in this book's introduction.

The Panaceum has an altar that can be used to perform *raise dead*, but this service isn't without its risks. Sometimes the wrong spirit returns to a body, or malevolent ghosts or wraiths might escape from the netherworld along with the person being raised. Before the healers take gold to perform a resurrection, a Jorasco adept will first cast *augury*. If this divination indicates looming disaster, the adept will reject the request.

A few divine spellcasters in Sharn can raise the dead, notably the high priest of the Undying Court in Shae Lias. These devout clerics rarely sell their services, however, and the high priest would need a compelling reason to help someone who has different beliefs.

### Holidays
There's always a celebration happening or about to happen in Sharn, whether it's a parade in a single district or a festival that ranges across the entire city. Here are a few special occasions to put on your calendar.

#### The Tain Gala (First Far of each month)
The ir'Tains are the richest and most powerful family in Sharn. Each month, Lady Celyria ir'Tain holds a ball at her Skyway mansion. The guest list defines the current social order of the city; those families who hold permanent invitations, known as the Sixty, are the de facto royalty of Sharn. Celyria does invite unusual guests and attractions each month, and an up-and-coming entertainer or a renowned folk hero might catch her notice.

#### Crystalfall (9 Olarune)
During the Last War, saboteurs caused a floating tower to fall into Lower Dura. This devastation can still be seen today in the district now known as Fallen. On 9 Olarune, people gather to remember those who were lost that day. Many of them carry on a tradition of crafting elaborate ice sculptures and throwing them into the Dagger River.

#### The Day of Mourning (20 Olarune)
The nation of Cyre was destroyed in 994 YK on this date, known as the Day of Mourning. Although that event had an impact on everyone in Khorvaire, this day of remembrance is especially significant to Cyran survivors. It is a time when Cyrans come together to recall their lost kingdom. Some tell stories or sing traditional songs, ensuring that their culture isn't forgotten. Other survivors still seethe with anger at the enemies who brought Cyre down, and thus far the holiday has been marked by a brief upturn in violence.

#### Sun's Blessing (15 Therendor)
The festival of Dol Arrah is a day of peace and a time when enemies are urged to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts. It's one of the safest days in the city for visitors and residents alike.

#### Aureon's Crown (26 Dravago)
Elders share their knowledge with the young during this celebration. Morgrave University holds its graduate services on this day, and a day-long schedule of public lectures is presented at the Great Hall of Aureon in Upper Menthis.

#### Brightblade (12 Nymm)
The festival of Dol Dorn is noted across the city with prizefights, wrestling matches, archery contests, and other tests of strength and skill. This activity culminates with a grand contest of champions in the Cornerstone district in Middle Tavick's Landing.

#### The Race of Eight Winds (23 Lharvion)
This event is an aerial race that takes place around Dura Quarter.

#### The Hunt (4 Barrakas)
In honor of the Sovereign Balinor, a fierce beast is brought to the city and released on this day into an isolated section of Old Sharn. Anyone can participate in the Hunt by making a donation of 5 gp; the hunter (or group) who brings down the beast wins a purse of 500 gp and the blessing of Balinor. The motif of the Hunt can vary; in some years, multiple beasts are released, and the hunter who catches the most of them is the victor. In any case, it often turns out that the other competitors are a greater threat to hunters than the beasts they stalk.

#### Fathen's Fall (25 Barrakas)
This celebration commemorates a priest of the Silver Flame who was martyred while exposing lycanthropes in Sharn. The day's activities often cause tension with the shifter community.

#### Boldrei's Feast (9 Rhaan)
Gatherings across the city mark this celebration of community. The wealthy compete to throw the grandest parties, and the most generous among them will be remembered throughout the year for their largesse.

#### The Ascension (1 Sypheros)
The sacrifice of Tira Miron, who gave her life to serve as the Voice of the Silver Flame, is honored on this day. The holiday is marked by services at all Silver Flame churches and shrines, and the faithful are encouraged to find some way to help their communities.

#### Wildnight (18–19 Sypheros)
Supposedly the Fury, the god of Passion and Revenge, reaches the height of her power on this night. Emotions run high, and impulse control runs low. Shy and superstitious folk stay indoors, while others see it as a time to cast aside inhibitions. The streets fill with revelry that lasts well into the night.

#### Thronehold (11 Aryth)
This observance marks the day that the Treaty of Thronehold was signed, officially ending the Last War. This year (998 YK) is only the second time the event has been commemorated, and the Lord Mayor of Sharn has promised a truly epic festival.

#### Long Shadows (26–28 Vult)
It's said that the power of the Shadow, the sinister deity of the Dark Six, is at its height during these three nights. Careful people spend this time indoors with friends, but those who relish the darkness might decide to take to the streets to prey on the weak and foolish.

### Sports and Games

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—the Race of Eight Winds Begins!
>>Banners are flying across Dura today, and the streets are full of color. Walk through Oldkeep wearing brown and red, and you'll be invited to raise a glass to the Griffon; if you're dressed in white and gold, the colors of the Hippogriff, you'd best be prepared to defend yourself.
>>
>>If you're new to Sharn, you might think our city's gone mad. And in some ways it has, but it's a madness that reaches its peak every summer with the Race of Eight Winds. Long ago, King Galifar used Dura as a proving ground for aerial calvary. What's more important, quickness or strength? Our modern race is a test of speed and skill through a course that weaves around and through the spires of Dura. There are eight competitors, and each of these brave jockeys rides a different flying creature—except for the gargoyle Carralag, who relies on his own wings!
>>
>>Speed is important, but merely surviving the race can be a challenge. The spilling of blood isn't prohibited, but the only weapon a rider can carry is a light sporting crossbow; the steeds can use their talons and beaks, which is what makes the Griffon such a fierce contender. Poison, magic, or anything else that would directly interfere with beast or rider is strictly forbidden—though over the years we've certainly seen imaginative attempts to stretch the rules!
>>
>>Dura is divided into eight regions for the race, each of which is represented by a different creature. If you're going to spend time in Dura, it's best that you know your mounts! The beasts of Upper Dura are the fastest in the race, and overall have the best record. The reigning champion is the Pegasus of Highwater, whose supporters wear white and silver. The Hippogriff is tied to Overlook and Daggerwatch in Upper Dura, and its colors are white and gold. Detractors often say that the Sharn Watch favors the Hippogriff and that House Vadalis helps the Pegasus, but the referees always insist that the race is fair.
>>
>>The beasts of Middle Dura are versatile. The Eagle represents Broken Arch and Stormhold in Middle Dura, and its supporters wear brown and gold. The clever Owl flies for Rattlestone and the Bazaar, and its colors are brown and gray. The Hawk represents Tumbledown and Underlook in Middle Dura, and wearing its blend of tan and brown can usually get you a good price at an inn.
>>
>>The beasts of Lower Dura are more infamous than reliable. The Griffon flies for Precarious and Oldkeep, and its colors are brown and red. It has never won the race, but there's gold to be made betting on which opponent it will bring down. The Glidewing represents Gate of Gold and The Stores, and its supporters wear green and gray; many believe that the Boromar Clan pays for the upkeep of the mount and its rider. Malleon's Gate used to be represented by the Bat, but twelve years ago they exchanged that mascot for the Gargoyle, whose colors are black and gray. The current **Gargoyle** is a stone-faced fellow named Carralag, and his supporters are quite passionate about their winged champion.
>>

As befits a metropolis that boasts people of all cultures, Sharn hosts a wide variety of sports and athletic events. The Race of Eight Winds occurs once a year. Other events take place on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. For instance, shifters hold informal hrazhak competitions every night in Lower Northedge. The ogres of the Cogs are fond of tugs-of-war, arm wrestling, and similarly simple tests of strength. People who want to bet on sports can usually find a gambler willing to set odds in the Firelight district in Lower Menthis, Callestan in Lower Dura, Cornerstone in Middle Tavick's Landing, or Hareth's Folly in Middle Dura. Three exotic sports practiced in the city are described below.

#### Hrazhak
Two teams of seven shifters play hrazhak on a field with a goal at each end. Each team starts out carrying a wooden idol. To score, a team must steal its opponent's idol and place both idols in its own goal. Obstacles such as trees, streams, and piles of rubble can be present on a hrazhak field, requiring the competitors to make full use of their jumping and climbing abilities. Idols can be thrown or carried, and there are no limits on contact between participants, although only natural weapons are allowed. Typically, a low-level druid or adept is on hand to provide healing if needed—but any competitor who receives aid is removed from play for the remainder of the match. Competitors aren't allowed to use spells or similar abilities.

The only formal hrazhak arena in Sharn is located in the Stone Trees, part of the Cornerstone district, where the matches serve as both a spectator sport and a reason for gambling. Shifters created temporary hrazhak fields in the slums and warehouse districts of the city from time to time, and shifter youths often play impromptu games in the parks.

#### Skyblades
Common jousting is popular enough throughout Breland, but in Sharn, the sport has taken to the air. In a formal skyblades match, the goal is to knock an opposing rider from the saddle—attacks against mounts are forbidden, along with the use of magic or other supernatural abilities. Formal matches take place in one of Sharn's two aerial arenas, in Cornerstone and Hareth's Folly. Skyblades jousters typically ride **hippogriffs** and carry blunted lances that deal nonlethal damage.

Informal matches, which don't always use the same rules, occur from time to time in Lower and Middle Dura, Tavick's Landing, and Menthis Plateau. An informal match might be played out across an entire district, with competitors weaving between towers and around bridges. The rules for an informal match are set before the start, establishing (among other things) whether magic can be used and mounts can be targeted.

#### Six Stones
A Droaam tradition brought to Sharn by immigrants, six stones is a game for seven competitors, who each pay a base stake. The seven are then sealed in a large chamber with a **cockatrice**. The match ends when six of the players have been turned to stone, at which point the survivor is awarded all the stakes (except for a share set aside for the organizers). A **medusa** handler monitors the competition to ensure that rules are followed. Contestants carry no arms or armor, and no magic or supernatural abilities may be used. Additionally, no one is allowed to attack the cockatrice. The challenge lies in outlasting the other contestants and luring them or pushing them into the path of the cockatrice. The battleground might be barren or littered with rubble and cover; it might be lit, or it could be be pitch black.

Six stones matches are staged by the criminal organization Daask (see the "*Criminal Activities*" section later in this chapter). The sport is illegal, but the games go on because the matches are confined to Lower Dura and the Cogs and well hidden from the eyes of the Watch. A match usually occurs only once every few months. Sometimes participants voluntarily enter the competition, but most are debtors who have been offered a chance to pay off their loans by winning the match. Daask takes bets on the outcome, and usually earns a tidy sum as its share of the proceeds.

### City Government
Sharn has many people in positions of power: beadles, ministers, bailiffs, and all manner of minor functionaries and officials. But ultimate power rests in the hands of the City Council. That body has seventeen members: one for each ward in the city, plus representatives from Skyway and the Cogs. Each ward has its own process for selecting a councilor, and there are no legal restrictions on who can govern; if you build up a strong base of support in a ward, you could hold the position yourself!

The members of the City Council are quite diverse. Some are crooked, others are idealists, and one of them appears to be an owl. All of them are well known in their home wards, and any of them could have use for a team of adventurers. The Sharn Councilors table describes a few of the city leaders you might bump into in Upper Central or at the Tain Gala. If your character has the noble background, you might already know one of them.

##### Sharn Councilors
| d12 | Councilor |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Sorik Sensos** (human) represents Middle Central. An elder statesman and a brilliant orator, he is rumored to be involved in a web of bribery and graft. |
| 2 | **Sava Kharisa** (human) is the outspoken councilor from Lower Central. Since taking her seat, she has fought to improve conditions for the lower classes of Sharn, and she has made many enemies on the council and beyond. |
| 3 | **Thurik Davandi** (gnome) represents Upper Menthis. He is known to have ties to Zilargo and the Boromar Clan, and reportedly loves intrigues and blackmail. |
| 4 | **Savia Potellas** (human) has her hand in the entertainment industry of Lower Menthis. She hopes to reduce the influence of organized crime in her district, but it's a dangerous game. |
| 5 | **Maza Thadian** (elf) represents Upper Northedge. A venerable elf and owner of one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, she fights to maintain tradition but definitely puts the needs of the wealthy ahead of the poor. |
| 6 | **Shassa Tarr** (shifter), from Lower Northedge, represents the interests of the merchants and shifters of her ward. She is a cunning diplomat and devoted to her constituents. |
| 7 | **Bestan ir'Tonn** (halfling) has represented Upper Tavick's Landing for thirty years, and largely views his ward as a separate city within the city. He has a reputation for stirring up conflict and setting the other councilors against one another. |
| 8 | **Kilk** (changeling) represents the merchants of Lower Tavick's Landing. Whispered rumors suggest that the changeling has ties to the mysterious Tyrants. Some insist that Kilk is actually an identity shared by a group of changelings. |
| 9 | **Hruitt** (owl) is a **giant owl** who can assume human form. A former aerial racer, he's a clever negotiator who fights for the good of the Bazaar and Middle Dura, often opposing the Boromar Clan and its allies. |
| 10 | **Ilyra Boromar** (halfling) is the councilor for Lower Dura, but it's common knowledge that her true allegiance is to her family and its criminal empire. The current ongoing conflict with Daask has weakened her family and her position. |
| 11 | **Evix ir'Marasha** (human) represents Skyway. Lady Marasha owns the Celestial Vista restaurant, along with several other valuable businesses. She's an eloquent speaker who supports many radical positions, including abolishing the monarchy after the death of King Boranel and recognizing Sharn as an independent province. |
| 12 | **Nolan Toranak** (dwarf), the councilor for the Cogs, is largely seen as a tool of the industrialists who own the foundries there. Members of his family were killed by warforged during the Last War, and Toranak harbors a bitter grudge against House Cannith and the warforged. He has tried to have warforged reclassified as property, and seeks to suppress warforged activists in the Cogs. |

### Temples and Shrines
Every major religion has outposts in Sharn. A number of sacred sites draw pilgrims to the city from across Breland and Khorvaire. Priests don't usually sell their services; temples are places for worship and spiritual guidance.

The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Breland, represented by shrines and small temples throughout the city. The Pavilion of the Host in Middle Central is the heart of the faith, and most priests of the Host live in one of the Pavilion's nine towers. Pilgrims often come to visit one of three particular sites. The Korranath in Upper Central features Khorvaire's largest temple of Kol Korran. The Great Hall of Aureon in Upper Menthis draws scholars and worshipers alike. The Pool of Onatar's Tears in the Blackbones district of the Cogs is said to impart a blessing to any smith who bathes their hands in its waters.

The Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame, Sharn's largest temple to the Silver Flame, is located in Upper Central. Archierophant Ythana Morr is frequently accused of corruption and nepotism, but there are smaller places of worship around the city devoted to the true principles of the faith. The hermit Gaia watches over the City of the Dead from Warden Tower. Coldflame Keep in Middle Northedge was once a mighty garrison; its glory has faded, but Flamebearer Mazin Tana still strives to protect his community. The priestess Faela maintains a small shrine in the shadows of Fallen, doing what she can to help the wretched people of that forsaken district. Finally, the Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is a sacred site in North Market, often visited by templars passing through the city.

Even some lesser known religions are represented in Sharn. The Graystone district in Middle Tavick's Landing is a haven for followers of the Blood of Vol. The Gates of Passage in Upper Northedge is a temple of the Undying Court. The Overlook district of Upper Dura holds the Shrine of il-Yannah, dedicated to the Path of Light.

### Guilds and Groups
Guilds and similar associations abound in Sharn. Their headquarters are places where people can find the company of fellow professionals, or perhaps enlist the assistance of an organization.

All the guilds associated with the dragonmarked houses are well represented in Sharn; most have guildhalls in the Dragon Towers district of Middle Central. Aside from those groups, the city features a number of less populous associations, such as those described below.

#### Adventurer's Guilds
Sharn is a magnet for those who seek adventure and opportunity. Forgotten treasures are hidden in the ruins below the towers, and expeditions leave for Xen'drik every day. At any moment, dozens of sages, spies, and nobles around the city are searching for capable agents to help with their schemes and investigations. If you and your friends are searching for adventure, you've come to the right place, and you don't have to do it alone. Sharn is home to two organizations that provide adventurers with opportunities for work and camaraderie: the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild and the Deathsgate Guild.

***Membership Benefits.*** Those who are accepted into either adventurer's guild must pay dues of 12 gp each year. The primary benefit of belonging to a guild is access to work, since the guildmaster can connect parties of adventurers with patrons and jobs suited to their talents. Beyond that, there are a few additional benefits:

- You can store items at the guildhall free of charge.
- You can book lodging at the guildhall for 5 sp per night. The accommodations are modest, but the guild provides stronger security for lodgers and their possessions than you'd find at an inn.
- An adventurer's guild is an excellent source of information. By studying records and working with other guild members, you can gain advantage on any skill check to research a subject in which the guild has expertise or experience.

A strong rivalry exists between the Deathsgate Guild and the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. You might have trouble with members of the opposing guild, whether in the form of drunken boasting in a tavern or a rival stirring up trouble in the midst of a mission.

***The Clifftop Adventurer's Guild.*** Located in the Clifftop district of Upper Dura, this organization has a sterling reputation as a source of reliable explorers and champions. Clifftop adventurers are known for their courage and integrity, and guildmaster Summer Korranor holds members to a high standard of virtuous behavior. As a Clifftop adventurer, you're expected to keep your word, to stand by your comrades, to uphold the law, and never to intentionally endanger innocents with your actions. Many of the local businesses cater to adventurers, and if you're a member of the guild, you can expect a warm welcome in the taverns of Clifftop.

***The Deathsgate Guild.*** Adventurers who are willing to take on any job and to do whatever it takes to triumph might find themselves suited for membership in the Deathsgate Guild. Named for its proximity to the City of the Dead, the district of Deathsgate prides itself on being a haven for those who challenge death on a daily basis. The guild's founder, Kassh "Blackaxe" Droranath, doesn't care how his members do their jobs, as long as they don't fail.

#### The Circle of Song
A bard is a versatile individual, equally skilled at entertainment and espionage. These talents are perfectly matched to the city of Sharn, which is both the cultural heart of Breland and a nexus for intrigue and diplomacy. Bards have much to gain from the company of other bards, as they exchange news, stories, and songs. For this purpose, long ago a group of the finest bards in Sharn founded the Circle of Song, an alliance of entertainers and adventurers.

The Circle of Song is an informal organization, open to any bard who knows its customs and who can find an outpost. It has no membership dues; you're expected to make a donation if you make significant use of the group's resources. Membership provides the following benefits:

- You can always find food and lodging at a circle outpost, though you might be expected to entertain the patrons in exchange. If times are tough, your food and lodging might be a step lower than the usual quality of the inn, but at least it's free.
- You have advantage on ability checks made to perform research or gather information while in a circle outpost, provided you have an opportunity to peruse archives and talk with other members.
- Circle members are often willing to do minor favors for other members—gathering information, embarrassing a minor noble, causing a distraction. There's no cost for such a service, but anyone who helps you will expect you to provide similar assistance when they need it.

The first and oldest outpost of the Circle of Song is the Golden Horn in the University district of Upper Menthis; a few bards are almost always in residence and willing to share news and stories. Other, less elaborate outposts are maintained in Sharn, and over the centuries the circle has established outposts in most major cities and many smaller communities across Khorvaire. These sites are usually taverns or inns that have hidden areas accessible only to members of the circle.

Bards are expected to set aside personal rivalries while in a circle outpost, and any kind of combat or violence is prohibited. Violating this rule results in immediate expulsion from the circle, at the least.

#### Arcane Orders
Its mighty towers and floating spires mark Sharn as a symbol of mystic power and achievement. Soon after the founding of the city, the greatest wizards of Breland chose it to be the seat of their arcane order. Its goal was to celebrate excellence in the mystic arts, bringing together the greatest practitioners of magic in a society that rivals Arcanix and the institutions of Aundair.

A schism split the original society, but today both of the branches of the original organization, the Esoteric Order of Aureon and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows, are recognized and respected throughout Breland. Each one has lesser halls in every major city in the nation.

***Membership Benefits.*** Someone accepted into an arcane order must pay 1,000 gp to join, with ongoing dues of 250 gp each year thereafter. With this payment comes many benefits, including the following:

- You can stay at the order's hall in any major city and enjoy the amenities of a wealthy lifestyle free of charge.
- For as long as you have access to the order's hall, the cost of crafting a magic item at the site is reduced by 10 percent.
- While in the hall, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, as well as any ability checks involving arcane research.
- Membership in an arcane order grants prestige within Breland. Though this status provides no tangible benefit, it proves that you are a gifted mage and stand above any mere magewright or dabbler.

***The Esoteric Order of Aureon.*** Members of the larger of the two societies, the Esoteric Order of Aureon, take a vow to use their talents to preserve and advance civilization and to operate within the confines of the law. The Esoteric Order helped Galifar I maintain the rule of law, and many of its members served Breland during the Last War. Although its members aren't prohibited from studying any form of magic, the specialties of the order are abjuration, divination, and evocation magic. Wizards and artificers are almost always welcome in the guild. Sorcerers must prove their grasp of arcane theory to earn a place, and warlocks are rarely accepted as members. The hall of the Esoteric Order of Aureon is in the district of Clifftop in Upper Dura.

***The Guild of Starlight and Shadows.*** Breland's other arcane order encourages independence and innovation, qualities that contribute to a mutually uncomfortable relationship between the Guild of Starlight and Shadows and the Sharn Watch. The schools of conjuration, enchantment, and illusion are favored by this group. Warlocks, especially those of the Archfey, are generally welcome. Members of the Esoteric Order look down on Starlight wizards, and in turn the guild members often mock the wizards of the Esoteric Order and play pranks on them. The Guild of Starlight and Shadows has its hall in the Deathsgate district in Middle Tavick's Landing.

***The Closed Circle.*** There is one dark stain in the shared history of the arcane orders. Three hundred years ago, a third order arose in Sharn—a sinister cabal called the Closed Circle. This order specialized in transmutation and necromancy and dabbled in the forbidden lore of the daelkyr and the Dragon Below. It's said that the members of the Closed Circle went mad and sought to summon terrible things; whatever the truth, the guild was wiped out more than two hundred years ago by the combined action of the Church of the Silver Flame, the Esoteric Order, and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows. Hidden workshops of the Closed Circle might still be found in Sharn, where vengeful liches or other wizards of the Circle practice their dark arts in hiding.

## Wards of Sharn
Sharn is a vertical city, and elevation is an indicator of status and wealth. Each quarter is roughly divided into three levels, and the combination of quarter and level defines a ward. Thus, wards have names such as Lower Dura, Upper Central, and Middle Menthis.

Upper wards are the domain of the rich and powerful. Here you'll find the finest goods and the most expensive services. Only those who maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle can easily afford the prices for meals and lodging, and adventurers who maintain a squalid or wretched lifestyle might be treated with disdain (suffering disadvantage on Charisma checks).

Violence is rare in any of the upper wards, and the Sharn Watch actively patrols these areas. Although the guards here might be corrupt just as in a middle or lower ward, they're already being well paid by powerful nobles and criminal organizations, and they work efficiently in the service of these forces.

Middle wards are home to the middle classes. Here you'll find bustling markets and taverns, along with a wide range of entertainment and housing. Most goods and services are affordable by those of a modest or comfortable lifestyle, with a few higher-priced options tucked away. The Sharn Watch has a presence, but not as strong as in the upper wards.

Lower wards house the hard-working laborers, along with the destitute and the desperate, including refugees who lost everything in the war and orphans who never had anything to begin with. Services priced for a modest lifestyle can be found, but overall the lower wards are home to those who have no better than a poor lifestyle; a visitor who displays signs of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle might attract unwanted attention. The watch pays little attention to the lower districts, making them a haven for criminals and gangs.

These are stereotypes that don't apply to all wards. Dura is a particularly poor quarter, meaning that Upper Dura is effectively a middle ward in economic terms; similarly, because Central Plateau is a hub of wealth and power, Lower Central is effectively a middle ward.

Each ward is further subdivided into districts, which are neighborhoods defined by an economic role, a separate culture, or both. For example, Lower Northedge includes the districts of Stoneyard, Longstairs, and North Market. It's generally true that the combination of a district's ward and quarter will give you a broad idea of what to expect there. A district in Upper Central will typically be well kept and swarming with guards, while a district in Lower Dura will be squalid and dangerous.

### Getting Around
Sharn is an enormous city, and traveling on foot from one side of the city to the other can be time-consuming. Here are some travel-time guidelines:

- It takes at least 30 minutes to cross a ward.
- If you're traveling between wards, add 30 minutes for each ward you pass through.
- Dura and Tavick's Landing are especially large; double the time it takes to move through one of them.

For instance, traveling from Lower Menthis to Upper Central involves passing through three wards (taking a bridge from Lower Menthis to Lower Central, then ascending two levels) and can take 90 minutes or longer.

Not all the quarters are linked to one another by bridges. The connections that do exist include these:

- Central Plateau has bridges that lead to Northedge and Menthis.
- Dura is connected to Tavick's Landing and Menthis.
- Tavick's Landing is connected to Dura, Menthis, and Northedge.
- Menthis is connected to Tavick's Landing, Dura, and Central.
- Northedge is connected to Central and Tavick's Landing.

Traveling from district to district involves the use of bridges and ramps, along with magic lifts—vast floating disks that slowly ascend and descend along threads of mystical energy. Lifts are mainly used to move cargo and can be up to 30 feet in diameter. Most lifts have rails but aren't fully enclosed; if combatants fight on a lift, someone falling or being pushed off the edge is always a possibility.

For a speedier journey through the streets, House Orien manages a system of carriages for hire. Taking an Orien carriage cuts travel time in half and costs 2 cp per ward traveled. Flight is, of course, the fastest way to get around in Sharn, cutting travel time down to one-sixth of the walking pace (5 minutes per ward). It's also more expensive, at 2 sp per ward. The most common form of aerial transport is the skycoach, but many flying mounts, including **hippogriffs**, **griffons**, **pteranodons**, and **giant owls**, can be found for hire around the city.

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Who owns sharn? Portrait of The ir'Tains and the 60 Families
>>If you've read more than two issues of the *Sharn Inquisitive*, you've seen at least two stories about the ir'Tain family. King Boranel might rule Breland, and the Lord Mayor might be our highest appointed official, but the ir'Tains are the true royalty of our city. What citizen of Sharn doesn't have an opinion about the fate of Lord Dalian ir'Tain, lost at sea a decade ago? Many are sure that he's a prisoner of the sahuagin, which would explain why Lady Celyria has been funding expeditions into the sahuagin realms. Another camp maintains that Lord Dalian staged his death so he could embrace a swashbuckling life as a pirate king. If the truth ever comes out, you can be sure you'll read about it here!
>>
>>Matriarch Lady Celyria ir'Tain is the queen of high society in Sharn. Her activities and those of the ir'Tain children account for just as much newsprint as their father used to. Dalian's eldest son, Dalas ir'Tain, shocked society last week when he publicly denounced the Brelish monarchy. The dalliances of younger siblings Cyra and Daral sell more issues of the *Inquisitive* whenever such are reported, and the wedding of middle sister Cariana ir'Tain and Mayne Jhaelian of Aerenal will surely be the biggest social event of 998 YK.
>>
>>The ir'Tain fortune is tied to the City of Towers. Tain gold funded the construction of many of the towers of Sharn, and the family owns vast sections of the city. You've likely heard of the Sixty Families of Sharn, considered the guiding lights of the city. Most assume that these luminaries are ancient and established, their status tied to a royal decree. In fact, when the Tains built their mansion on Skyway, they ordered the architects to design a banquet hall that would seat sixty families and their servants. The original Sixty Families were those that received standing invitations to the first Tain Gala. Though the list has remained generally stable through the years, just last year Celyria expelled the ir'Moros family and gave their place to Saiden Boromar—a surprising advancement for a family that began as Cliffside hooligans.
>>
>>Anyone who strives to rise in Sharn society must earn the favor of the Sixty. Similarly, those who seek to explore and adventure in the wake of the Last War can surely find patrons among these elite. And from our desks, we will be watching to see which families will be next to rise and fall.
>>

## Central Plateau
The power and wealth of Sharn are concentrated in Central Plateau. Whether you're looking to deal with powerful merchants, city councilors, dragonmarked barons, or the ambassadors of other nations, Central Plateau is the place where big deals are made.

##### Central Plateau: Noteworthy Locations
| Location | Description | District |
|---|---|---|
| Aurora Gallery | The most prestigious auction house in Sharn, Aurora deals in magic items, exotic finds from Xen'drik, and other wonders. | Platinum Heights, Upper Central |
| City Archive | This enormous edifice holds the historical and legal records of Sharn and the surrounding regions. | Highest Towers, Upper Central |
| Council Hall | The seat of city government and the site of City Council meetings. The council meets weekly, and visitors can watch from the gallery. | Highest Towers, Upper Central |
| Gray Dragon Inn | This inn provides aristocratic and wealthy lodging for those who can afford it. | Platinum Towers, Upper Central |

| Pavilion of the Host | The center for worship of the Sovereign Host is a grand open tower surrounded by nine temples, each dedicated to one of the Sovereigns. | Sovereign Towers, Middle Central |

### Upper Central
Gold and power flow down from Upper Central. The district of Highest Towers is the seat of government, where city hall and the municipal archives are located. The Korranath is the name of both the central financial district and the grand temple of Kol Korran that dominates it. This district also houses the Kundarak Bank of Sharn and the Vaults, House Kundarak's ostensibly impenetrable storage facility.

Some of Sharn's wealthiest citizens live in the Mithral Tower district, and Platinum Heights is the most expensive market district in Sharn. It has fewer shops than the Bazaar of Dura, but if you're looking for top-quality goods or services, there's no finer—or more expensive—source to be found.

If you maintain no better than a poor lifestyle, many people in Upper Central will assume you're a servant or vagrant; this could cause you to have disadvantage on Charisma checks involving residents.

### Middle Central
This part of the city is a center for intrigue. The district of Ambassador Towers contains embassies and consulates from the Thronehold Nations, as well as Aerenal and Sarlona. Ambassador Towers is also home to the King's Citadel, the headquarters of Brelish intelligence. Across the ward, the district of Dragon Towers holds the primary enclaves of the dragonmarked houses.

The Sovereign Towers district has the grandest temples in Sharn. The Pavilion of the Host is a complex of nine towers devoted to the Sovereign Host, and the Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame is the seat of the religion. Although these temples are the locations of grand ceremonies and celebrations, many of the most devout priests serve in the city's smaller shrines.

### Lower Central
This district is peaceful and largely residential; it's the safest and most pleasant of the lower wards. Goods and services are largely priced for those with a comfortable lifestyle, and the Sharn Watch is plentiful and well paid. The district of Boldrei's Hearth has many reasonably priced inns (most run by House Ghallanda), and Olladra's Kitchen has a wide assortment of taverns and restaurants. Myshan Gardens is a residential district that caters to affluent artists, while Vallia Towers has a large community of half-elves.

### Things to Do in Central Plateau
Looking for work or amusement in this quarter? Some of the things you can do here include:

**Attend an auction**. The Aurora Gallery in Platinum Heights is the finest auction house in Sharn and specializes in auctions of exotic magic items and relics from Xen'drik. You never know what's going to be available—or who will be bidding against you.

**Plan a heist**. Perhaps your goals depend on recovering an item a villain has hidden in the vaults of Korranath. Can you penetrate the most secure facility in Sharn?

**Go to jail**. The King's Citadel in Ambassador Towers is also Sharn's high-security prison.

**Worship**. The primary temples of the Sovereign Host and the Silver Flame are located in Middle Central, along with a host of shrines to specific sovereigns and lesser faiths. Take part in a festival or drop in for some spiritual guidance!

**Engage in espionage**. Whether you work for your nation or get entangled in the schemes of the dragonmarked houses, Middle Central is home to a lot of powerful people who have a use for capable agents.

## Dura
Sharn began where Dura stands, but the city has left it behind in many ways. Many nowadays consider the oldest quarter of Sharn to be a blight on the City of Towers. The place is full of cracked and crumbling stonework, abandoned lift shafts, and everbright lanterns that have burned out and never been restored. Dura is riddled with poverty and crime; it's easily the most dangerous section of the city. But it also holds opportunities you can't find anywhere else. If you're looking for smuggled goods or a place to lie low, head to Dura.

##### Dura Quarter: Noteworthy Locations
| Location | Description | District |
|---|---|---|
| The Citadel of the Sun | A temple devoted to Dol Arrah, noteworthy for the three blessed griffons that reside there. | Hope's Peak, Upper Dura |
| The Clifftop Adventurer's Guild | An institution that provides adventurers with camaraderie and profitable work. | Clifftop, Upper Dura |
| The Drunken Dragon | A tavern frequented by members of the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. The food is modest, but it has the widest selection of exotic alcohol in Sharn. | Clifftop, Upper Dura |
| The Esoteric Order of Aureon | The guildhall of one of Sharn's most prestigious arcane orders. A reliable source for arcane spellcasting services. | Clifftop, Upper Dura |
| The Gold & White | This tavern offers fare of comfortable quality at modest prices. It caters to members of the Sharn Watch and Brelish veterans, but others will receive a cold welcome. | Daggerwatch, Upper Dura |
| Moraggan's | A posh tavern specializing in strong Mror spirits. Food and drink are wealthy in quality and cost. | Highhold, Upper Dura |
| The Mystic Market | A collection of shops specializing in different categories of magic items. Most merchandise is common or uncommon, but rare items are occasionally available. | Clifftop, Upper Dura |
| Pegasus Spire | The seat of House Vadalis in Sharn is one of the few enclaves where pegasi are raised and trained. Native to Syrania, these celestial beasts can become stranded in Sharn; Vadalis heirs care for them and match them with virtuous companions. | Highwater, Upper Dura |
| Ghallanda Hall | This proud Ghallanda enclave continues to operate amid the fading squalor of Middle Dura, and has become a tourist attraction. It offers a range of services, with food and lodging of poor to comfortable quality. | Underlook, Middle Dura |
| The Hollow Tower | A vertically oriented arena used for aerial jousting and other unusual sporting events. | Hareth's Folly, Middle Dura |
| The King of Fire | A comfortable tavern and gambling hall, known as one of the safest places to bet on the Race of Eight Winds and the events at the Hollow Tower. | Hareth's Folly, Middle Dura |
| The Anvil | This fading Ghallanda inn struggles to maintain its poor to modest quality. It's known to be under the protection of the Boromar Clan, which makes it one of the safest establishments in Lower Dura. | Callestan, Lower Dura |
| The Broken Mirror | A curious tavern owned by a family of changelings, the Broken Mirror changes its appearance and theme every week. It's rumored to be connected to the Tyrants. | Callestan, Lower Dura |
| The Silvermist Theater | A remnant of Callestan's glory days, this place is a shadow of the grand establishment it once was. The current owners are known for staging bizarre events at the Silvermist. Since the Sharn Watch stays out of Callestan, anything can happen here. | Callestan, Lower Dura |

### Upper Dura
This ward is full of activity. Its people are prospering, but there's an edge of desperation about them; many folk are on the lookout for opportunities to better themselves. Upper Dura has the general properties of a middle ward, with most goods and services priced for a modest or comfortable lifestyle. The merchants and artisans are accustomed to dealing with unusual individuals, and adventurers receive a warm welcome here.

Clifftop is a home away from home for explorers and mercenaries. Daggerwatch is a fortress district, containing garrisons for the Sharn Watch and the Brelish army. The Gold & White is a Daggerwatch tavern that caters to Brelish soldiers; those who hold a Brelish military rank will receive a warm welcome, while those who served other nations would be wise to take their business elsewhere.

In the dwarven district of Highhold, a center of activity is Morragin's, which serves the strongest spirits in Sharn, but it's no mere tavern; often patronized by Mror merchants and Kundarak agents, it maintains the highest of standards (with prices to match).

The Highwater district is home to the wealthiest inhabitants of Dura and is the site of Pegasus Spire, the enclave of House Vadalis. The temple district of Hope's Peak features the Citadel of Light, a grand temple of Dol Arrah and a bastion for the virtuous. The Overlook district is home to Sharn's kalashtar community and includes the only temple of the Path of Light in Breland.

### Middle Dura
Middle Dura caters to the working class. Its taverns are modestly priced, but there's gold among the dross.

The Bazaar of Dura is the largest commercial district in Sharn. In addition to the dozens of permanent shops and smithies, the streets of the bazaar are an ever-changing tapestry of stalls and tents. It's said that you can find anything here, if you're not too worried about where it came from and if you're prepared to contend with the cutpurses that prey on the crowds.

A small selection of merchants that regularly do business at the bazaar is given on the Bazaar Merchants table; roll a d10, or choose a location of interest.

##### Bazaar Merchants
| d10 | Merchant |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Secondhand Strings**. A must-stop shop for the bard on a budget, with a variety of gently used instruments. |
| 2 | **Korryn's Quill**. A reliable source for cartographers, calligraphers, and scribes of all stripes. |
| 3 | **Seven Leagues**. Owned by the cobbler Boots, this small stall has a remarkable selection of footwear. |
| 4 | **Borran's Blades**. Borran is one of the few halfling smiths in Sharn. He specializes in knives and daggers. |
| 5 | **Hearty Scales**. A stall serving grilled lizard meat and other Talentan delicacies. |
| 6 | **Roll and Conquer**. One of Sharn's only game stores. It does most of its business in cards and dice. |
| 7 | **The Old Apothecary**. Selling supplies for herbalists and alchemists, this claims to be Bazaar's oldest shop. |
| 8 | **Illumination**. This shop sells lamps, lanterns, candles, and torches. Some are magical. |
| 9 | **The Magewright's Miscellany**. This little shop deals in spell components. The clerks love to discuss magic. |
| 10 | **Sundry's Shop**. A gnome named Sundry runs a pawn shop filled with all manner of trinkets. |

Elsewhere in Middle Dura, the district of Hareth's Folly is a bizarre blend of architectural styles. One of the primary attractions is the Hollow Tower, an enormous arena that features aerial jousting and racing. The King of Fire is a grand tavern that hosts a broad range of gambling and bookmaking activities, legal and otherwise.

Many people make their homes in Middle Dura, even if their jobs take them elsewhere. Rattlestone and Tumbledown are mostly poor tenements. Stormhold contains crumbling manors still occupied by some of Sharn's oldest families, while many that have prospered have moved on to more prestigious districts.

### Lower Dura
The aptly named Precarious district in Lower Dura leans out over the edge of the cliffs, and the Skydocks—a system using gigantic arcane cranes and levitation—carry material up from Cliffside and the docks. Precarious is also filled with warehouses that hold these goods. Because Precarious plays an important role in the economy of the city, it's the only district in Lower Dura where the Sharn Watch maintains a significant presence.

The rest of Lower Dura, in stark contrast, has been left to rot. Ignored by the Watch, it is the domain of gangs and crime lords. The inhabitants of the ward are often protected from violence by their criminal connections or by virtue of having nothing worth stealing, but adventurers ought to tread lightly here, especially those who display the trappings of a wealthy lifestyle.

There was a time when Lower Dura was the heart of Sharn, and remnants of this glory remain. The Silvermist Theater in Callestan was built to entertain nobles. The ward boasted manors, temples, and a garrison for the watch. But all of these edifices were abandoned long ago, and now most are home to nothing but squatters and vermin.

The district of Callestan is a nexus of sorts, where all the major criminal powers of Sharn have a stake. Those groups are described in more detail later in this chapter.

The district of Fallen is a haunted ruin; this temple district was abandoned after it was struck by a falling tower. It's covered in more detail later in this chapter.

Malleon's Gate is home to the goblins of Sharn, along with other monstrous immigrants from Droaam and Darguun. The district can be an especially dangerous place for halflings or anyone tied to the Boromar Clan.

Oldkeep and Gate of Gold are wretched tenement districts. A significant halfling community lives in the district known as The Stores, which is also a stronghold for the Boromar Clan.

### Things to Do in Dura
Dura is a quarter of extremes, from the nearly idyllic atmosphere of Upper Dura, down to the danger of Lower Dura. Among its attractions and diversions are these:

**Gamble**. Legal gambling is heavily taxed in the city and limited in its scope. Dura is the place to find a wide range of shadier and more profitable games.

**Go shopping**. The Bazaar of Middle Dura is an excellent source for exotic goods, legal or otherwise. Clifftop, in Upper Dura, caters to adventurers and has a reasonable selection of magical goods.

**Bend the law**. Looking for a fence or need to hire an assassin? Lower Dura is the nexus for criminal activities in Sharn.

**Talk about the race.** The inhabitants of Dura are devoted to the Race of Eight Winds and are always willing to discuss the latest news.

**Suffer a terrible accident.** The Sharn Watch ignores much of Lower Dura. Stories circulate continuously about dragonmarked houses and mad wizards conducting dangerous experiments in Lower Dura without interference from the law.

## Menthis Plateau
The hub of Sharn's entertainment industry and home to Breland's largest university, Menthis Plateau is one of the most diverse quarters in Sharn. Whether you're looking for classical theater, a fine bookstore, or an illegal fighting ring, Menthis has something to offer.

##### Menthis Plateau: Noteworthy Locations
| District | Description | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Art Temple | This theater is renowned for its avant-garde techniques and subjects. | University, Upper Menthis |
| Davandi Fine Tailoring | In addition to being the city councilor representing Upper Menthis, the gnome Thurik Davandi is an accomplished tailor and magewright who produces the finest glamerweave clothing available in Sharn. | Den'iyas, Upper Menthis |
| Dezina Museum of Antiquities | Attached to Morgrave University, this building displays the relics recovered on the university's many expeditions. | University, Upper Menthis |
| Golden Horn | This wealthy inn includes a library, a few large meeting rooms, and a small concert hall. Performing at the Horn is an excellent opportunity for aspiring bards. | University, Upper Menthis |
| Grand Stage | This stage hosts grand performances of the beloved classics of Galifar, along with more modern works that follow classical traditions. | University, Upper Menthis |
| Great Hall of Aureon | Sharn's largest temple to the Sovereign Aureon, the Great Hall celebrates knowledge and learning. The clergy are sages and savants in a wide variety of fields. | University, Upper Menthis |
| Khavish Theater | Established by and for gnomes, the Khavish has ample seating for small creatures, and its shows make extensive use of illusions. | Den'iyas, Upper Menthis |
| Little Xen'drik | This area of small shops deals in antiquities and relics recovered from Xen'drik and the ruins below Sharn. Cloud Antiquities specializes in giant artifacts, while the Mekdall Gallery deals in ancient elven and drow goods. Windows on Yesterday looks for items with historical significance, and Echoes of the Past deals in magic items with practical uses. | Seventh Tower, Upper Menthis |
| Sharn Opera House | Performances at the Sharn Opera are one of the most highbrow forms of entertainment in the city. | University, Upper Menthis |
| Stargazer Theater | This open-air theater focuses on popular entertainment with family appeal. | University, Upper Menthis |
| Classic Theater | A small and inexpensive theater, the Classic performs only works written before the start of the Last War. | Smoky Towers, Middle Menthis |
| The Burning Ring | The Ring offers blood sport and gladiatorial combat. These dangerous matches aren't sanctioned by law, and the Burning Ring constantly changes locations to avoid the Sharn Watch. It's always last seen somewhere in Lower Menthis. | Lower Menthis |
| Diamond Theater | A cheap theater once known for bawdy humor, the Diamond has gained fame due to its playwright in residence and has produced several plays about the impact of the Last War. | Downstairs, Lower Menthis |
| Ten Torches | The cheapest ticket in Sharn's theater scene, Ten Torches alternates between lowbrow comedy and bizarre shows that no respectable theater would stage. | Torchfire, Lower Menthis |

### Upper Menthis
Elegant and civilized, Upper Menthis is home to four of the finest theaters in Breland: the cutting-edge Art Temple, the colorful Khavish Theater, the traditional Grand Stage, and the open-air Stargazer Theater, as well as the Kavarrah Concert Hall.

The shops in Upper Menthis deal mainly in fine food, fashion, and exotic goods. For instance, in the Seventh Tower district, Window on Yesterday, Echoes of the Past, the Mekdall Gallery, and Cloud Antiquities all buy and sell interesting antiques and trinkets from distant lands.

The district of Den'iyas is a gnome neighborhood that provides a glimpse into the culture of Zilargo. Davandi Fine Tailoring is the source of some of the finest glamerweave clothing in Khorvaire, and the district also hosts a number of businesses that specialize in alchemy, illusion, or divination. Visitors should be aware that intrigue is the primary pastime in Den'iyas, and that hapless adventures can easily find themselves pulled into intricate schemes or feuds.

Upper Menthis also contains the University district, home to Breland's finest institutions of learning. More information about this district can be found in *chapter 1*.

### Middle Menthis
Middle Menthis boasts the most diverse population of any ward in Sharn. The Little Plains district is the destination for halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Cassan Bridge has a significant population of orcs and half-orcs from the Shadow Marches. Immigrants from the Lhazaar Principalities have settled in the Warden Towers district, which is primarily a garrison for the Sharn Watch. The district of Smoky Towers had a significant Cyran community even before the Last War; now, this area has become a haven for Cyrans wealthy enough to escape the refugee camps of High Walls.

One of the most prominent attractions In Smoky Towers is the Classic Theater. The place lives up to its name by staging only traditional works written before the start of the Last War. Although the Grand Stage in the University district also performs more recent works echoing the classical style, the Classic has a stated policy of not even considering new works.

The Everbright district might be of particular interest to adventurers. A wide assortment of magewrights ply their trade here, and the shops have a good selection of magic items (of common and uncommon rarity). The people of Middle Menthis are law-abiding folk; visitors looking for spellcasters to help with illegal activities or who want to sell stolen artifacts will likely have better luck in Lower Dura.

### Lower Menthis
Providing cheap entertainment for the masses, Lower Menthis is crowded. The Firelight district is filled with sketchy taverns and theaters ranging from the innocent to the risque, as well as gambling halls, brothels, and spontaneous performances in the streets.

Lower Menthis is also home to the Burning Ring, a fight club where spectators bet on amateur gladiators. Technically illegal, the Burning Ring moves around the ward. Competitors are armed but unarmored; matches continue until a contestant yields, but fatalities do happen.

### What's on the Bill?
People come from across Breland to experience the Menthis art scene. All manner of entertainment can be found in this quarter, from bawdy Lower Menthis events to the traditional works of the Classic Theater in Middle Menthis. The Shows in Menthis table provides a sampling of the many performances staged in Menthis.

##### Shows in Menthis
| d8 | Event |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Tira's Tears**. A speculative drama about the founder of the Church of the Silver Flame. (Grand Stage, Upper Menthis) |
| 2 | **Facade**. A comedy of errors about a family of changelings, involving a tangled web of mistaken identities. (Art Temple, Upper Menthis) |
| 3 | **Five Lives**. A bitter reflection on the tragedy of the Last War, as seen through the eyes of five soldiers. Written by up-and-coming playwright Luca Syara. (Diamond Theater, Lower Menthis) |
| 4 | **Galifar Triumphant**. A beloved history based on the legendary king and the conflict that established the Kingdom of Galifar. (Classic Theater, Middle Menthis) |
| 5 | **The Late Count**. A comic opera by the bard Kessler, revolving around a Karrnathi count who is resurrected as a zombie. (Sharn Opera House, Upper Menthis) |
| 6 | **The Carnival of Shadows.** House Phiarlan's traveling circus, a mesmerizing blend of illusions, physical arts, and exotic beasts. The traveling troupe always visits Smoky Towers (Middle Menthis). |
| 7 | **The Brelish Symphony Orchestra.** A performance of some of the finest works of Seventh Century Brelish composers. (Kavarrah Concert Hall, Upper Menthis) |
| 8 | **Reflection**. A one-person show performed by the changeling Adi, exploring the multitudes that exist within us all. (Ten Torches, Lower Menthis) |

### Things to Do in Menthis Plateau
Any list of attractions that tries to summarize what Menthis Plateau has to offer, even without considering all the performance events, is doomed to be incomplete. Of the countless possibilities, some of the most popular reasons to come here are the following:

**Consult a sage**. Morgrave University might not be the finest institute of learning in Khorvaire, but it's the best Sharn has to offer. Whether you want to conduct your own research in the library or find a specialist in goblin history, Morgrave likely has what you need.

**Go into show business.** Menthis has a wide range of performance venues, from the Grand Stage to the many taverns of Lower Menthis. In addition to enjoying the entertainment, you could try to find work—either showcasing your artistic talents on stage or displaying another sort of prowess in the Burning Ring.

**Join an expedition**. Scholars at Morgrave often sponsor expeditions to Xen'drik and into the ruins below Sharn. Cyran nobles in Smoky Towers sometimes hire brave souls to venture into the Mournland to reclaim lost treasures.

**See other cultures**. Den'iyas brings a touch of Zilargo to Sharn. You might find a clawfoot raptor running down the streets in Little Plains, or a Gatekeeper druid casting bones on Cassan Bridge.

## Northedge
The Northedge residential area is the quietest quarter of Sharn. At first glance there's little to attract adventurous sorts, unless someone is interested in purchasing top-quality real estate. At the same time, you never know when this charming and innocuous area could be the site of a nefarious cult or a devilish plot.

##### Northedge Quarter: Noteworthy Locations
| Location | Description | District |
|---|---|---|
| Gates of Passage | Built from Aereni densewood, this spire serves both as the embassy of Aerenal and a temple of the Undying Court. Aereni citizens who die in Sharn are interred in the temple crypts until their remains can be transported to Aerenal. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| Nightshade | An apothecary dealing in exotic herbs and salves, Nightshade is also a tavern specializing in lightly poisoned beverages. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| The Oaks | A legendary restaurant that serves Aereni and Brelish cuisine. The quality is unmatched, as are the aristocratic prices. Head chef Maza Thadian has maintained the Oaks for over three hundred years, but after her recent appointment as city councilor for Upper Northedge she is often occupied with other matters. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| The Silver Bough | This establishment deals in arms crafted in the Aereni tradition. This merchandise includes magic items, but woodshaper Tanar Mendyrian takes time to produce his wonders, and only a limited selection is available at any given time. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| The Winding Root | A marketplace and gallery that showcases the work of elven artisans, including sculptures, textiles, and fine clothing. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| The Veil of Flesh | This studio deals in Aereni body art and alteration, such as tattoos and cosmetic transmutation. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| Coldflame Keep | A garrison temple of the Silver Flame, this place once housed a hundred templars dedicated to protecting Sharn from supernatural threats. It has largely been abandoned; only a dozen devoted templars and adepts remain in residence. | High Hope, Middle Northedge |
| Daca's Watch | A dwarf named Daca has been sitting on a pillar in Northedge for over a century, offering advice and encouragement. Though she doesn't claim to be a priest, many believe that Daca is blessed and guided by Boldrei. | High Hope, Middle Northedge |
| The Bear's Rest | A modest inn maintained by a beasthide shifter named Leara, who usually gives a discount to traveling shifters. The decor features various exotic hides. | North Market, Lower Northedge |
| Fathen's Shrine | This marker in North Market commemorates a miracle that exposed a network of wererats in Sharn, along with the priest of the Silver Flame who died while fighting them. Pilgrims devoted to the Silver Flame often visit the shrine. | North Market, Lower Northedge |
| The Horse and Hearth | Though not as colorful as the Bear's Rest, this large inn is maintained by House Ghallanda and offers rooms of modest and comfortable quality. | North Market, Lower Northedge |
| The Rat's Nest | A modest tavern catering to the shifters of Lower Northedge, the Rat's Nest is a haven for gossip and serves food and drink in the Eldeen style. | North Market, Lower Northedge |

### Upper Northedge

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Enigma of the Diamond voice
>>I challenge anyone to leave a performance of *The Broken Sword* with dry eyes. I believe that even a warforged would be moved to tears by this unflinching look at the spiritual cost of war. It's brutal, painful, and true—which is why it was all the more shocking when it first opened at the Diamond Theater. The Downstairs district of Lower Menthis is mainly known for its bawdy entertainment and base comedy, not cutting-edge political commentary. Thus, we critics assumed that this dramatic work was a singular event, until a new play titled *Fallen Angels* exceeded our every expectation. Month after month in recent times, the Diamond has struck us to the quick with emotional works about the Last War and the psychic wounds we're still struggling with.
>>
>>Who is the playwright of the Diamond Theater responsible for these stirring stories? Her name is Luca Syara, but beyond that, she's an enigma. There's no such person on the rolls of the bardic colleges of Breland, and House Phiarlan and House Thuranni claim to know nothing about her. Syara shuns the spotlight and refuses all interviews. While her works are being debated and celebrated in classrooms and taverns, the artist spends her days in the dingy back rooms of the Diamond Theater. This seclusion has led to a number of fanciful rumors. Some say Syara fought in the Last War and that she was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning. A wilder rumor maintains that she is an exile from the Faerie Court of Thelanis, an archfey bound to human form.
>>
>>While we wait for answers to this mystery, we encourage you to sample Syara's latest work. *Five Lives* is a gutwrenching tragedy that forces us to look at our darkest hours, and to consider the suffering of our enemies and the common threads that unite us all. If you're looking to forget your troubles, by all means, go see *Facade* or *The Late Count*. But if you want to take in a performance that might make you a better person, do whatever it takes to get tickets to *Five Lives*.
>>

Upper Northedge is the perfect place for the noble who can afford a manor in the clouds but wants to avoid the bustle of Upper Central. The districts of Crystal Bridge and Oak Towers are filled with spire-topped manors and grand estates. A host of rooftop parks and gardens provide lovely spaces to sit and reflect.

Shae Lias is arguably the most remarkable district of Upper Northedge. Its population is largely composed of elves, and it is a bastion of Aereni culture and traditions. The heart of Shae Lias is the Gates of Passage, a grand structure that is both the Aereni embassy and a temple to the Undying Court. The priests of the Undying Court don't share this information with outsiders, but many residents believe that an actual member of the Court—an ancient undead elf possessing vast knowledge and divine power—resides in the temple.

Other points of interest in Shae Lias include the Oaks, one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, which serves food of the highest quality (and priced accordingly). The Veil of Flesh specializes in Aereni body art, in the form of both traditional tattoos and temporary illusions woven directly into the skin. The business known as Nightshade might be the most unusual watering hole in Sharn, doubling as apothecary and tavern; the house specialty is beverages tainted with weak poisons, designed to take the imbiber to the very edge of death.

### Middle Northedge
This ward caters to the middle class of Sharn, offering a wide range of comfortable housing. Dwarves make up most of the population, with the highest concentration in the district of Holdfast. In contrast to the residents of Highhold in Upper Dura, the dwarves of Holdfast have deep roots in Sharn and feel no strong connection to the Mror Holds or its traditions.

High Hope is a temple district; although the city's most impressive churches and shrines are located in Upper Central, it's commonly known that if you're looking for a truly devoted priest, you should go to High Hope. The most notable feature of the district is Daca's Watch. Twelve feet high, this pillar is thought to have once held a statue or monument. Over a century ago, a gnome named Daca climbed atop the pedastal. She has remained there ever since, and shouts advice to anyone who passes by. Although Daca doesn't claim to be a priest, the people of the community say that she's blessed by the god Boldrei and speaks with the Sovereign's voice. True or not, Daca's advice has proven to be remarkably sound, and she and her pillar have become a tourist attraction.

### Lower Northedge
Although it's poverty-stricken, Lower Northedge is a significant step up from the slums of Lower Dura. The people of Lower Northedge don't look for trouble, and they don't like it coming to their doorstep. North Market is one of the largest markets in Sharn, though in contrast to the Bazaar of Dura it mostly offers simple, everyday goods.

Lower Northedge has a significant shifter population. The Rat's Nest is a tavern that caters to shifters, and the Bear's Rest is an inn run by a family of shifters. Tooth & Nail is an apothecary specializing in the care of fangs and claws. Particularly in the districts of North Market and Stoneyard, shifter children play hrazhak in the streets; this flamboyant sport involves making dramatic leaps and scaling walls.

The Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is an infamous spot in North Market. It is dedicated to a crusading priest of the Silver Flame who uncovered a group of wererats in the early days of Sharn. Fathen was torn apart by the wererats he had exposed, and in his honor the Church of the Silver Flame raised the shrine on this site. It's said that any lycanthrope that enters the shrine will be forced into its true form. Pilgrims devoted to the Silver Flame come from across Khorvaire to pray at the shrine, but the local shifter population has no love for the pilgrims or the church.

### Things to Do in Northedge
Northedge is the most peaceful quarter in Sharn. It does have a few taverns and temples, but if you're looking for excitement or a wide selection of goods and services, you'll want to go elsewhere. Even so, Northedge boasts some notable special attractions:

**Settle down**. If you're looking for a place to live in Sharn, Lower Northedge residences are of reasonable quality and price and offer more security than Lower Dura.

**Die in style**. The elves of Shae Lias are experts in funerary customs and embalming. In addition, the high priest of the Gates of Passage is capable of raising the dead.

**Find a patron**. Many eccentric nobles make their homes in Upper Northedge. A patron of the arts could take an interest in the career of a bard or an entertainer. A collector might keep capable adventurers on retainer with the understanding that they'll deliver any Dhakaani artifacts they come across in their travels. You never know what benefits a patron will provide; at the very least, having a patron can provide you with an introduction to high society.

## Tavick's Landing
Everyone who comes to Sharn, whether by land or air, passes through Tavick's Landing. The quarter took on a martial aspect during the Last War, and the tense atmosphere can still be felt today. On the positive side, Watch Commander Iyanna ir'Talan has gone to great efforts to purge corruption in the local garrisons of the Sharn Watch; as a result, this is one of the few districts where the Watch is both helpful and competent. On the downside, visitors from any nation that fought against Breland during the war might be greeted with suspicion or hostility.

##### Tavick's Landing: Noteworthy Locations

| The Deathsgate Guild | A society where adventurers can hone their skills and seek profitable work. The Deathsgate Guild has a sinister reputation, earned because its members will do anything in pursuit of success. | Deathsgate, Middle Tavick's Landing |

| Slogar's | This modest restaurant serves traditional Karrnathi cuisine. The ambience is a bit gloomy, but the prices are reasonable, and the food is very filling. | Graywall, Middle Tavick's Landing |
| Tooth and Nail | A comfortable tavern devoted to the sport of hrazhak. Most of the clientele are shifters, but anyone willing to talk hrazhak will find friends here. | Cornerstone, Middle Tavick's Landing |

| Terminus Station | An enclave of House Orien, this site contains the lightning rail station. The administrators coordinate the many Orien caravans that come and go from Sharn. Many of the other dragonmarked houses have small outposts in or around Terminus Station, allowing travelers to immediately access the services of House Sivis, House Deneith, and others. | Terminus, Lower Tavick's Landing |
| Velvet's | Staffed by changelings, this comfortable inn specializes in fulfilling fantasies; both the staff and the rooms can be adapted to fit any scenario. Though some clients have romance in mind, others come to Velvet's to relive triumphs, to prepare for debates or trials, or for help in developing a new identity. | Dragoneyes, Lower Tavick's Landing |

### Upper Tavick's Landing
This ward is effectively a self-contained city catering to the nobles that live there. It has fine housing, skilled services, a luxurious mercantile district, and even an entire district—Sunrise—designed for the servants of the nobles. The services and lodging in Sunrise accommodate those with poor or modest lifestyles, as opposed to the higher-priced goods found elsewhere in the ward.

For those willing to put up with its restrictive laws, Upper Tavick's Landing has many fine features. Wyredd's Spirits is the best source for wine in Sharn. The shop Crystals of Denion buys and sells rare magic items, though it only has a handful of such items at any given time. Transmutation is a renowned beauty salon providing both mundane and arcane services. House Deneith maintains a fortified garrison and training facility in the Copper Arch district.

#### The Laws of Upper Tavick's Landing
During the war, fears of attacks by foreign agents resulted in the establishment of a number of laws here that affect visitors, including adventurers, to this day.

The soldiers of House Deneith have full authority to act as agents of the Sharn Watch in Upper Tavick's Landing, and staff of Deneith's elite Blademark mercenaries maintain checkpoints at the district's edges.

You need a license to carry a weapon in Upper Tavick's Landing. It costs only 5 gp, but you have to plead your case to a clerk. Any Blademark or member of the watch can demand to see your license and might confiscate unauthorized weapons. You also need a license to cast spells in the ward. It costs 10 gp, and you must specify the spells you intend to cast. A fine can be levied for any unauthorized use of magic. To get licenses for weapons or spellcasting, you'll have to go to the courthouse in the Twelve Pillars district.

Another law requires inhabitants to dress "in a manner that upholds the solemn dignity of this proud ward." Blademarks and officers of the watch can choose how they interpret this. Typically, armor is considered inappropriate unless you're tied to House Deneith or the Sharn Watch, or you've served with the Brelish military. Anyone in contempt of this law is escorted out.

Any sort of unruly behavior—fighting, shouting in the streets, and the like—brings a fine of up to 5 gp and temporary expulsion from the ward.

### Middle Tavick's Landing
Unlike the upper ward, Middle Tavick's Landing welcomes travelers and tourists. The ward features a host of lively taverns and excellent inns. The Cornerstone is a huge arena that hosts events ranging from circuses to aerial jousting. The Deathsgate district caters to adventurers, much as the Clifftop district of Upper Dura does. Like Clifftop, the district has an adventurer's guild—though the Deathsgate Guild has a dark reputation, and its members often pick fights with Clifftop adventurers. (See the "*Adventurer's Guilds*" section for more information.) House Jorasco has a large house of healing in the ward, and House Deneith maintains a recruiting station for would-be mercenaries.

The Graystone district has deep roots in Karrnathi culture that predate the Last War; Slogar's and the Bloody Mug are places where homesick Karrns can enjoy blood sausage and Nightwood ale. The district is a haven for Karrnathi soldiers who want to avoid Brelish aggression and a place where followers of the Blood of Vol can practice their faith.

Tavick's Market is one of Sharn's major market districts; located directly above the Terminus lightning rail station, it's filled with stands selling produce and goods brought in by local farmers.

![[101-3-06.png|right|300]](House Jorasco's House of Healing in Middle Tavick's Landing)

### Lower Tavick's Landing
Two land routes to Sharn both end at Lower Tavick's Landing. The Orien lightning rail deposits passengers in the district of Terminus, while those who travel to Sharn on the Old Road arrive at Wroann's Gate. Getting to the better parts of Sharn from here means passing through Black Arch, a heavily fortified garrison district designed to repel enemies and withstand a full siege. The ward offers a variety of services catering to travelers; the Dragoneyes district is a maze of taverns, inns, brothels, and gambling halls. Dragoneyes is also noteworthy for being the site of one of the few changeling communities in Breland.

House Orien has a strong presence in Lower Tavick's Landing, and Orien heirs, laborers, and teamsters can be found in many of the districts. House Lyrandar and House Deneith are also well represented, with their representatives arranging matters of trade, transport, and security.

These days, Lower Tavick's Landing is best known for High Walls, a former residential district converted into a home for refugees from the Last War. High Walls is filled past capacity, mostly by Cyrans who were displaced by the Mourning. The gates are open at present, but High Walls is designed to serve as a fortress prison if the need arises, and the Sharn Watch keeps an eye out for any signs of unrest.

### Things to Do in Tavick's Landing

>> ##### Voice of Breland—is your Neighbor a cyran invader?
>>In the wake of the Mourning, our king welcomed the survivors of that tragedy into our cities. In Sharn, High Walls alone holds more Cyran refugees than Karrnath has allowed across its borders. If you read the Sharn Inquisitive or the Korranberg Chronicle, you've heard the endless litany of how difficult life is, tales of overcrowding, starvation, and disease. Although we at the Voice of Breland sympathize with all who suffer, we refuse to ignore the deadly threat in our midst. The majority of Cyrans who survived the Mourning did so because they were beyond the borders of their nation. And why is that? Because they were soldiers.
>>
>>The Sharn Inquisitive talks about starving children and ailing peasants, but it doesn't mention the Cyran special forces and elite war mages who now reside in High Walls. As Brelish, we all want to show compassion to the truly innocent, but let us never forget that these people were once our enemy and could be again. And let us also remember that the cause of the Mourning remains a mystery. Was it divine punishment for Cyran sins that have yet to be washed clean? Or could it have been a premature activation of an arcane weapon—and if so, could Cyran artificers already be working on an improved version in the heart of our greatest city?
>>
>>Remain alert, people of Breland! Don't let the current plight of these unfortunates blind you to the danger!
>>

As a metropolitan district filled with immigrants, merchants, and travelers from across Khorvaire and beyond it, Tavick's Landing offers a host of opportunities to enjoy food and entertainment from distant lands. Or you might find yourself here for one of a few specific reasons, such as:

**Take a chance**. The Dragoneyes district is filled with ways to lose your wages, both in established gambling halls and on street corners. If you you're looking for something a little more exotic, see if you can find Chance. This is the name both of a secret, roaming gambling den and of the changeling who runs it. In addition to offering all manner of mundane games and bets, Chance is said to be able to arrange and cover nearly any sort of wager or duel. Are you ready to gamble with a fiend? Would you wager a year of your life for a moment of good fortune when you need it the most? If any of the rumors are true, these are examples of what's possible at Chance.

**Find refuge**. Though most of the refugees in High Walls come from Cyre, the district is a haven for anyone displaced in the war, including Brelish. The place is overcrowded, however, and resources are stretched thin. Tensions are high, and feuds and power struggles among the refugees take place regularly. If you're from Cyre, you might be able to find a cot in High Walls, especially if you already have friends or family living there.

**Bond over blood**. The Graystone district in Middle Tavick's Landing is one of the few places in Breland where the Blood of Vol religion is practiced openly. Residents are circumspect about their activities, and undead servants are largely kept off the streets. But if you're a follower of the faith, it's a place where you can participate in the Sacrament of the Blood or consult with a priest. It's also the best place to find a skilled necromancer, or to hear rumors about the latest schemes of the Order of the Emerald Claw.

## Above and Below
The five main quarters of Sharn make up the bulk of the city. But a few additional districts lie above and below the metropolis proper, including wondrous sites and dangerous places that most folk prefer to avoid.

##### Above and Below Sharn: Noteworthy Locations
| Location | Deascription | District |
|---|---|---|
| The Azure Gateway | This luxurious hotel and restaurant recently replaced an old Ghallanda inn. The menu is a "Galifar fusion," combining styles from across the Five Nations. | Skyway |
| The Celestial Vista | This legendary restaurant is owned by Skyway's city councilor, Lady Evix ir'Marasha. The floor is studded with crystal windows, allowing diners to look down into the city below. The food isn't incredible, but tourist crowds keep the Vista filled with customers. | Skyway |
| The Cloud Dragon | This restaurant serves traditional Brelish cuisine, and it does so exceptionally well. It's rarely as crowded as the other venues in Skyway, but locals know its value. | Skyway |
| The Dragon's Hoard | This resort, maintained by House Ghallanda, offers every luxury for those who can afford its high prices. | Skyway |
| Tain Manor | Sharn's social life revolves around the ir'Tain family. The monthly Tain Gala is the hottest ticket in town, and it's held at the family estate in Skyway. | Skyway |
| Mud Caves | This shantytown sits on the edge of Cliffside, where generations of destitute people have carved out homes in the cliff walls. It's a wretched existence, but most of the inhabitants have no other options. It also makes an excellent hiding place for fugitives. | Cliffside |
| Sharn's Welcome | Also known as the docks of Cliffside, this area is rough and dirty. Its taverns frequently host brawls, while the inns offer travelers a wide variety of ways to be cheated or robbed. | Cliffside |
| Ship's Towers | Drifting alongside the Cliffside docks is a collection of rafts, ships, and houseboats lashed together to form a floating community. | Cliffside |
| Keldoran Forge | Though most of the foundries in the Cogs are devoted to large-scale industry, the dwarf Antos Keldoran maintains a small forge and produces bespoke arms and armor. | Ashblack |
| The Pool of Onatar's Tears | A small temple in the Blackbones district holds a pool said to be blessed by the god Onatar. Smiths come from across Khorvaire to dip their tools in the pool. | Blackbones |
| The Red Hammer | The Red Hammer is Sharn's only inn maintained by and for warforged. It offers those who work in the Cogs opportunities to socialize, along with repair and cosmetic services. | Blackbones |

### Skyway
![[102-3-07.png|right|300]]

A number of floating towers drift above the upper wards of Sharn, but these are dwarfed by Skyway, an entire district suspended above and between Central Plateau and Menthis Plateau. Built on an island of solidified cloud, Skyway holds the mansions of the wealthiest people in Khorvaire—nobles whose feet never touch the ground. It's a realm of wonders, filled with the finest examples of luxury and extravagance that gold can buy and magic can produce. For instance, Cloudpool Park is formed from sculpted cloudstuff, with window panels of ice that provide a view of the city below.

Skyway is home to lavish estates. Prior to the Last War, noble families from across the Five Nations maintained mansions here. Though some of these places remain in the hands of their original owners, others were seized by the crown during the Last War and sold to wealthy citizens of Breland. The resulting influx of residents has brought more diversity to the district, with dragonmarked heirs and even wealthy criminals living alongside the nobility. The grandest estate in Skyway is Tain Manor, home of the ir'Tain family and the monthly Tain Gala (see "*Holidays*" earlier in this chapter).

This district offers the highest-priced services in the city. The Dragon's Hoard is a Ghallanda resort, where travelers can enjoy the utmost in luxury if they can afford the most expensive amenities. The Celestial Vista and the Cloud Dragon are wondrous restaurants. The Azure Gateway is a new hotel and restaurant that has replaced a Ghallanda establishment. The owner has remained anonymous, and this touch of mystery has piqued interest in the place.

If you're interested in mingling with nobles or celebrities, or if you want to pull off a heist that targets the richest people in Sharn, Skyway is the place to do that.

No bridges or lifts connect Skyway to the rest of the city, so the usual way to reach the floating district is by taking a skycoach or hiring a flying mount.

### Cliffside
Cliffside encompasses the docks and waterfront of Sharn, running along the edge of the Dagger River and up the cliff above it. Massive lifts levitate goods up to the skydocks in the district of Precarious. The area's rough and poor, filled with sailors and dockworkers. Many of these boisterous folk love the life in Cliffside; as a common saying goes, "Better a tankard of ale in Cliffside than a barrel of Central wine."

Plenty of legitimate services can be found here—ships need supplies and repairs, goods need to be stored, captains need to hire crew, and sailors need a dry bed to sleep in once in a while—but other businesses meet different kinds of demands. These services include bordellos, taverns, gaming dens, and shadier entertainments for sailors to spend their off duty hours and wages on.

Even though the Sharn Watch has a token presence here, Cliffside remains one of the most crime-ridden districts in the city. This situation is exacerbated by the presence of sahuagin, who sell their services as guides to help ships traveling to Xen'drik. In fact, the sahuagin rarely initiate violence, but there have been clashes between them and aggressive, drunken sailors.

### The Cogs
The Cogs lie deep beneath Sharn, below the sewers and Old Sharn (described later in this chapter). Streams of Fernian lava flow through this area, and over the centuries, House Cannith has helped Breland establish vast foundries that tap this mystic resource. Ashblack and Blackbones are industrial districts, largely inhabited by warforged laborers and miserable workers of other races. It is said that House Cannith maintains a forgehold in the Ashblack district, and that this is where Baron Merrix d'Cannith conducts his experiments.

The Sharn Watch maintains a presence in the Cogs, and overseers from House Cannith are stationed here to keep things in order. Beyond these industrial districts lies the deeper tunnels of Khyber's Gate, a tenement district.

Blackbones has a number of remarkable locations. For example, the Pool of Onatar's Tears is sacred to the Sovereign of the Forge. The current caretaker is a warforged priest named Smith, who believes that Onatar has plans for the warforged, and that the warforged and creatures of flesh are meant to live together.

Most of the citizens of Sharn have never been to the Cogs. The area does house the bulk of the city's warforged population, and if you're looking for a particular warforged, it's the best place to start. Industrial espionage and labor struggles can add drama to adventures in the great foundries, not to mention the possibility of artificers with secret forges hidden in the Cogs.

## Dungeons of Sharn
Sharn boasts countless opportunities for adventurers. You can get caught up in espionage in Upper Central or drawn into a crime war in Lower Dura. Aside from the intrigues and politics of the city, Sharn has a wide range of cursed ruins, haunted slums, shunned catacombs, and other dangerous places. Wise folk avoid these areas, but those whose hunger for adventure outweighs their good sense might do the opposite.

### The City of the Dead
Look to the cliffs to the north of Sharn, and you'll see a collection of crypts embedded into the cliff face. This is the City of the Dead, the final resting place of the wealthiest citizens of Sharn. Common folk are cremated after death, but members of the Sixty Families and others with sufficient wealth have their remains interred in the tombs and tunnels of this necropolis.

Few people reside in this area. Among its major features are Aureon's Holt, a temple of the Restful Watch, where Sovereign priests conduct funerals and serve as the caretakers of the tombs. Warden Tower is an outpost of the Church of the Silver Flame, staffed by a single hermit tasked to watch for supernatural threats.

Though the City of the Dead is largely peaceful, stories circulate about dark powers lurking there. Some parents warn their children of the Lich-Priest Gath, who steals disobedient children and forces them to work in his kingdom of the dead, polishing the bones of his skeletal subjects.

### Old Sharn
Sharn was built on the foundations of an older city, which was itself built atop goblin ruins. This old city was destroyed by dark magic, courtesy of the elemental powers of the infamous Halas Tarkanan and his consort, the Lady of the Plague. It is said that vile powers still linger in these ruins, and for this reason King Galifar I had all the passages to this undercity sealed with gates of metal and magic. These portals remain sealed today, and it's illegal to tamper with them. But it's generally assumed that many treasures are hidden in the ruins of Old Sharn, along with untold secrets of the past.

No one knows exactly what lurks in Old Sharn. The ruins could contain ghosts or other undead, the vengeful spirits of the aberrant-marked people who took refuge in the fallen city. In olden times, the Lady of the Plague had power over vermin and disease, and a fanciful tale says that even today the undercity is inhabited by swarms of sentient rats and beetles.

### Fallen

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Dawn of disease
>>You'll hear warning bells toll tomorrow morning. You'll see packs of people with their faces hidden by plague masks or strips of cloth. Jorasco healers will roam the streets offering free examinations and blessings. If you're new to Sharn, have no fear! This isn't the outbreak of disease it appears to be; it's how Sharn observes the Lady's Day, commemorating a tragic incident in our past.
>>
>>Today, aberrant dragonmarks are rare. But there was a time long ago when they were far more common. An army of aberrant heirs made their home here in the early days of Sharn, led by Halas Tarkanan—known as the Earthshaker—and the Lady of the Plague, who had power over vermin and disease. When the dragonmarked houses laid siege to the city and their defeat became inevitable, the two unleashed their full might. Tarkanan's power reduced the early towers to rubble, and the Lady of the Plague called forth a horde of disease-infested vermin.
>>
>>For centuries afterward, the region was shunned. When our modern city was built, the cursed ruins were sealed away. But one never knows when the darkness could rise up again. On the Lady's Day, we remember the tragedy that once befell Sharn, and we prepare for the possibility that it could happen again.
>>

The Fallen district in Lower Dura was once known as Godsgate. When the first towers were raised, Godsgate was the temple district. It had shrines and statues dedicated to the Sovereigns, a proud church of the Silver Flame, even a monument to the Undying Court. But as Sharn grew and prospered, religious services were moved to grander temples in the upper wards. Godsgate became a tenement district, and the shrines and monuments were forgotten and left to decay. The final blow to this once-proud district came early in the Last War. A team of Aundairian saboteurs brought down one of Sharn's floating towers, and the falling spire struck Godsgate. Buildings collapsed, and hundreds died. Untended corpses led to infection and disease. The City Council had no interest in sinking gold into Lower Dura to restore the area, and the district was abandoned.

Today, the district known as Fallen is strewn with the rubble of the fallen tower, mingled with shattered buildings and broken statues. Those who venture into Fallen must deal with the Ravers, feral savages that lurk in the shadows. There's no question that the Ravers exist, but their true nature remains a subject of debate. A common hypothesis is that they're the descendants of the original inhabitants of the district, who were possessed and driven mad by the ghosts of those who died when the tower fell. Others claim that House Vadalis has been trying to magebreed super-soldiers, and the Ravers are the result of failed experiments.

Only the most desperate people live here, and the forces of the law won't come near it. As a result, the district has a lot of space available for any cult or secret society that needs a lair. The followers of a radiant idol, the Cult of the Dragon Below, or any other cabal could lay claim to a shattered church in Fallen.

### Khyber's Gate
Beyond the Cogs lies Khyber's Gate, a maze of tunnels and tenements carved into the stone. The Sharn Watch has no presence here, and the closest thing to an authority is the criminal organization known as Daask; if you're seeking the leaders of this group, this is where you'll find them. Many of the inhabitants of the Gate are goblins and immigrants from Droaam, but it's also home to fugitives, war criminals, and other unsavory types.

Khyber's Gate is part of the ruins of a goblin city that was abandoned thousands of years ago. No one knows how deep it goes. The monstrous inhabitants of the district have no love for treasure hunters or adventurers, and it's a dangerous place to explore.

Shamukaar is the most successful tavern in Khyber's Gate. The place is a safe haven for all within it, regardless of species or politics; once you make it through the door, you can breathe easy.

### The Sewers
The upper wards of Sharn use a network of chutes to funnel garbage down into the sewers. Refuse and filth is channeled into cavernous midden chambers, where it is left to rot or be devoured by the vermin and oozes that inhabit the sewers. Smaller tunnels channel wastewater into purification centers, where magewrights use magic to cleanse the water. A special unit of the Sharn Watch protects the purification chambers. Beyond these small, vital areas, the sewers are lawless.

Though the sewers were never intended to support a population, over the centuries a subculture has evolved in this region. A few tribes of people—mostly goblins, along with a few shifters, dwarves, and feral halflings—live in the sewers, rummaging through the midden heaps and selling their goods in the lower city. These sewer clans constantly battle over territory, as control of one or more midden chamber can be critical to survival. The sewer clans can pose a threat to adventurers, but they can also be valuable allies; there are no better guides to the sewers and what lies beneath them than one of the folk who live there.

## Criminal Activities
Under the laws of Sharn, crime takes many forms. Any sort of theft is illegal, including "malicious theft of identity"—the use of shapeshifting abilities or illusion magic to impersonate someone with the intent to cause harm. Assault, murder, and fraud will all land you in hot water. Other activities walk the edge of legality. Gambling and prostitution are legal in Sharn, but these industries are heavily taxed and regulated. Likewise, smuggled goods include illegal merchandise such as drugs and mystical explosives, but also heavily taxed goods, such as the drug known as dreamlily (described in *chapter 4*).

Although crime occurs throughout Sharn, it is most apparent in Lower Dura and the Cogs. The Sharn Watch has a minimal presence in these wards, which are the easiest places to sell stolen goods or to hire an assassin. Of course, they're also good places to get robbed or caught up in a street brawl.

Sharn is home to a large number of minor gangs and independent criminals. Even so, most criminal activities in the city come under the purview of one of four criminal organizations: the Boromar Clan, Daask, House Tarkanan, and the Tyrants. Even independents usually have an arrangement with one of these power groups. If your character has the criminal background, work with the DM to determine which of these organizations you're connected to (the DM has more information about these groups in *chapter 4*).

### The Boromar Clan
The Boromar Clan began as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Today the Boromars are one of Sharn's most influential families; there's a Boromar on the City Council. Also, the Boromars have close ties by marriage to the local branch of House Jorasco, and clan members can be seen at every Skyway gala.

The Boromar Clan specializes in gambling, theft, and smuggling. In addition, it governs a wide network of lesser gangs and crime lords across the city. In the past, the clan's reputation was sufficiently strong to prevent any challenges. Over the last decade, however, the Boromars have been fending off a serious challenge from Daask. Those monsters have been aggressively targeting Boromar agents and holdings, and the feud between the two forces grows more heated all the time.

Having a connection to the Boromar Clan makes you part of the established power in Sharn. It's an organization that values tradition and prefers to avoid violence. As an associate of the clan, you'll be expected to respect the hierarchy and follow the rules, and you might be targeted by Daask just as if you were a Boromar yourself.

If you have a contact in the Boromar Clan, you might know someone on the Boromar Contacts table.

### Daask
Founded by monstrous immigrants from Droaam, the criminal organization known as Daask has been building its power for a decade and has recently begun an aggressive campaign of expansion. Daask engages mainly in violent crime, including armed robbery, assault, arson, and murder. As its reputation has grown, it has added extortion to this list.

If you have a contact in Daask, you might know someone on the Daask Contacts table.

##### Daask Contacts

### House Tarkanan
House Tarkanan is an elite force of mercenary thieves and assassins. The criminal talents of the Tarkanans are enhanced by another trait they share: every member of the house possesses an aberrant dragonmark. Thus, every Tarkanan has an unpredictable magical gift—and all of them are united by the fear and prejudice that most aberrant heirs elicit from other people.

If you have a contact in House Tarkanan, you might know someone on the Tarkanan Contacts table.

## Forces of the Law
In Precarious, a dwarf tries to smuggle a portable hole filled with treasures pillaged from Xen'drik past the guards of the Sharn Watch.

In Clifftop, a patrol of guards calls on two dueling barbarians to throw down their weapons; the fierce warriors just snarl and rush at each other once more.

In the court of Upper Central, a magistrate orders the Justiciar of Aureon to blind the prisoner in preparation for his sentence of perpetual darkness.

The law is a force to be reckoned with in Sharn. Even in places where the watch is notoriously ineffective, those who would break the law still need to be wary of zealous guards resistant to bribes or threats.

### The Sharn Watch
The Sharn Watch is responsible for enforcing the laws of the city. The sentinels of the watch patrol the streets of Sharn, to all outward appearances vigilant for signs of unrest. In truth, the Sharn Watch is riddled with corruption, from the commanding officers down to the lowliest patrollers. Dedicated guards who truly want to protect the innocent do exist. But bribery nonetheless runs rampant, and the watch has a way of failing to show up somewhere at the same time that Daask or the Boromar Clan is perpetrating some misdeed. The DM can find more information on the watch in *chapter 4*.

![[103-3-08.png|right|300]](An Artificer, with Two Eldritch Cannons, Spies on a Member of the Sharn Watch)

### The King's Citadel
The members of the King's Citadel are the direct agents of the Brelish Crown. As such, the King's Citadel stands above the Sharn Watch. Its members have the authority to take control of any investigation and to command the service of any guard or sentinel. Typically the Citadel leaves the daily chores of law enforcement (including the conflicts between the criminal organizations of the lower towers) in the hands of the Sharn Watch. The Citadel is concerned with forces that threaten the entire city, or even the kingdom. Foreign spies, mad necromancers, and ancient fiends—these are the foes of the King's Citadel, rather than pickpockets and burglars.

Of course, many of these greater threats might be beyond the capabilities of the typical Citadel agents. Much as the Blackened Book does, the Citadel keeps a close eye on unusual and talented individuals, and a party of adventurers might be called upon to assist the Citadel in a dangerous mission.

Unlike the Sharn Watch, the Citadel doesn't ask for help: it demands it. The knights of the Citadel are the representatives of the King of Breland, and any Brelish citizen who refuses to help them is committing an act of treason. The Citadel isn't required to provide compensation for the services it demands, but an adventurer who wins the respect of the Citadel can certainly benefit from the relationship.

The Citadel is made up of these four divisions:

**The King's Dark Lanterns** gather intelligence and engage in covert operations.

**The King's Shields** protect the royal family and its closest associates.

**The King's Swords** are elite soldiers used in the most dangerous military operations.

**The King's Wands** are wizards and sorcerers, serving the crown in all arcane matters.

The headquarters of the Citadel is in the Ambassador Towers district of Middle Central, in Andith Tower. That structure also serves as the city jail.

### The Redcloak Battalion
The soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion are among the deadliest warriors in Sharn. When a situation calls for extreme military force, both the Sharn Watch and the King's Citadel turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought in the forefront of the Last War, and the bards in Menthis today sing of the exploits of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the battalion was split up, and one unit was assigned to Sharn. Its headquarters is located in the Daggerwatch district of Upper Dura.

Many of the members of the Redcloak Battalion resent being relegated to mere law enforcement, and there is a strong rivalry between the Redcloaks and the King's Swords of the Citadel, who generally have less military experience even though they enjoy far greater authority and prestige.

As veterans and heroes of the Last War, many of the Redcloaks are unfriendly toward travelers from other nations. As far as the Redcloaks are concerned, the Treaty of Thronehold is merely an intermission, and soon King Boranel will come to his senses and finish the job that Wroann ir'Wynarn began.

### Crimes and Punishments
Officers of the watch can levy fines on the spot when they catch culprits, which is the typical way that minor crimes are dealt with. For a serious offense, the perpetrator is taken to a garrison and held until a trial can be arranged. A criminal who is considered to be a serious flight risk will be taken to the most secure facility in Sharn—the King's Citadel headquarters.

Typically, a prisoner's case comes to the attention of a local magistrate within 1d4 days. The magistrate reviews the facts of the case and asks the victim to confirm or deny their role in the crime while under the influence of a *zone of truth* spell. The magistrate will then propose a punishment to the accused; if the offer is refused, the case goes to trial.

Punishment for convicted criminals varies, but long-term imprisonment is quite rare. Prisoners who deemed to be too dangerous to be allowed to roam free are more likely to be executed than imprisoned. Typically, a long prison sentence is used only for criminals who can't be allowed to go free, but whose deaths would have negative diplomatic repercussions.

Fines are the typical form of punishment. The amount of a fine is generally based on the nature of the crime, but a magistrate has the right to increase a fine to ensure that it is an effective punishment. For example, a fine of 10 gp is crippling to a commoner but can be inconsequential to an adventurer or a member of the Aurum, and in such cases it will be increased. Also, the court can confiscate possessions in lieu of receiving payments in gold; you might not care about having to pay a fine of 100 gp, but having your grandfather's magic sword confiscated instead might sting. If a criminal can't afford to pay a fine, the sentence might be changed to hard labor—or, in the case of adventurers, performing special services on behalf of the city or the Crown.

Other kinds of punishment include branding (generally in a visible location, warning others of your criminal actions), exile, or several magical measures: an ongoing curse, a period of induced blindness, and so on. A repeat offender might be declared an outlaw, which status is often indicated by a brand. An outlaw is stripped of the protection of the law, and anyone can take any action against them without fear of legal retribution.

# Chapter 4: Building Eberron Adventures
Get your own Eberron adventures up and running using the inspiration in this chapter. Eberron is filled with political intrigue, extraplanar threats, magical mysteries, and back-alley detective work—all in the context of a world emerging from the turmoil of war.

The tables and advice in this chapter expand on the material in *chapter 3* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Think of this chapter as an extensive library of ideas—villainous schemes, interesting locations, adventure hooks, encounters, and more—to help you flesh out an adventure you create for your Eberron campaign.

This chapter begins with a look at three key themes that pervade many Eberron adventures: recurring villains, action, and intrigue. Following that overview is an in-depth look at various organizations and other elements you can use to drive the adventures you create. Such elements include maps of locations that can serve as thrilling set pieces; information on the planes of existence, elemental-powered airships, and the lightning rail; and an introductory adventure set in Sharn.

Specific monsters and nonplayer characters (NPCs) mentioned in this chapter can be found either in the *Monster Manual* or in *chapter 6* of this book. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the *Monster Manual* or in chapter 6. If the stat block appears in chapter 6, the text tells you so.

![[104-4-01.jpg|right|300]](Passengers from all over Khorvaire disembark from a lightning train.)

## Adventure Themes
A group of adventurers leaves the dark, rainy city, putting its mean streets behind them. They board a flame-ringed airship for a journey across the continent, but they're attacked by wyvern-riding bandits on the way and must fight for their lives as the airship hurtles toward the ground!

After surviving the crash through a combination of quick thinking and heroic effort, they find themselves stranded in the gray mists of the Mournland, facing the dangers of a war-ravaged land as they try to find their way back to their original destination. The greatest horrors they are about to face might be the ones that lurk in the depths of their own hearts.

As discussed in the introduction to this book, pulp adventure and noir intrigue are two major themes that interlace in Eberron. Weaving these themes together, or exploring either one in isolation, can give Eberron stories a unique feel. Adventures that take advantage of those themes help to reinforce a sense of place, immersing the players (and you) in a world that is still reeling from the effects of a hundred years of war, that is shaped by modern ideas and aesthetics, and that is set apart from the rest of the D&D multiverse by a magical barrier.

This section is an introduction to those themes, designed to help you tell stories that fit well in Eberron. It explores techniques for making compelling recurring villains, and for keeping the action moving over the course of an adventure. It discusses how to use the Last War as a theme and a setting for adventures, and details the Mournland as an adventure location. It goes on to describe adventures and encounters that can occur in transit—on airships, on lightning rails, and at resting spots along the way. Finally, this section discusses the role that creatures typically defined as "monsters" play in Khorvaire, and explores Eberron's cosmology.

### Recurring Villains
The most effective villains are the ones that return, over and over, to plague their heroic nemeses. When the heroes foil the schemes of an evil mastermind, the clever villain escapes to fight another day. A well-developed recurring villain can put a face to the sinister conspiracies that lurk in the darkness and thus strengthen the players' sense of immersion in the world.

You can make a recurring villain in your campaign more intriguing by introducing moral ambiguity into the villain's background, possibly through references to the individual's experiences during the Last War.

>>

#### How to Keep Villains Alive
The first task in crafting a good recurring villain is ensuring that the villain survives a first encounter with the adventurers in order to come back and plague them again. What follows are some tactics to make sure that even the most resourceful characters can't dispose of your villain at the first possible opportunity.

**Have Lackeys Do the Work.** A villain can easily postpone that first face-to-face confrontation with the adventurers by having lackeys soften the party up, all the while making sure that the adventurers know whom they work for—thus enhancing the villain's reputation.

**Use All Available Resources.** A smart villain, especially one with access to magic, can put a lot of obstacles in the way of an adventuring party. Mechanical and magical traps, wards against divination, and protective magic items are just a few of the security measures available to a resourceful villain. Keep in mind that reports from surviving lackeys—and news about the adventurers from other sources—can give the villain enough information about the party's capabilities to prepare appropriate countermeasures.

**Have an Escape Plan.** Secret passages, spells of invisibility or teleportation, flying mounts, and throngs of minions can help a villain escape when a confrontation with the adventurers goes badly. Any villain likely has at least one fallback plan.

**Take Hostages**. Most adventurers wouldn't be willing to attack the villain if they fear that the villains' lackeys are about to slaughter innocent captives the moment they draw their swords.

**Returning from Death**. Of course, death is not a final fate for player characters, and it doesn't need to be for villains either. After the adventurers kill their nemesis, they might next encounter the villain raised from the dead or as an undead. It's conceivable that dying could make a villain more powerful and more angry at the meddling adventurers. Alternatively, the characters might assume a villain is dead—after falling over a waterfall, being trapped in a burning building, or getting swallowed by a purple worm—only to discover later that the villain survived and is hungry for revenge.

#### Improving Villains
Adventurers get more powerful over time, so if a villain is going to remain a relevant threat, the villain needs to get more powerful as well. There are three ways you can approach this issue:

**Mechanical Improvement**. Use the guidelines in *chapter 9* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to add class levels or Hit Dice to the villain and improve its challenge rating to make it relevant to the higher-level characters.

**NPC Stat Blocks**. Some of the stat blocks in the *Monster Manual* can reflect the same character at different stages of advancement. For example, the adventurers might confront a villain who uses the stat block of a **mage** (9th-level wizard) and then returns later as an **archmage** (18th-level wizard). You could also use stat blocks in other sources to add to the sequence, so the characters could even meet this aspiring villain as an **apprentice wizard** and later as an **evoker** (both in *Volo's Guide to Monsters*).

**Organizations as Villains**. Rather than use an individual as a recurring villain, you could think in terms of the organization the villain belongs to or represents. For example, low-level adventurers might fight low-level agents of the Order of the Emerald Claw and grow to loathe the sight of their claw-shaped symbol and green cloaks. As they attain higher levels, the characters will face increasingly more powerful members of the order.

#### Shades of Evil
Moral ambiguity is a feature of the noir genre that can add richness and complexity to an Eberron adventure. In a world where a red dragon isn't necessarily evil (and a bronze one isn't necessarily good), it's impossible to know who you can trust, and even the actions of a so-called villain might not fit neatly into clear-cut definitions of good and evil. Even adventure villains are more often driven by human motives than by cosmic concepts of good and evil. People sometimes do evil things for good reasons.

Exercise some caution when exploring these noir themes in the stories you develop. It can be fun for some people to wrestle with moral quandaries in adventures, but it doesn't work for all play groups. In particular, if there's no good solution to the quandary—if the characters have no choice but to follow a course of action they abhor—some players might end up unhappy.

The Morally Ambiguous Villains table offers some twists you can add to the villains in this chapter, giving them more or less good reasons to perform their evil deeds.

##### Morally Ambiguous Villains
| d4 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The villain is targeting people with aberrant dragonmarks in the desperate hope of preventing another War of the Mark. |
| 2 | The villain is suffering under a terrible curse, and their increasingly serious crimes are an effort to fight off the curse. |
| 3 | The villain is rising to power through entirely legal means, winning popular support (through generous campaign promises) and working within the system. |
| 4 | The villain's schemes are directed at preventing the release of a demonic overlord. |

#### The Villain You Know
Not every villain is a mastermind who schemes in the shadows or a world-destroying horror. Sometimes the most significant villain is someone the characters see every day—someone who moves around society in plain sight but keeps their evil deeds well hidden. The law enforcers and adventurers who are trying to bring the villain to justice are thwarted at every turn, unable to find proof of the villain's crimes. If the players come to loathe the villain, everything is going according to plan.

Use the Villain You Know table to add some depth and detail to the actions and motivations of a villain who plagues the characters on a regular basis.

##### Villain You Know
| d6 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A con artist takes advantage of people who fall for their scams, but leaves behind no proof of any crime. |
| 2 | A cowardly politician fleeces the poor of their last few coins without technically doing anything wrong. |
| 3 | A righteous zealot is continually poking into the characters' business, judging their actions and methods while doing even worse things in the shadows. |
| 4 | A powerful figure in a dragonmarked house is using the house's resources for criminal deeds, but there's no trail of evidence leading back to the villain. |
| 5 | A crime lord has the local authorities on the payroll, so no official action will ever be taken to stop their criminal activities. |
| 6 | A villainous mastermind cooperates with local law enforcement to track down and eliminate rival villains, without ever giving the authorities a peek into their own evil deeds. |

#### The Mysterious Villain
![[105-4-02.png|right|300]]

In contrast to a villain who is a part of the characters' everyday life, an otherworldly villain isn't only anonymous but also fundamentally mysterious. It's not just a question of *who* the villain is, but also of *what* the villain is, and what extraordinary measures might be required to put a stop to their villainy. Even after the adventurers discover that their long-term nemesis is one of the Inspired, for example, they still need to learn the secrets of the Inspired and their quori masters in order to figure out how to deal with this threat.

Sometimes the mystery is enough to make such a villain compelling, with curiosity driving the adventurers to delve ever deeper into their foe's secrets. When the time is right, you can turn a mysterious villain into an unnervingly familiar villain—as a quori spirit takes delight in speaking through the mouths of multiple different Inspired hosts, taunting the adventurers for their inability to reach the spirit itself. Then resentment combines with curiosity to drive the adventurers to further exploration. When characters dig deeply into the mysteries of the world, your campaign benefits as they become more immersed in and attached to the setting.

***Ultimate Evil.*** Some mysterious villains wield enough power to threaten the entire world through colossal strength, mastery of magic, dizzying intellect, or overwhelming charisma (or often some combination of these factors). These villains typically lurk in the shadows, pulling the strings of minions and partners while rarely making an appearance themselves. These villains are especially hard to get rid of, even if they are banished or imprisoned—their magic and their network of servants ensure that their reach extends far beyond their physical presence.

***Driving Forces.*** Most villains in this category are numbered among the driving forces described later in this chapter. You can use the Villain You Don't Understand table to choose one of these forces, then consult the adventure seeds and villain ideas in the appropriate section.

##### Villain You Don't Understand
| d6 | Driving Force |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | *The Chamber* |
| 2 | *The Cults of the Dragon Below* |
| 3 | *The Daughters of Sora Kell* |
| 4 | *The Dreaming Dark* |
| 5 | *The Lords of Dust* |
| 6 | *The Order of the Emerald Claw* |

### Action!
Adventures in the pulp tradition tend to start with a bang and proceed at a breakneck pace, reaching a climax in pulse-pounding encounters aboard high-speed vehicles and grand melees in dramatic locations. Action doesn't have to mean combat, but ensuring that the world is in constant motion around the player characters is a good way to keep their interest high.

#### Kicking Off the Action
When you begin an adventure with a bang, you catch the characters up in the action right away, grabbing their interest and sending them off on a wild ride. The Story Kickoff table offers some action-packed ways to get things moving.

##### Story Kickoff
| d6 | Event |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | On a quiet night, the tavern door bursts open and a group of soldiers calls for one of the party members by name. |
| 2 | An explosion rocks a market, sending things flying. |
| 3 | A vehicle crashes near the party: people are hurt and need help, and whatever caused the crash is still around somewhere. |
| 4 | Two groups of people start fighting each other, blood is drawn, and bystanders are getting hurt. |
| 5 | Chanting words of the Draconic Prophecy, a dragon appears and starts causing mayhem. |
| 6 | A tavern patron suddenly leaps up and attacks one of the adventurers, scratching and biting in blind fury. |

#### Keeping the Action Going
"When in doubt, have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand." Author Raymond Chandler offered this advice to writers of hard-boiled fiction, but the advice applies just as well to an action-driven adventure. Whenever the pace of the story lags, a new injection of excitement keeps things moving.

A new arrival on the scene might be an integral part of the plot or an independent event. The New Development table presents some ideas.

##### New Development
| d8 | Event |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | One or more minions of the adventure's primary villain arrive to put a stop to the party's meddling. |
| 2 | Someone else with the same goal as the party shows up to get them out of the way. |
| 3 | Someone is out for revenge against the party for a past wrong (perhaps something that happened in a previous adventure). |
| 4 | Someone has a violent argument with an NPC in the same room as the adventurers. |
| 5 | Someone wants a special item carried by one of the characters. |
| 6 | A jealous person thinks one of the adventurers is meddling with the person's romantic partner. |
| 7 | A person in love with the villain tries to stop the party from interfering with the villain's business. |
| 8 | A monster bursts in looking for food. |

### Intrigue
Stories in the noir tradition tend to start slowly and build gradually as the mystery gets deeper and more convoluted, until the situation erupts in a climactic confrontation. In contrast to the pulse-pounding action of a pulp adventure, noir typically relies on intrigue—in every sense of the word—to keep the protagonists engaged as they move deeper into the story.

#### Setting the Stage
Putting a mystery in front of the characters at the very start of the adventure sets the tone for what's ahead and draws them in to the story. The Story Opening table offers some ways to draw the characters into the mystery.

##### Story Opening
| d6 | Event |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The party receives a detailed reading from a street fortune-teller that lays out the start of the adventure. |
| 2 | A courier escorts the party to an elemental airship, where a wealthy patron outlines their mission. |
| 3 | At an extravagant costume ball, a masked guest asks for the party's help. |
| 4 | In a seedy section of town, the disguised heir of a dragonmarked house approaches the characters with an offer. |
| 5 | A **homunculus** delivers an anonymous letter that contains an offer of employment, but no clue to the author's identity. |
| 6 | A professor from Morgrave University reaches out to one of the party members, a former student, to ask an important favor. |

#### The Plot Thickens
A key point in most intrigue adventures is a significant plot twist. As you plan the trail of clues, events, and interactions, consider a point where you can shake things up with a twist like the ones shown on The Plot Thickens table.

##### The Plot Thickens
| d8 | Plot Twist |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The apparent victim in the situation is actually the villain. |
| 2 | A supposedly valuable object is actually worthless (or vice versa). |
| 3 | A valuable object doesn't belong to the person who claims to own it. |
| 4 | What's actually precious is not a work of art but a map or other information hidden on it (inside a statue, behind a painting in the frame, and so on). |
| 5 | Someone is in love with one of the party members, or with the villain. |
| 6 | Someone is a relative of one of the party members. |
| 7 | A friend or former ally is working with the villain. |
| 8 | The initial plot is a distraction from the actual plot. |

## The Aurum
On the surface, the Aurum appears to be an exclusive society for the richest and most influential people of Khorvaire. Merchants, priests, military officers, and other luminaries gather for grand galas and salons. Beneath this gilded veneer, the members of the Aurum use their shared wealth and power to pursue their selfish goals, and a secret cabal at the heart of this fraternity dreams of global domination.

The Aurum is divided into four suborders called Concords—copper, silver, gold, and platinum, in order of ascendance. Higher rank provides a member with improved access to the resources of the Aurum and a greater voice in society meetings. The Aurum isn't a secret society, and its meeting halls can be found in most major cities. Many powerful people openly wear the eight rings—one on each finger, with the metal indicating the rank of the wearer—that label them as Aurum members. The Aurum frequently engages in acts of philanthropy, and thus some members might be celebrated by their local communities.

When members gather, they discuss shared interests, especially in history and archaeology. Aurum members often take an interest in a particular civilization or era of history; one Concordian collects relics of the Cul'sir giants of Xen'drik, while another pursues artifacts of the dragons of Argonnessen. One of the most common ways in which adventurers cross paths with the Aurum is through these collectors. Members of the Aurum often fund expeditions to exotic lands or newly discovered ruins, interested in expanding their private hoards. Occasionally a Concordian tries to acquire prized relics through less honorable means; adventurers could be employed to acquire an exotic prize from a rival through any means necessary, legal or otherwise.

All of these activities are entirely legitimate. The Aurum is a society for wealthy scholars and philanthropists. But there is a secret order that ranks higher than the Platinum Concord—an inner circle known as the Shadow Cabinet. The members of this cabal are nobles but not kings; they are powerful industrialists, but not dragonmarked barons. They are determined to become the true rulers of Khorvaire, whether by binding the current barons and monarchs to their will or by tearing down the current systems and creating something new.

In stories driven by action, the Aurum can fund expeditions to exotic lands and use magical doomsday devices to hold cities for ransom. In adventures driven by intrigue, the Aurum provides an opportunity to explore the lure of gold, and how far the characters might go in the service of an amoral patron.

### The Aurum and the War
The Last War gave birth to the Shadow Cabinet. The war ignited the passions of Concordians who blamed the monarchs of the Five Nations for the vast devastation and loss. It also created opportunities that never existed under the united Galifar. Many of the members of the Aurum gained influence by bankrolling one or more war efforts, or by stepping in to maintain the infrastructure while the government directed its attention to military matters. The Aurum also includes a number of powerful military officers and warlords. Some despise the nobles that drove them to war; others are furious that the war ended without a decisive victory. Either way, these can provide the Shadow Cabinet with unexpected military power.

Now, amid the war's cooling ashes, the Aurum's power is fragmented. On several occasions, investments and gambles that paid dividends in money and power to one Concordian sapped the fortune of another, because each was unknowingly working against the other's interests. Huge collections of art, historical artifacts, and precious tomes were destroyed or lost during the war, and the Aurum's leaders salivate at the thought of recovering some of those riches.

### Aurum NPCs
Aurum Concordians are defined by their wealth and power. When you create an Aurum NPC, consider the source of that person's wealth and how it is expressed. The dwarf Antus ir'Soldorak is chancellor of the Platinum Concord and founder of the Shadow Cabinet. He owns vast gold and silver mines in the Mror Holds and mints his own currency, and he travels in a gilded airship. Loyal Daison is a Karrnathi slumlord who has made a fortune providing low-rent (and low-quality) housing for refugees. He lost his hand in an industrial accident and had it replaced with a golden prosthetic.

Members of the Aurum become villains if their quest for greater influence, personal power, and wealth victimizes the innocent. Whether villains or allies, all Concordians wield significant political influence. They have access to minions and resources in the higher levels of society. They prefer to pursue schemes of coercion and conspiracy, putting their money and influence to work, than resort to blatant violence in any form.

##### Aurum NPCs
| d4 | NPC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An aging dwarf—a retired general and an Aurum Concordian—collects unusual constructs, hoping to find a way to transfer his mind into a superior body. |
| 2 | An Aurum Concordian is renowned for having the finest arcane library in Khorvaire. Adventurers might help them collect more tome, but when a number of prominent wizards are murdered and their research goes missing, is the Concordian to blame? |
| 3 | A member of the Gold Concord is on the run from the Aurum after learning a terrible secret. |
| 4 | An imprisoned Concordian mobilizes a network of contacts and well-placed Aurum members in order to secure their own release. |

### Aurum Campaign Themes
It's easy to introduce the Aurum to the characters early in a campaign. Its members are public figures, sometimes eccentric but not necessarily evil. A Concordian could hire the adventurers to solve a mystery or to acquire a harmless curio. A Concordian could be tied to the party's group patron (see *chapter 1*)—the owner of the newspaper, a major donor to the university, or the power behind a criminal syndicate.

Alternatively, an Aurum Concordian can be a behind-the-scenes villain: low-level adventurers could clash with the Concordian's hired goons as they pursue the same treasure, or the adventurers could be trying to solve a mystery the thugs are covering up. As the campaign progresses, the characters might face higher-ranking members of the Aurum, or recurring mercenaries who are increasing in power and status at the same rate they are.

Whether they interact with the Aurum as ally or enemy, at some point the adventurers might well realize that the Concordians aren't just greedy plutocrats, but participants in an international conspiracy. The Aurum's arc in the campaign might climax with the characters learning of the Shadow Cabinet and thwarting one of its grand schemes.

### Aurum Missions
The Aurum Missions table suggests a variety of assignments that adventurers might be asked to undertake on behalf of the Aurum or one of its members, whether or not they're aware of their patron's affiliation.

##### Aurum Missions
| d6 | Mission |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Retrieve a journal from a ship that sailed to Xen'drik and never returned. |
| 2 | Locate the grave of a certain dragonmarked scion, and retrieve the signet buried with them. |
| 3 | Make friends with a scholar at the local university and learn their vices. |
| 4 | Recover a trove of art, artifacts, or recorded knowledge that was thought lost in a battle during the Last War. |
| 5 | Capture an officer from a rival nation's army, or convince the officer to defect, to gain access to their specialized knowledge. |
| 6 | Sabotage the negotiations between a dragonmarked house and the local government on a plan that will undermine the Aurum's status. |

## Cults of the Dragon Below
The Cults of the Dragon Below are made up of people fanatically devoted to the daelkyr or the fiendish overlords (both described in *chapter 6*). Though some choose this path, most are drawn to it by strange visions and corrupting madness. Like weeds breaking through the foundation of Khorvaire, Cults of the Dragon Below can spring up anywhere, at any time.

Unlike other organizations with global reach, the cults have no organizing structure or principle. They are an infection inflicted on the world without reason. "Cult of the Dragon Below" is a term that outsiders use to describe any sect devoted to the daelkyr or the overlords. Each cult pursues its own mad schemes, tied to its dark patron. Even cults associated with the same master might not recognize one another as allies. You can roll on the Cult of the Dragon Below table to get a quick description of a cult, or you can create something entirely new. Whatever purpose cultists find or create for themselves from their twisted devotions, they pursue it with fanaticism. Even the most urbane and cultured cult leaders are unwavering in their convictions, entirely sure that their beliefs are good, true, and just.

##### Cults of the Dragon Below
| d8 | Cult |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A cult of **Belashyrra** murders innocents and steals their eyes, magically preserving the image of the last thing the eyes beheld. The cultists collect the eyes in a deep vault, while new eyes grow in strange places on their own bodies. |
| 2 | A cult of **Dyrrn the Corrupter** seeks to transcend humanity by bonding with aberrations and symbionts. |
| 3 | A cult of Kyrzin, the daelkyr Prince of Slime, keeps a **gibbering mouther** in the basement and feeds their elders to this creature, believing their voices can still be heard in the whispers of the beast. |
| 4 | A cult of **Rak Tulkhesh** believes that this life is only a stepping stone, and members earn a path to paradise by spilling blood and spreading strife. |
| 5 | A cult of **Belashyrra** serves a **beholder** messiah, believing that only the eye tyrant has the vision to lead them to a golden age. |
| 6 | A cult of **Dyrrn** led by a **mind flayer** kidnaps people with dragonmarks, seeking to decipher the marks and transfer them to others. |
| 7 | An arcane think tank has become a cult of **Sul Khatesh**; the members believe they can heal the damage of the Mourning, but the eldritch machine they are building will surely cause more horror. |
| 8 | A cult of **Rak Tulkhesh** has sprung up among a local militia. Its members are convinced that refugees from the war are secretly inhuman monsters, and must be destroyed. |

### The Cults and the War
The war and its aftermath created a fertile breeding ground for the Cults of the Dragon Below. In this time of uncertainty and fear, it's easy for people to gravitate toward a group that provides a sense of purpose or a promise of security. This mindset is intensified by the spread of refugees in the wake of the Mourning, and by the lingering animosity that continues to divide people. In the Mror Holds, the conflict with **Dyrrn the Corruptor** has begun to leave its mark, with new cults appearing throughout the nation. In general, the chaos of the war has left behind ample areas of shadow in which new cults can form and thrive.

### Cults of the Dragon Below NPCs
Some Cults of the Dragon Below are bizarre yet harmless, but most of them are dangerous and destructive forces that prey on innocents and vulnerable people. Some cultists are aware of the true nature of the beings they serve, but many are delusional; cultists might perceive their mind flayer master as a wise and gentle priest.

##### Cult NPCs
| d8 | NPC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A monstrous aberration (such as a **beholder**, a **mind flayer**, or a **gibbering mouther**) lairs beneath a popular inn, from where it twists the thoughts and dreams of those sleeping above. |
| 2 | The headmaster of an exclusive magic academy is actually a cult leader who is indoctrinating the students into a cult of **Sul Khatesh**. |
| 3 | A wizard found mad scrawlings hidden in a library book, used the writing to make contact with a daelkyr, and began creating aberration servants. |
| 4 | A **mind flayer** serving **Dyrrn** dominates a magistrate and takes control of the city watch using **intellect devourers**. |
| 5 | An assassin mixes mind-altering poisons laced with the whispers of a dark entity. |
| 6 | A dragonmarked heir whose fortunes were ruined in the Last War founds a cult within their house. |
| 7 | The local thieves' guild turns from mundane organized crime activities to bizarre murders and acts of chaos. |
| 8 | A respected noble behaves more erratically as time goes on, treating their servants and family with random and escalating cruelty. |

### Cult Campaign Themes
Cults of the Dragon Below make versatile villains in a campaign. They can be introduced as a threat early on, in the form of low-level cultists and small, disorganized cells. As the campaign moves through the tiers of play, stronger aberrations and fiends become viable antagonists, as well as more powerful cult leaders who serve the daelkyr, the Lords of Dust, or other dark entities.

The cults can also serve different styles of play. One would be perfect for a slowly unfolding investigation that starts out seemingly mundane, but slowly delves deeper into otherworldly influences and dark magic. Allies become suspect, and perhaps even erstwhile enemies become necessary bedfellows.

Alternatively, a cult can burst explosively onto the scene with a spray of gore and a horde of shrieking dolgaunts. Such an incident leaves no doubt about the cultists' evil nature, making them the obvious villains of the story.

### Cult Adventures
The Cult Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for story opportunities involving the cults.

## Dragonmarked Houses
No other group exerts as much influence over the Five Nations as the combined membership of the dragonmarked houses. Each dragonmarked house is part noble family and part business cartel, involved in businesses ranging from hospitality to espionage-for-hire.

The reach of the houses is so extensive that they have interests in every facet of life in the civilized lands of Khorvaire and beyond. Those interests often bring them into conflict with local rulers and national governments. Unified Galifar had the strength and influence to impose its will on the collected dragonmarked houses, but in the wake of the war it remains to be seen if any single nation has the resources to challenge them.

Although most houses have distinct spheres of interest, their concerns overlap just enough to cause friction. House Orien's control of transportation and shipping is threatened by the growing reach of House Lyrandar's airships. House Tharashk's arrangement with Droaam threatens House Deneith's monopoly on providing mercenary services. House Cannith lost its leadership in the Mourning, and rival barons are fighting for control of the house.

An organization called the Twelve seeks to mediate disputes and encourage cooperation between the houses. Adventurers could be caught up in the rivalries and schemes of the houses, or they could work with the Twelve in an effort to resolve these feuds.

### The Houses in the War
The dragonmarked houses generally thrived during the Last War. Each house's unique talents were easily adapted to the war effort. Ostensibly neutral in the conflict, the houses made huge profits by selling services and material to every nation involved in the war. For all the houses, ultimately, the war years were a time of vigorous growth and increased influence.

In some ways, though, the dragonmarked houses did feel the brunt of the conflict. House Cannith, for instance, suffered great setbacks near the end of the war. Many of its foundries and factories were destroyed, and the Treaty of Thronehold forced the house to dismantle the creation forges that produced the warforged. Worst of all for the house, the destruction of Cyre left Cannith without a clear leader, resulting in the house being fragmented into three semi-independent branches.

In another major development, House Thuranni broke away from House Phiarlan during the war, in part because of the conflicts of interest that arose within an espionage organization that was being called on to serve multiple sides in a complex conflict.

### Arcane Workshop
Map 4.1 depicts an arcane workshop, of a sort commonly constructed by the fabricators of House Cannith. These facilities are well stocked with raw materials, artisans' tools, and magical reagents. Most of them have small libraries containing works related to the workshop's signature creations.

#### Arcane Workshop Features
Arcane workshops have many features in common, from workbenches and tools to diagrams etched into the floors and walls. Although most workshops are controlled by House Cannith, that house is not the only group of artificers who build and operate such locations. Zil gnomes who bind elementals and Mror dwarves who forge powerful weapons and armor must have spaces devoted to that work. The wizards of Arcanix in Aundair who create magic items and test new spells build specialized workshops for those purposes.

#### Arcane Workshop Adventures
Characters might find their way to an arcane workshop for a variety of reasons. Some possibilities are outlined in the Arcane Workshop Adventures table.

### Dragonmarked NPCs
The reach and influence of the dragonmarked houses means that they can play many roles in a campaign. Dragonmarked heirs can be valuable patrons. Dragonmarked villains usually covet magical knowledge, wealth, or influence, and their methods are appropriate to the marks they bear. Dragonmarked agents can range from lowly spies bearing the Mark of Shadow hidden within a circus troupe, to a dragonmarked warlord of House Deneith who has decided to establish their own fiefdom. Examples of NPCs from dragonmarked houses appear in the Dragonmarked NPCs table.

##### Dragonmarked NPCs

### Dragonmarked House Campaign Themes
The dragonmarked houses provide an opportunity for your campaign to explore the role of magic in society and the power of industry in the postwar world. If the adventurers are allied with a dragonmarked house, you can concentrate on the house's positive aspects and its work in moving Khorvaire beyond the feudalism of Galifar. At the same time, the houses also represent a way to explore the consequences of corporate greed and unrestrained expansion. This self-interest can be a defining feature of some or all of the houses, or you can focus on factions within certain houses, with idealistic leaders seeking to direct the house along a more responsible path while barons are driven by greed alone.

As a prominent part of society, the dragonmarked houses strive to maintain the appearance of respectability and propriety. Thus, even when a house is utterly corrupted, any agents who are caught in their evil deeds are quickly and convincingly disavowed, preserving the house's image and reputation. If the plays a significant, recurring role as a villain in your campaign, the characters' eventual task will be to prove that these so-called "rogue agents" have actually been taking orders from the top of the house's leadership.

### Dragonmarked House Adventure Hooks
The Dragonmarked House Adventure Hooks table presents a few ways to pull characters into tales concerning the houses.

##### Dragonmarked House Adventure Hooks

## Dragons
The dragons of Eberron are much more than mere monsters; adventurers will rarely barge into a dragon's lair in search of its treasure horde. Dragons in the world are either aloof and unapproachable, or they are curious and manipulative, pulling strings behind the scenes or trying to influence the world in arcane ways.

Most dragons live on the mystery-shrouded continent of Argonnessen and avoid contact with those they see as lesser creatures. They are obsessed with the Draconic Prophecy, which is a map of possible futures rather than a clear-cut prediction. Its paths are revealed in the motion of planes and moons, in the actions of the dragonmarked houses, and in dozens of other more subtle manifestations. Most dragons that are active in Khorvaire are part of a cabal known as the Chamber.

A dragon in Khorvaire that isn't part of the Chamber could be an exile driven from Argonnessen for some crime or a scholar pursuing independent research. Some orphaned dragons grow up in Khorvaire without contact with Argonnessen, and some dragons have been twisted by the daelkyr or corrupted by fiends; any of these could be an antagonist if the adventure you're crafting calls for a cruel dragon.

The dragons of Eberron aren't restricted in alignment—good red dragons and evil gold dragons are equally common. Most dragons tend toward neutrality. Even those with good alignments often don't consider the impact of their actions on lesser beings; if a Chamber dragon must destroy a human village to foil the plans of a demon, it will do so without hesitation.

### The Chamber
Conspiracy theorists insist that a network of dragons is hidden in Khorvaire, and these mighty creatures use powerful magic and humanoid agents to work their will across the continent and beyond. These claims are usually dismissed as madness, but they are in fact correct. The Chamber is a cabal of dragons that have monitored Khorvaire for thousands of years, treating humanoids as pawns in an ancient game.

First and foremost, the dragons of the Chamber are observers, gathering information about new aspects of the Prophecy and sharing it with their elders in Argonnessen. They are also charged with stopping any creature that seeks to use the Prophecy for its own ends. This responsibility sets them against the Lords of Dust, who must manipulate the Prophecy in order to release their fiendish overlords. It also leads them to recruit or eliminate any humanoid who learns too much about the Prophecy.

The Chamber is loosely organized. Each dragon monitors its own small corner of the world and maintains a network of humanoid agents. Although the mission of the Chamber is one of observation, individual dragons often have their own agendas. Some seek to manipulate the Prophecy personally, directing the future along a particular path. Others conduct experiments on dragonmarked humanoids, trying to understand the connection between these creatures and the Prophecy. Still others are obsessed with the Lords of Dust engage in century-spanning games of cat-and-mouse with their fiendish counterparts. In general, the Chamber seeks to maintain the status quo and opposes demons, so agents of the Chamber can often be useful allies or patrons. But ultimately humanoids are just pawns in the dragons' eyes, and they readily sacrifice any of those pawns to ensure the sanctity of the Prophecy and the defeat of the Lords of Dust.

#### The Chamber and the War
The lives of humanoids and the welfare of their nations mean little to the ancient dragons. A member of the Chamber who is friendly now might turn out to be little more than a war criminal, responsible for horrible atrocities while directing critical events of the war to ensure that a skirmish or an untimely assassination didn't derail some crucial stanza of the Prophecy. An even more disturbing prospect is that the Mourning might have been orchestrated by the Chamber, either as part of its struggle against the Lords of Dust or even directly in response to the dictates of the Prophecy.

Whatever the truth, the Last War's impact on the Chamber was small in the grand scheme of things. Planar observatories were damaged here and there, humanoid servants died in droves, and the clash of armies derailed short-term plans. But even the effects of a hundred years of war are minor in the context of plans that span continents and millennia.

### Planar Observatory
A planar observatory is a structure at the heart of the Chamber's efforts to divine the meaning of the draconic Prophecy. The observatory consists of great chambers of crystal and metal, lined with huge orreries that track and align with the planes and the Ring of Siberys.

#### Planar Observatory Features
Map 4.2 shows what a planar observatory might look like. These immense locations are constructed by and for dragons. The orreries that surround the central space track the courses of the planes as they shift toward and away from Eberron. All about the observatory are enormous dragonshards of all three kinds (Eberron, Khyber, and Siberys).

Each observatory must be built in a location that is balanced between Siberys and Khyber; finding such a site might take years of careful study and surveying, and these places are typically remote. Several are located in Argonnessen; those in Khorvaire are usually found in mountain ranges and hidden forest clearings. Many have crystal roofs, or domes that open with the aid of great mechanisms to allow an unobstructed view of the night sky, since the movements of Eberron's moons are thought to correspond to the shifting relationships among the planes.

#### Planar Observatory Adventures
The characters might find their way to a planar observatory as unwitting minions of a Chamber observer, as a destination in their struggles against servants of the Lords of Dust, or even accidentally. The Planar Observatory Adventures table presents some possibilities.

![[109-map42_planarobservatory-player.jpg|right|300]]((Player Version))
##### Planar Observatory Adventures
| d8 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A disguised dragon requests assistance repairing a damaged orrery within the observatory. |
| 2 | One of the character's contacts is secretly the servant of a Chamber dragon observer. When the contact goes missing, their notes point toward a hidden "library" in the mountains. |
| 3 | The planar observatory might offer a way to prevent or at least predict what seems to be an epidemic of destructive manifest zones. |
| 4 | An observatory has been taken over by demonic cultists, and the characters must reclaim the facility or destroy it before the cult makes use of it. |
| 5 | A dragonmarked character has recurring nightmares that lead them to the observatory. |
| 6 | A thief or assassin has been using a derelict observatory as a hideout, occasionally selling bits of the observatory's dragonshards and equipment. |
| 7 | A scholar hires the characters to assist with studying and restoring a rediscovered observatory. |
| 8 | Several observatories across the region will produce a powerful effect if each is brought into a specific, simultaneous alignment. |

#### Chamber NPCs
The dragons of the Chamber typically use magic to disguise their true nature and move unseen among humanoids. Although their goals of acquiring knowledge and opposing the Lords of Dust can make the dragons suitable as allies, their devotion to their long-term interests can blind them to the short-term impact of their actions.

##### Chamber NPCs
| d6 | NPC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A wizard agent of the Chamber seeks to eliminate all the people they worked with in the past to cover their tracks and preserve the Chamber's secrecy. |
| 2 | The Prophecy requires the eventual destruction of a humanoid city. A disguised silver dragon, cunning and subtle, works to destabilize the city and bring about its ruin. |
| 3 | A local librarian is a disguised gold dragon in the service of the Chamber, who provides useful leads to send the characters down paths vital to the Prophecy. |
| 4 | A dragon becomes convinced that the dragonmarked houses are corrupting the Prophecy. It might specifically target dragonmarked heirs, or start a popular movement that seeks to destroy the houses. |
| 5 | A royal advisor or prominent noble, secretly a servant of the Chamber, guides the leader in a direction vital to the Prophecy but disastrous to the region. |
| 6 | A disguised dragon is convinced that an adventurer has a critical role to play in the Prophecy, but an agent of the Lords of Dust is determined to drive them down a different path. |

### Chamber Campaign Themes
In a campaign featuring the Chamber, the adventurers might initially carry out simple tasks on behalf of a disguised dragon or secret Chamber agent, not necessarily doing anything shady or villainous, but maneuvering pieces into position so they can play their designated parts. As the campaign unfolds, the dragons of the Chamber might reveal that the adventurers have their own part to play—in particular, perhaps, any member of the party who bears a dragonmark. The Chamber begins interfering in the characters' activities, for good and for ill, and the Lords of Dust might also get involved. Unfortunately for the adventurers, the dragons are not necessarily any more concerned for their well-being than the Lords of Dust are, and the characters might have to consort or cooperate with demons in order to escape the clutches of the dragons.

Throughout the campaign, the goals of the Chamber might not be readily apparent. Locations such as the planar observatory described here might be able to give the adventurers some insight into the substance of the Prophecy they have become tangled up in, and seers and sages might be able to offer further insight into the different ways that the demons and the dragons could be interpreting those words. Ultimately, the adventurers might be in the position of having to choose between an outcome that is bad for them but good for the world in the long term, or a short-term triumph that carries tremendous risk for the world in the distant (or not too distant) future.

Another possibility is that the adventurers are openly working with the Chamber to gather information on the Prophecy and fight the Lords of Dust. In this case, the Chamber could act as a group patron; see the "*Immortal Being*" section of *chapter 1*.

### Chamber Missions
The Chamber Missions table suggests several ways that adventurers might (knowingly or unknowingly) be asked to advance the Chamber's agenda, while the Chamber Adventures table offers a few more ways in which the activities of the Chamber could lead to an adventure.

##### Chamber Missions
| d6 | Mission |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Gather pristine dragonshards to expand or repair an observatory. |
| 2 | Seek out a group of people who must be eliminated in order to bring about the fulfillment of a stanza of Prophecy. |
| 3 | Discover who killed another minion of the characters' dragon patron. |
| 4 | Defend a Chamber safe house against a rival draconic attack. |
| 5 | Steal a local sage's research to prevent them from discovering the Chamber's activities. |
| 6 | Recreate an ancient ritual that will bring a new piece of the Prophecy to light. |

## The Dreaming Dark
In the spaces between sleeping and waking, nightmares wait with grasping claws. The quori spirits that rule Dal Quor spent a thousand years seizing control of the continent of Sarlona. Now they have turned their many eyes toward Khorvaire. The ultimate goal of the Dreaming Dark is to control all the nations of the world. The plane of Dal Quor goes through cycles of light and darkness, and the current age is coming to an end. The nightmare spirits that rule the plane believe that by seizing control of mortal civilization—by forcing all the people of Eberron to dream the dreams they devise—they can maintain this current age of darkness indefinitely. So the fiends of the Dreaming Dark aren't merely hungry for power; they are fighting for survival.

The quori can't manifest physically in Eberron, but they have other options. They can possess willing humanoids, creating agents known as the **Inspired** (see *chapter 6*). They can also manipulate the dreams of mortals. The Dreaming Dark can trick a priest by sending dreams that appear to be divine visions, or inspire a soldier to rebel against their lord.

The greatest weapon of the Dreaming Dark is its ability to infiltrate other organizations. Anyone could become an Inspired vessel, or be prompted into taking foolish action by a dream. Its agents are scattered across the world and have no obvious connection to one another, until they reveal their true nature and purpose.

### The Dreaming Dark in the War
The chaos that reigned during the Last War enabled the agents of the Dreaming Dark to move and act with absolute freedom throughout Khorvaire. Any direct conflict among Eberron's humanoid populations is a boon to this group, which wants to destabilize all of them. Many of the intense battles near the end of the war might have been avoided, if not for Dreaming Dark agents fanning the flames of fear and hate—often by invading the dreams of soldiers and rulers alike.

The feelings of mistrust and festering animosity between the nations that linger after the Treaty of Thronehold provide the Dreaming Dark with countless points of possible infection. Refugees, expatriates, and other displaced people provide the perfect vehicle for the Dreaming Dark to spread its influence across Khorvaire, carrying its corruption into new populations.

> ##### The Role of Dreams
>If you plan to use the Dreaming Dark as a major villain in your campaign, it can be helpful to establish the role of dreams early on. If dreams feel like a regular part of the story, it will be less obvious when the Dreaming Dark starts manipulating the characters' dreams. For example, you might establish a pattern of picking one adventurer and discussing their dreams each time the group takes a long rest. Consider these ideas for the basic seed of a dream:
>
>**Revisit recent events**. This can be a useful opportunity to call attention to a detail the characters overlooked. Clearly, this character's subconscious registered the detail as important!
>
>**Involve a current villain.** This can help build the players' hatred for an elusive recurring villain!
>
>**Foreshadow the future**. This could simply reflect a character's fears, but it might also convey a warning from a celestial or other supernatural creature.
>
>**Explore the character's past.** Give the player an opportunity to add depth to one element of the character's story.
>
>**Reflect anxiety**. An anxious character might dream about showing up in a dungeon with no armor or at school with no clothes. Narratively, these dreams can provide a moment of comic relief or heighten the players own concern about what's happening in the game.
>

### The Role of Dreams
All dreams occur in the plane of Dal Quor. When mortals sleep, their minds touch the plane and shape a shard of it. Normally, a dream is shaped by the memories and emotions of the dreamer. But the *dream* spell and similar effects (such as a night hag's Nightmare Haunting) can influence a dream from the outside, to a specific and often sinister purpose. The quori are masters of using the *dream* spell as a weapon to terrorize their foes.

It's possible for an entire adventure to take place in a dream. The trick with a dream adventure is ensuring that it feels meaningful, even consequential, and not just a waste of time. One of four basic approaches can help you do that:

- A real monster inhabits a character's dreams and poses a real threat to that character's mind or body. The goal of the adventure is to defeat that monster.
- A dreaming character is incapable of waking communication—they might be comatose or possessed. The goal of the adventure is to communicate with the dreamer and free them from whatever is preventing them from communicating.
- A villain has implanted some kind of psychic lock in a character's mind, which prevents them from accessing some knowledge or capability. The goal of the adventure is to remove the psychic lock, which might take the form of a complex trap or maze in the dream.
- The actual objective of the adventure lies in Dal Quor. The first goal is to find a way to break out of the mundane dreamscape and enter the wider plane.

The second challenge in crafting a dream adventure is how to bring all the characters in a party together in the same dream, which might or might not belong to one of them. Consider these possibilities:

- One of the characters is dreaming, and the others appear in the dream as memories and impressions in the dreamer's mind.
- Some exotic magic—a kalashtar ritual or an eldritch machine, perhaps—allows the characters to share a dream or to enter someone else's dream. This magic could also allow a character who ordinarily can't dream (such as an elf, a warforged, or a kalashtar) to enter the dreamscape as well.
- Agents of the Dreaming Dark use their magic to bring the dreams of the characters together so they can influence or target the whole party at once.

The Dream Adventures table puts these principles together and suggests hooks into this kind of adventure.

##### Dream Adventures
| d4 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Break a psychic lock that is preventing a House Thuranni spy from remembering what they learned about a sinister Dreaming Dark plot. |
| 2 | Escape into Dal Quor to find an artifact that can be brought back to the Material Plane when the characters awaken. |
| 3 | Rescue a character who is suffering from debilitating recurring nightmares by defeating the quori inhabiting the character's mind. |
| 4 | Stop the construction of an eldritch machine in Dal Quor that will give the quori physical access to the Material Plane again. |

#### Dying in Dreams
Death in dreams is less severe than in reality, but it's not without consequence. Of course, characters who are mere figments of a dreamer's imagination are simply removed from the dream. But a character dies while actually dreaming, the character receives no benefit from the rest and takes 3d6 psychic damage.

If you want to establish more severe consequences, you can. A dreamer killed by a quori could be trapped in Dal Quor while the quori possesses their body, forcing their allies to try to rescue them from their nightmares.

### Dreaming Dark NPCs
Agents of the Dreaming Dark are insidious villains that can appear anywhere, in almost any context. They receive orders from a cabal of powerful quori. The leader of the organization, known as the Devourer of Dreams, communes with the nightmare spirit of Dal Quor itself. The Dark's chief agent in Eberron is a **kalaraq quori** (see *chapter 6*) named Tirashana, who has planted mind seeds—mental copies of herself—across Khorvaire.

The Dreaming Dark has Inspired agents and **kalaraq quori** mind seeds (see *chapter 6*) scattered across Khorvaire, hidden within the membership of dragonmarked houses, noble families, and other driving forces. Because Dreaming Dark agents can communicate and coordinate with one another in dreams, they never have to risk losing their cover to receive assignments or transmit information.

##### Dreaming Dark NPCs
| d4 | NPC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A servant in a manor house overhears everything the visiting nobles whisper about in their private rooms. |
| 2 | The captain of a successful mercenary company suddenly changes the kinds of contracts they'll accept. |
| 3 | A local druid searches out monsters in the wilderness and drives them into murderous rampages. |
| 4 | A charismatic Cyran stirs up anger and discontent among the frightened refugees. |

### Dreaming Dark Campaign Themes
Long ago, the Dreaming Dark caused a long period of strife on the continent of Sarlona, fostering suspicion, rebellion, fear, prejudice, and greed among and within the various nations that held power at the time. While chaos reigned, the quori also carefully nurtured the human bloodlines that would become the Inspired, perfectly suited to serve as hosts for quori spirits. Then, when the destruction of the old kingdoms was complete, a group of bold champions—Inspired vessels of the Dreaming Dark—formed a new nation from the ashes of the old. Having conquered Sarlona by means of such manipulation, the Dreaming Dark has turned its sights to Khorvaire—which is already a continent in turmoil.

With the conquest of the entire continent in mind, the Dreaming Dark has three objectives in Khorvaire. The first is to cause chaos and strife whenever possible, turning allies against one another and spreading fear. The second is to promote their chosen champions. A champion could be a nation, a mercenary company, a dragonmarked house, or a religion—whatever it is, it will have been thoroughly subverted by the Dreaming Dark. Finally, the Dreaming Dark relentlessly pursues the kalashtar and takes every opportunity to bring down these enemies. The kalashtar are descended from rebel quori that defied the Dreaming Dark and want to push Dal Quor into an age of light.

Given those objectives, the Dreaming Dark can drive events on a small scale, by setting bandits in motion or triggering local feuds, or the adventurers might uncover evidence of plans that could reignite the Last War or bring an entire nation or religion under the sway of the Dreaming Dark.

### Dreaming Dark Adventure Hooks
The Dreaming Dark Adventure Hooks table offers some ideas for strange occurrences and nightmarish events that can touch off stories involving the Dreaming Dark.

##### Dreaming Dark Adventure Hooks
| d4 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The high priest of a temple falls into a deep sleep from which nothing can awaken them. |
| 2 | The characters notice a pattern after defeating several foes: each enemy exhibited a particular quirk of speech or gesture. They now recognize that quirk in an ally or mentor. |
| 3 | A mad wizard encoded the remedy to a destructive spell in their own dreams. The characters must enter the dreamscape and recover the remedy. |
| 4 | A war criminal imprisoned during the Last War reaches out, claiming to have evidence of their innocence and warning that a destructive force is influencing the government. |

## Droaam
Once, Droaam was a wild frontier that marked the edge of civilized Khorvaire. Today, it is home to one of the strangest nations on the continent. In the streets of the Great Crag, ogres and minotaurs rub shoulders with gnolls and goblins. Gargoyles and wyverns circle in the sky, while harpies call work crews to the quarries with their songs. Under the rule of the enigmatic Daughters of Sora Kell, this land grows stronger with each passing year.

>> ##### The Voice of Breland—Boranel Cedes Western Reaches
>>In a shocking move, King Boranel has ordered that all Brelish citizens who live west of the Graywall Mountains must leave their homes and return to the eastern lands, or else forfeit their claim to the king's protection. In the face of a few withered hags and a ragtag "army" of filthy ogres and mangy gnolls, King Boranel's legendary courage has apparently faltered. We can only assume he means to yield to Cyre next.
>>

Thanks to the guidance of the hags, the diverse inhabitants of Droaam are learning to work together and finding ways to use their supernatural gifts to help build and sustain society. A medusa might use its petrifying gaze to preserve the life of an injured ally until medical attention can be obtained. Harpies in the taverns of Droaam use their hypnotic songs to entertain rather than to harm. When you bring creatures from Droaam into the campaign, consider how different monsters can work together in unusual ways and how their special abilities could be used outside combat.

Droaam offers a way to introduce monsters into any adventure, and for characters to encounter these monsters in untraditional ways. Droaam demonstrates that even monstrous creatures want the same things that members of other races do, more or less.

Droaamish monsters of a civilized bent could appear anywhere in Khorvaire. House Tharashk brokers the services of Droaamish monsters across the continent. Some of these monsters can appear in traditionally aggressive roles, as mercenary soldiers, a crime lord's bodyguards, or assassins in the shadows of Sharn. But Tharashk also provides less violent services. Ogre laborers put their strength to practical use in many of the continent's cities. Gargoyle couriers are in high demand. Though monstrous workers of these sorts are still rare in many nations, their numbers are growing.

Conversely, a visit to Droaam gives adventurers a chance to explore a land untethered by the laws of the treaty nations, a realm where they are the outsiders and the monsters are at home. Adventurers might have to pursue a fugitive or a war criminal into Droaam, or go there in search of unusual services or information found only in the land of monsters.

### Warlords of Droaam
Droaam is home to a vast array of creatures. Many of these races maintain isolated enclaves: the medusa city of Cazhaak Draal, the harpy flights of the Byeshk Mountains, the scattered minotaur clans, the mysterious changeling city known as Lost. But other creatures have long been commingled. The ogres, orcs, trolls, hill giants, goblins, and kobolds of Droaam have never had distinct cultures; they have always been blended. Although enclaves made up of a single kind of creature do exist, most communities contain a mix of creatures.

In bygone days, many of these groups of creatures lived in transient communities, ruled by the most powerful among them and constantly in conflict with neighboring forces. When the Daughters of Sora Kell rose to power, they used force and persuasion to bring an end to this violence. They recognized the most powerful existing warlords as rulers of their domains, and they appointed lieutenants—including oni and other powerful and intelligent creatures—to govern other regions.

Within Droaam, any creature that commands the loyalty of a band and has successfully claimed and held territory can call itself a warlord, but only a small number of such leaders wield significant power. A few of the most notable warlords and factions are described below.

**Cairngorm**. A remarkably intelligent gargoyle, Cairngorm is the lord of Grimstone Keep. He leads the largest host of gargoyles in Droaam, and Grimstone is also home to orcs and other creatures.

**The Dark Pack**. An alliance of lycanthropes, worgs, and other bestial creatures is led by an elf werewolf named Zaeurl. The Dark Pack bears a deep hatred for followers of the Silver Flame.

**Gorodan Ashlord**. A fire giant exiled from Xen'drik has earned the loyalty of a powerful force of ogres and hill giants. Gorodan knows a great deal about Xen'drik and could prove a valuable resource to adventurers.

**Harpy Flights**. The harpies have long dwelled in the Byeshk Mountains. Several flights across the nation—including the Stormsinger, Last Dirge, and Rotwing—have pledged themselves to the Daughters of Sora Kell. Other flights remain in isolation in the mountains. The largest of these is the Wind Howlers, whose leader, Callain of the Bloody Word, despises the hags.

**Kethelrax the Cunning**. The kobold lord Kethelrax has laid claim to Shaarat Kol in the south of Droaam and leads host of kobolds and goblins—creatures that have been traditionally enslaved and oppressed by the larger and more powerful inhabitants of the region. Though his epithet, "the Cunning," is used mockingly by other warlords, Kethelrax has the favor of Sora Katra and has proven to be clever in his own right. The kobolds are thrilled to have their own territory and are fiercely loyal to the Daughters, but many yearn for revenge against their former masters.

**Rhesh Turakbar**. The minotaur warlord Rhesh Turakbar has united the small clans of his people into a deadly force. His fortress is on the eastern edge of Droaam, and he often leads raiding parties into Breland in the name of his fiendish patron, the Horned Prince—also known as **Rak Tulkhesh** (see *chapter 6*).

**Sheshka, the Queen of Stone.** The medusas have long held the ancient citadel of Cazhaak Draal. Though they are not numerous, their deadly gaze and trained basilisk pets make the medusas a force to be reckoned with. Medusa priests of the Dark Six are spiritual leaders in many Droaamish communities. Queen Sheshka is a skilled warrior and general. She has been loyal to the Daughters, but she is devoted to her people and will always do what's best for them.

**Tzaryan Rrac**. A cunning oni with a large force of ogres and orcs at his disposal, Tzaryan Rrac was quick to embrace the arrival of the hags, but he also yearns for greater power. Rrac is a skilled alchemist and a scholar of arcane lore.

**Venom Lords**. A group of tieflings called the Venom Lords leads a community of warlocks, some of whom are also tieflings. Their domain, called the Venomous Demesne, is hidden away in the desolate marshes south of Blackwater Lake, shrouded by powerful magic. Warlord Bal Molesh is a strong ally of the Daughters, and some of his tiefling kin can be found in the service of Daask.

**Xor'chylic**. A mind flayer serves as the governor of Graywall. It's said that the Daughters found Xor'chylic in Khyber, and received his loyalty in exchange for a pledge that the hags would give him an opportunity for vengeance against one of the daelkyr.

**Znir Pact**. The gnolls of Droaam, once servants of **Rak Tulkhesh**, broke ties with the demons long ago and swore an oath of loyalty to the pack above all else. Since standing together and being bound by this Znir Pact, the gnolls have never been subjugated by any other force, and have never sought to conquer. Instead, they sell their services as hunters and soldiers, serving all warlords. The gnolls are trusted across Droaam.

### Ruined Dhakaani Fort
Ruined forts of ancient Dhakaani design are common in Droaam, and in many cases the structures have been remodeled into homes or refitted for defense. They also make ideal lairs for less intelligent monsters, places where they can bring their next meals along with anything those poor souls happened to be carrying.

#### Ruined Dhakaani Fort Features
Map 4.3 shows an ancient Dhakaani fort built into a cliff face. It consists of four tiers in varying states of ruin.

The cellar, including a cistern and storage areas, is accessed by way of secret trap doors in the floor above.

The ground floor features a statue of a great hobgoblin hero of old in a large enclosed courtyard, and a cluster of unidentifiable statues in one back corner. The outermost area of the ground floor is the most severely damaged part of the fort.

The middle tower consists of two crumbling floors with arrow slits, accessed by spiral staircases from the ground level. The upper level of the tower has been severely damaged, with only old wooden planks and a rickety ladder allowing movement between the two floors.

The top level of the fort overhangs the tower. Large portions of the floor are missing, making certain areas difficult to reach. Arrow slits on the perimeter of this level made it instrumental to the fort's defense, and the large rooms here were used for arms storage and mustering troops for battle.

#### Ruined Dhakaani Fort Adventures
The Ruined Fort Adventures table offers some ideas for drawing a party to the location.

##### Ruined Fort Adventures
| d6 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Gnolls** lairing in the fort have been attacking caravans and travelers near the Darguun border. But the gnolls are mercenaries. Who are they working for? |
| 2 | The ruins are said to hold a powerful magic item that was used by the ancient Dhakaani goblins against the daelkyr. |
| 3 | The party is hired to recruit several **hill giants** for a building project in western Breland. Step one is making sure the giants lairing in the fort don't kill the party; step two is persuading them to work for humans. |
| 4 | The characters must rescue prisoners being held by the monsters in the ruins. |
| 5 | A group of Brelish humans determined to "take Brelish lands back from the monsters" have settled and started rebuilding the ruined fort. The party is asked to help them defend the fort—or to protect them as they flee back to Breland, pursued by angry Droaamites. |
| 6 | A Brelish noble hires the party to retrieve a family heirloom lost in the fort's ruins. |

### Daughters of Sora Kell
Sora Kell is an ancient night hag with exceptional powers. She is said to have dealt with dragons and demons in the first age of the world, and to have tricked the Sovereigns themselves. Even though she is immortal, there have been no new legends of her deeds since the advent of Galifar, but that's when her daughters rose to infamy. All three of the Daughters of Sora Kell possess powers far beyond what's usual for their kind. They are creatures of legend, beings who have defeated many of the greatest heroes of Galifar.

Sora Katra is the voice of the Daughters. Charismatic and clever, she is an accomplished illusionist and shapeshifter who rarely wears the same face twice. Stories say that she weaves curses on her loom, and that she loves to match wits with heroes and champions. She speaks for Droaam, and is always interested in intrigues and plots.

Sora Maenya is the commander of Droaam's armies. It's said that she can crush a giant with her bare hands, then eat the whole thing and still be hungry. She binds the souls of her victims to their skulls, which she keeps in her lair. Though many stories depict her as merely a brute, she is a clever strategist and a master of intimidation and terror.

Sora Teraza is a mystery. Though blind, or perhaps because of her blindness, she possesses vast powers of divination. She is the most gifted oracle of the age, but her answers are often cryptic, even when dealing with her sisters; she might give vital advice even to her enemies. There is little that can be hidden from Sora Teraza, but the question is always whether she'll share what she knows.

#### The Daughters and the War
Droaam emerged as a nation in the final decade of the Last War. King Boranel of Breland brokered an uneasy truce with Droaam, but the other nations of Khorvaire have refused to recognize the Daughters' sovereignty. Most leaders believe Droaam will soon collapse into chaos, or that Breland will gather its strength and crush the Daughters. Others think that either of those assumptions gravely underestimates the abilities of the Daughters and their subjects.

In the aftermath of the war, the fighting forces of Droaam have become a significant resource for other nations of Khorvaire. Gnolls, minotaurs, ogres, and other creatures have proven to be capable mercenaries and laborers, and the Daughters have worked with House Tharashk to make these resources available to the rest of Khorvaire. This exchange both puts gold into the Daughters' coffers, and spreads their eyes and ears throughout the wider world.

#### The Daughters Campaign Themes
When involving the Daughters of Sora Kell in your campaign, the first question you need to answer is: what are their goals for Droaam?

One possibility is that the Daughters believe in their nation—that it is important to them to unite the monsters of Droaam and to give their charges a voice in the world. In this case, the Daughters can be ultimately sympathetic figures. They are fighting against the fears and prejudices of the people of the Five Nations, and also the selfish ambitions of many of their own power-hungry warlords. Once the adventurers learn that the Daughters truly want peace and prosperity, they could become envoys of the Daughters in the Five Nations or help to fight their enemies in Droaam. A character of a monstrous race could even become a warlord of Droaam. Even if the adventurers don't work directly with the Daughters, they could have need of their assistance; Sora Teraza might hold the answer to a vital mystery, or the adventurers might need an artifact hidden in the vaults of the Great Crag.

If you'd rather use the Daughters as straightforward villains, they could be driven by a thirst for power or a desire to end humanity's dominance over Khorvaire. Sora Teraza's visions enable them to target enemies with unerring precision and reveal enemy plans before they are carried out. Can the adventurers find a way to deal with Sora Teraza and end this threat before the armies of Droaam and agents of Daask make their move?

A middle-of-the-road view is that the Daughters are motivated solely by Sora Teraza's visions. They have no interest in gaining power or in maintaining their kingdom; they are fulfilling their role in a story that is still unfolding, and once it's resolved, they will abandon their thrones and return to their hidden haunts. Can Droaam survive without the Daughters, or will the nation dissolve into chaos?

Whatever path you choose should also be reflected in the nature of the criminal organization Daask, described later in this chapter. Those monsters are agents of Sora Katra; how do their actions support her agenda? Are they seizing power on behalf of Droaam, or are they pursuing a more mysterious agenda?

As described in *chapter 1*, Sora Kell herself could be a group patron for a party of adventurers. In this case, the characters' relationship with the sisters is complicated. Do the Daughters consider the adventurers to be allies, or are they bitter rivals? Does Sora Kell support the nation of Droaam, or are the Daughters defying the wishes of their mother?

### Droaam Adventure Hooks
Any adventure that takes place in Droaam or involves creatures that hail from that nation gives the players and their characters a chance to deal with monsters that don't always behave monstrously. The Droaam Adventure Hooks table presents a variety of story links involving Droaam, the Daughters of Sora Kell, or both.

##### Droaam Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A **medusa** sends authorities a broken stone finger bearing a distinctive signet ring, and invites emissaries to bring gold, a magic item, or some other ransom for the petrified individual's release. |
| 2 | A House Lyrandar airship has gone down just beyond the Graywall Mountains. The characters must move immediately to rescue any survivors and secure a secret message the ship was carrying. |
| 3 | Sora Teraza appears in a character's dreams every few nights, urging the character to explore a particular ruin. |
| 4 | The characters must entreat the Daughters of Sora Kell for knowledge of how to remove a seemingly unbreakable curse. |
| 5 | The characters must purchase or steal a daelkyr tome or artifact from the tower of Mordain the Fleshweaver, a powerful wizard banished from the Twelve who now makes his home in western Droaam. |
| 6 | An **ogre** warlord is accused of destroying a village just outside the borders of Droaam. The characters must bring the warlord to justice or work with the ogre to find the real culprit. |

## Gatekeepers
The Gatekeepers are a druidic sect dedicated to protecting the natural world from unnatural forces. They battle aberrations and guard against extraplanar invasions and the release of ancient evils.

The Gatekeepers maintain the oldest druidic tradition on Khorvaire. Over fifteen thousand years ago, the green dragon Vvaraak came to the Shadow Marches and gathered a following from among the orcs of the region. In her studies of the Prophecy, Vvaraak had foreseen a great threat that could be stopped only by the younger races. So she taught the orcs the secret language of the natural world and showed them how to work with stone and soil, and how to read the future in the movement of the Ring of Siberys. She charged her students to remain ever vigilant against the threat that was to come, and to protect nature from those that would corrupt it.

Thousands of years later, the daelkyr (see *chapter 6*) opened gates from the plane of Xoriat and unleashed hordes of mind flayers, beholders, and other foul creatures into the world. The conflict that followed destroyed the goblin empire of Dhakaan, and the daelkyr's invasion left scars across Khorvaire. Ultimately, Vvaraak's students sealed the gates and imprisoned the daelkyr in Khyber. Even after this triumph, the orcs couldn't be sure if they had turned back the threat Vvaraak had foreseen, or if a greater danger lay ahead. So, in addition to guarding the seals that bind the daelkyr and keep Xoriat at bay, the Gatekeepers remained vigilant against the possibility of worse to come.

In the millennia since that struggle ended, the Gatekeepers have shared Vvaraak's wisdom and druidic magic with humans, shifters, and others who came to Khorvaire. New interpretations of Vvaraak's teachings gave birth to new druid sects: the Wardens of the Wood, the Greensingers, and the Ashbound. Today, the Gatekeepers are one of the smaller sects, and many of the sites of their long-ago battles have been abandoned and forgotten. But some Gatekeepers still remain in the Shadow Marches and the Eldeen Reaches, continuing their vigil to this day.

### The Gatekeepers in the War
The Last War had only minimal impact on the Gatekeepers, and vice versa. The druids' primary concern was to prevent military activity from disrupting the seals they guarded. Occasionally the Gatekeepers attacked groups of scouts or military patrols, driving them away to ensure that battles didn't erupt in their vicinity. Sometimes the Gatekeepers failed in those efforts, and Xoriat's corruption spread over some remote regions while the war raged around them.

### Gatekeeper Seal
The seals forged by the Gatekeepers have a variety of purposes and forms. Some are tied to specific daelkyr, keeping those individuals bound in Khyber and stripping them of some of their powers. Others ward against aberrations in general, or suppress the influence of the plane of Xoriat. Some seals are amulets, objects that can be carried and stolen. It's said that one of the seals is a druidic bloodline, and it will last until the last member of the line is slain.

The most common form of Gatekeeper seal is a great stone slab set into the ground or a cavern wall. It is carved with mystical symbols that hedge out the influence of Xoriat and maintain the barrier. The map depicts one such seal, along with the druidic trappings and dwellings surrounding it.

#### Gatekeeper Seal Features
Map 4.4 shows what a Gatekeeper seal might look like. A seal is a protected site, usually attended at all times by Gatekeepers who live at or near the seal. The one depicted in the map lies on the edge of a swamp, but it could be located in any kind of terrain. A circle of standing stones serves to focus the magic of the area toward the seal itself, and the stones also serve as a place of worship for the druids' devotions and ceremonies.

![[113-map44_gatekeeperseal-player.jpg|right|300]]((Player Version))
#### Gatekeeper Seal Adventures
The location of a Gatekeeper seal might be the site of an adventure's climax, or the characters might need to find one in order to consult with the guardians there. The Gatekeeper Seal Adventures table presents some possibilities.

##### Gatekeeper Seal Adventures
| d4 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Deliver a specially treated Khyber dragonshard to the Gatekeepers to repair a widening crack in the seal. |
| 2 | Petition the keepers of a seal for information on an aberration that has been terrorizing the countryside. |
| 3 | Assist the Gatekeepers in an annual ritual that will reenergize the seal and keep it shut for another year. |
| 4 | Escort a new Gatekeeper guardian safely to the seal after its previous guardians were corrupted. |

### Gatekeeper NPCs
Gatekeepers are sworn to protect the world, and thus are more likely to be encountered as allies than as enemies. It's always possible, though, for even noble Gatekeepers to fall prey to madness and corruption, thus becoming the very evils they are sworn to fight.

##### Gatekeeper NPCs
| d4 | NPC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The spirit of a long-dead Gatekeeper lives on in the body of an ancient toad. It speaks in a deep, croaking voice. |
| 2 | A half-orc Gatekeeper works in House Tharashk as an investigator, searching for signs of planar disturbances. |
| 3 | A human Gatekeeper is on a pilgrimage, carrying an amulet that serves as a seal on a journey to a number of sacred sites to restore its power. |
| 4 | An old orc ranger is murdering people in Sharn, claiming that they've been corrupted by the daelkyr. |

### Gatekeeper Campaign Themes
The Gatekeepers are the remnants of an ancient order. Once they saved the world. Now they are all but forgotten, and the world needs saving again. The surviving Gatekeepers might not have the strength to win the fight alone, and that's where adventurers come in. Gatekeepers can serve as patrons or advisors, providing crucial information or setting the adventurers on the proper path. They can also come to the rescue of adventurers who are close to being overwhelmed by mind flayers or dolgaunts.

At certain points in a campaign, the Gatekeepers might seem to be villains. The druids' mission to protect their seals and to oppose the rise of aberrations is of the utmost importance. Anyone who threatens a seal or assists the machinations of the daelkyr, no matter how unwittingly, risks making relentless enemies in the Gatekeepers. A simple shift in circumstances, such as the death of a noble that causes ownership of a trackless parcel of land to change hands, could bring the characters into sudden conflict with the Gatekeepers.

### Gatekeeper Adventure Hooks
Gatekeepers can be at the center of any number of potential stories. The Gatekeeper Adventure Hooks table offers some options.

##### Gatekeeper Adventure Hooks
| d8 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | While pursuing rumors of lycanthrope activity, the characters discover a good-aligned werebear that is working with the Gatekeepers to stop an incursion from Khyber. |
| 2 | A Gatekeeper seal in the form of a stone tablet falls into the characters' hands. They must return the seal to the Gatekeepers before its magic fades. |
| 3 | A logging operation is moving close to the area protected by a seal, and the party must convince the loggers to relocate before their work touches off a conflict with the Gatekeepers. |
| 4 | Working with an agent of the Chamber, the Gatekeepers are convinced the actions of the characters will bring a daelkyr one step closer to freedom. |
| 5 | The characters discover evidence suggesting that the rituals performed by the local Gatekeepers are weakening their seal, not empowering it. |
| 6 | Pilgrims traveling through a forest draw the attention of Gatekeepers, who think they are spies sent to sabotage the nearby seal. |
| 7 | One of the kidnapped victims who was rescued from a marauding band of aberrations turns out to be a Gatekeeper initiate. |
| 8 | The adventurers are sent to the Mror Holds to investigate the activity of **Dyrrn** the Corruptor and uncover a daelkyr cult among the dwarves. |

## Goblinoids (Heirs of Dhakaan)
War drums are sounding in the depths beneath Darguun. Bugbear champions hone their adamantine greatswords, and hobgoblin dirge singers call the legions to battle. The warriors of Dhakaan are preparing to reclaim their stolen lands, and the nations of Khorvaire have no idea what's coming.

During the struggle with the daelkyr, some Dhakaani leaders saw the madness spreading among their people and knew it would destroy their civilization. They led their forces into deep subterranean chambers and severed all contact with the outside world. In recent years these ancient clans—who call themselves the Kech Dhakaan ("bearers of [the traditions of] Dhakaan")—have finally returned to the surface.

The Dhakaani are utterly devoted to war, matched only by the Valenar elves in their devotion to the martial arts. Their weaponsmiths and armorers know techniques that even the artificers of House Cannith cannot duplicate. Throughout the Last War, no nation faced any other force that had the skill and resources of the resurgent Dhakaani.

But there is one obstacle to their rise: the Heirs of Dhakaan have no emperor. The goblinoids are divided into clans, and each clan, or *kech*, believes its leader has the right to control all the others. And so the champions of Dhakaan continuously compete with each other to prove their right to rule. The Kech Sharaat (Bladebearers) believe that leadership is best achieved through force of arms. The Kech Volaar (Wordbearers) believe that knowledge is the greater weapon, and they seek to recover artifacts and weapons that were lost when the empire fell. These and several less influential clans are competing for overall leadership, while the spies and assassins of the Khesh'dar (Silent Folk) remain neutral in the struggle, gathering information on the modern world and serving every clan.

At the moment, the Heirs of Dhakaan are maintaining a low profile. They fight most of their battles underground, and occasionally dispatch small squads to carry out missions on the surface. Humans usually don't know enough about goblins to tell the difference between the Dhakaani and the people of Darguun. The truth of the matter is gradually spreading within Darguun, but no one yet realizes the power of the force that lies beneath their nation.

### The Heirs and the War
The Last War caused the Heirs of Dhakaan to finally stir and emerge from their deep vaults. They recognize that humanity has been weakened by its self-inflicted wounds. The rise of Darguun and the proliferation of that nation's Ghaal'dar mercenaries enables the Dhakaani to move around Khorvaire without drawing undue attention. And the Mourning, ultimately, demonstrated that the races of the Five Nations could not be trusted with ruling Khorvaire. It was time for the Dhakaani to return and subjugate the other races to their firm hand once again.

The Heirs of Dhakaan are devoted to war, with an unmatched focus on sheer martial skill. Their weaponry and artillery are of the highest quality, and they place their trust in strength of arms, not on magic. The Dhakaani don't worship gods, and no clerics or paladins are among them. The Kech Volaar have picked up some of the elven traditions of wizardry, and all clans have bards known as *duur'kala* (dirge singers), but in general the Dhakaani don't rely on magic on the battlefield.

### Dhakaani Fort
All across Darguun, the Heirs of Dhakaan are reclaiming surviving remnants of their fallen empire, and they even cautiously range out into surrounding nations. You can use Map 4.3: Ruined Dhakaani Fort as the basis for a fort that has been reclaimed by the Heirs, which would be in better repair and guarded by competent troops.

#### Dhakaani Fort Adventures
The Dhakaani Fort Adventures table describes some tasks that could bring characters to such a place.

##### Dhakaani Fort Adventures
| d10 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Steal an ancient magic weapon from the fort's commander. |
| 2 | Bring a treaty proposal to the fort, in hopes of having it conveyed to the leader of the occupying kech. |
| 3 | Gather intelligence about the force occupying the fort in preparation for a raid. |
| 4 | Rescue prospectors who were taken prisoner and held in the fort's dungeons. |
| 5 | Steal the fort commander's notes on troop movements in the surrounding areas. |
| 6 | Lead a strike force against the fort to drive out or destroy the occupying Dhakaani. |
| 7 | Rush to support a small squad besieging the fort before Dhakaani reinforcements arrive and break the siege. |
| 8 | Assassinate or kidnap the advisor to the fort's commander. |
| 9 | Work with the occupying commander to discover the spy from another kech in their ranks. |
| 10 | Break a siege by Darguun goblinoids that has trapped the characters' Dhakaani allies within the fort. |

### Goblinoid NPCs
Characters who approach the Heirs of Dhakaan expecting a ragtag band of goblinoids are in for a rude awakening. The Heirs of Dhakaan are well equipped and fight with precision and efficiency, coordinating their efforts to eliminate spellcasters and other obvious threats.

Dhakaani squads are utterly devoted to their kech leaders and their empire. All are bound by the principles of *muut* and *atcha* (honor and duty), but they believe that humans and their kin don't deserve to be treated with honor. All the goblinoid races work together among the Dhakaani, and all are convinced of the superiority of their culture. When forced to fight other Dhakaani, they will usually spare the lives of their opponents, but against all other adversaries—including other goblinoids—they are ruthless.

##### Goblinoid NPCs
| d8 | NPC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A hobgoblin bard of the Kech Volaar leads an elite team of dungeon delvers to recover Dhakaani artifacts from ancient ruins. |
| 2 | A remarkably intelligent goblin studying at Arcanix or Morgrave is actually a Khesh'dar spy identifying tomes of arcane knowledge worth stealing. |
| 3 | A Dhakaani strike force assaults a museum or a noble's private holdings, reclaiming goblin artifacts "pillaged" from ruins. These relics could be part of an eldritch machine, or could simply have important ceremonial value. |
| 4 | A goblin spy stirs up trouble among the city goblins in a major city, using tales of their former glory to incite them to violence. |
| 5 | A string of mysterious bombings are actually the work of Dhakaani sappers testing the strength of modern fortifications. |
| 6 | A Dhakaani strike force attacks a Deneith outpost built atop a goblin ruin. Are the goblins just angry about the desecration, or is something hidden beneath the outpost? |
| 7 | A bugbear of the Kech Sharaat, to test the mettle of the adventurers, engages them in a series of guerrilla attacks as they are traveling through the wilderness. |
| 8 | A hobgoblin warlock seeks to harness the power of the daelkyr or the fiendish overlords to win the imperial crown for her kech. |

### Goblinoid Campaign Themes
The Heirs of Dhakaan are a substantial military threat. The goblins can clash with adventurers while they are exploring ancient ruins, or they can launch strikes against outposts or vaults the adventurers are guarding. Whatever the Dhakaani do, it should be part of a mission objective. Is the goal to strengthen their kech? Gather information about the enemy? Recover Dhakaani relics?

Initially the Dhakaani should be mysterious: remarkably skilled goblins that fight to the death or disappear into the shadows. The characters might logically assume that they are Darguul mercenaries. Over time, the adventurers should learn more about them and realize that they are the advance force of a great army.

The Heirs of Dhakaan can remain an enigmatic foe, encountered only when they attack. But a group of adventurers could come to earn the respect of their Dhakaani foes and learn more about the enemy. Perhaps a group of adventurers chooses to respect the Dhakaani's claim to an artifact, surrendering it willingly. If they do so, they could find out more about the goblins and the struggle for leadership among the clans. Of all the goblins, the Kech Volaar are the most interested in understanding the people of Khorvaire; if there's any chance to negotiate a peace with Dhakaan, it would be with this clan.

As far as the goblins are concerned, humans stole their lands, pillaged their tombs, and enslaved their descendants. The Dhakaani aren't evil, but they believe humanity to be brutal and cruel, people without *muut* or *atcha*. Faced with an adventurer wielding a magic sword taken from a Dhakaani ruin, the Heirs of Dhakaan are rightfully angry and violent in their response to this tomb robber.

### Heirs of Dhakaan Adventure Hooks
The Heirs of Dhakaan Adventure Hooks table offers some options for kicking off stories that involve the Dhakaani.

##### Heirs of Dhakaan Adventure Hooks
| d12 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A scout patrol has gone missing near the border of Darguun. |
| 2 | A mining tunnel has collapsed, revealing a network of caverns leading into Khyber. The Heirs of Dhakaan are waiting in the darkness and decide to strike first. |
| 3 | A squad of goblins attempts to steal back spoils of a recent adventure, cursing the characters for being grave robbers. |
| 4 | A lone hobgoblin warrior stands at the gates of a town, intent on dueling the mercenary captain who slew their brother. The warrior has already killed ten soldiers that tried to remove them. |
| 5 | Race against a Dhakaani force to recover an ancient artifact from a ruin. |
| 6 | Defend a series of temples against Dhakaani raiders targeting these "houses of false gods." |
| 7 | Explorers discover a fragment of an ancient Dhakaani song that seems to tell of the true heir of Dhakaan. The complete lyrics might settle the question of succession. |
| 8 | The Dhakaani begin kidnapping warforged so that their artificers can learn how to make their own construct soldiers. |
| 9 | In a sacked human settlement, a battle between two opposing forces of goblinoids breaks out. Which side was the cause of the destruction? |
| 10 | The Kech Sharaat send emissaries to a nearby city with a simple message: abandon the town within one week, or die. |
| 11 | Goblin scouts have been spotted far from Darguun, moving with uncharacteristic coordination and precision. |
| 12 | A representative of the Kech Volaar approaches the characters to request their help in confronting their rivals to maintain the balance of power among the Dhakaani. |

# Chapter 4: Building Eberron Adventures
![[114-4-03.png|right|300]]

## The Last War
Khorvaire is still rising from the ashes of the Last War. The consequences of a century of conflict can't be offset with a single treaty. The Last War didn't end because people resolved their differences, and it didn't end with a victor. It ended when the Mourning destroyed Cyre, because people were afraid that the war itself was the cause of that cataclysm, and that continuing the struggle could doom them all. Many are sick of the endless conflict and embrace the peace. But just as many yearn to finish what their ancestors started, and others see potential profit for themselves in war. Some leaders focus on healing the lingering wounds of the conflict, while others work to ensure that their people will have an edge when fighting begins anew.

The Last War is one of the primary themes of Eberron. When developing an adventure in Khorvaire, consider how the lingering impact of the war could affect the story. Some element of the war could drive the entire adventure; the heroes could be tasked with recovering a relic lost in the war, or capturing a fugitive war criminal. But it can also be a background note that simply adds flavor to a story. If the adventure features a group of bandits, perhaps they're deserters, which can be all the more interesting if they once served in the army of the same nation as one of the player characters.

This section looks at the different ways that the Last War can influence an adventure.

### Personal Impact
As players develop characters in an Eberron campaign, you can work with them to determine the role that the war played in their background. Here are a few topics for conversation:

**Military Service**. Did the character fight in the war? If so, which nation did they serve and what role did they fill? If more than one of the characters fought in the war, did they serve together (or as allies) or fight on opposing sides? Military service can be the basis of a strong connection for two or more characters.

**Civilian Life**. If the character is from one of the Five Nations and didn't fight in the war, how and why did they remain on the sidelines? Did they oppose the war? Did they do something to avoid conscription, or was there a reason they were considered unsuitable for service?

**Personal Loss**. What did the characters lose during the war? Did members of their family die, and if so, how? Was the village they grew up in destroyed, and if so, who was responsible? If the characters are from Cyre, they have lost their nation. Do they have any loved ones left? Did they spend time in a refugee camp or in the outpost of New Cyre in Breland? Do they support Prince Oargev as the leader of Cyre, or do they have other ideas for the nation's future?

For example, when an Aundairan player character meets a group of Eldeen druids, it's an opportunity to exploit the bad blood between Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches and to determine if this interaction has any personal relevance to the character. If a player character has the soldier background, you can introduce an NPC as a former comrade and work out the details with the player on the spot. The Personal Impact table provides ideas for plot hooks that could directly involve a player character in a scenario.

##### Personal Impact
| d6 | Impact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A former comrade-in-arms asks a player character for help. |
| 2 | One of the adventurers is from a place destroyed during the war; refugees from that location ask for their help. |
| 3 | One of the characters served with the villain during the war, and the villain betrayed them or their nation. |
| 4 | The villain was the cruel commander of a camp where one of the characters was held as a prisoner of war. |
| 5 | One of the adventurers made a promise to a comrade during the war, and achieving the goal of the adventure will fulfill that promise. |
| 6 | The adventure revolves around something one of the characters saw during the war: a powerful weapon, an unusual battlefield, or a unique warforged. |

### Bitter Grievances
Alliances shifted during the war, and almost every nation has grievances with every other one. Some of these postwar feuds rage more fiercely than others. One of these sources of tension could play a role in a character's back story, the plot of an adventure, or the reactions of an NPC. Although the nations are afraid to return to all-out war, any of these feuds could escalate.

#### Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches
Forty years ago, the farmers of western Aundair joined with the druids of the Towering Woods in seceding from the kingdom and founding the Eldeen Reaches. Most Aundairians consider this an unforgivable act of treason committed at a time of national weakness. The Reachers say their actions were precipitated by the neglect and corruption of the Aundairian nobles. Now that the war is over, many Aundairians believe Queen Aurala should reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, whether through diplomacy or force.

#### Breland and Droaam
Monstrous raiders from the western wilderness have plagued Breland for centuries. A decade ago, the Daughters of Sora Kell united the scattered warlords of the region under the flag of Droaam. Furious clashes erupted between Breland and Droaam, centering on the fortress of Orcbone and Brelish settlers in the west. Breland led the opposition to recognizing Droaam as a nation under the Treaty of Thronehold, and some Brelish believe King Boranel should take dramatic action to end this threat.

#### Cyre and the World
Cyrans maintain that they alone were in the right during the Last War, which began when the other nations refused to acknowledge the Cyran queen's rightful claim to the throne of Galifar. Proud until the end, Cyre clashed with all the other nations. Now Cyre is destroyed, and Cyran refugees everywhere are dependent on the kindness of their former enemies. But many of those people believe that Cyre deserves no mercy, and that the refugees should be treated as enemy combatants rather than offered charity and compassion.

#### Karrnath and Thrane
The enmity between these two nations runs far deeper and longer than what was wrought by the Last War. Thrane is the bastion of the Church of the Silver Flame, while Karrnath resorted to necromancy in the course of the war. Thranes accuse Karrns of being morally bankrupt; Karrns say that the Thranes are arrogant and naive. This long-standing rivalry led to intense conflict in the early days of the war, and it only grew worse. When Thrane became a theocracy, Karrns seized on this act as proof that the nation had abandoned the traditions of Galifar. When Karrnath integrated undead into its armies, Thrane swore it would never be at peace with those who would use such foul magic. Both nations have accepted the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, and the Karrnathi king has forsworn the creation of new undead soldiers, but the treaty has done nothing to ease the enmity between the two.

#### Thaliost
The ancient city of Thaliost was once part of Aundair, and it has many proud ties to the history of that nation. It was seized by Thrane during the Last War, and the Treaty of Thronehold ratified its occupation of the place. Thrane placed an Aundairian archbishop, Solgar Dariznu, in charge of the city, and it has become a haven for Aundairian followers of the Silver Flame. But many of its citizens consider themselves to be Aundairians, and many prominent citizens of Aundair are putting great pressure on Queen Aurala to retake the city. The tension has been exacerbated by Archbishop Dariznu, who has taken brutal action to suppress Aundairian opposition to Thrane's occupation of the city.

#### Valenar
The elves of Valenar have broken the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold on several occasions. They regularly antagonize their neighbors, raiding and provoking everyone in reach of their war bands; some independent war bands have even crossed the Talenta Plains to raid across the borders of Karrnath and Q'barra. High King Vadallia insists that these are the actions of individual soldiers, but he refuses to take action against the perpetrators. Some scholars believe Vadallia and the Valenar are trying to provoke a full-scale conflict—by the strictures of their religion they don't want to be conquerors, but they want a powerful enemy to attack their nation. If this hypothesis is true, they might continue to escalate their activity until Karrnath or another powerful nation is forced to react.

Though the Valenar regularly raid their neighbors, these attacks rarely target civilians. The elves aren't interested in wealth or territory; they are looking for challenging battles. They might attack military outposts, patrols, adventurers, or other brigands—any force that seems like it could put up a good fight.

### Everyday Impact
There's no place in Khorvaire that escaped the Last War unscathed. Even villages that were never attacked lost their children to conscription or suffered from shortages. Some towns far from the front lines suffered damage from long-distance magic weapons or terror attacks. Any time you are setting a scene, you could add some element that speaks to the ongoing impact of the Last War. The Everyday Impact table offers some suggestions for these elements.

##### Everyday Impact
| d6 | Impact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A supply shortage is causing tension in the community. This shortage could be of a basic commodity (such as bread), a luxury item (such as wine), or an important service. |
| 2 | Demonstrators in the streets are protesting against refugees or warforged, urging a return to war, complaining about shortages or neglect, or drawing attention to the needs of veterans, refugees, or others. |
| 3 | A disabled veteran shares war stories while begging for copper. |
| 4 | A crowd has gathered around two people engaged in a heated discussion about the war. |
| 5 | A street vendor is selling unusual souvenirs from the war—pieces of a warforged titan, shards of an airship, and other curiosities. |
| 6 | A memorial has been raised to commemorate members of the community lost in the war. |

### The Cold War
No one knows what caused the Mourning, and the fear of repeating this cataclysm—not the Treaty of Thronehold—is what keeps potential combatants at bay. No one is happy with the outcome of the war, but no one dares to continue fighting, since all believe that renewed full-scale conflict could result in utter destruction. That said, the general belief is that the mystery of the Mourning will eventually be solved. Either someone will learn how to control the power that caused the Mournland, or the precise cause will be determined and people will be able to tell if it still poses a threat.

Many people truly hope that the Last War will live up to its name forever. But others prepare for more war even as they pursue peace. First and foremost, every nation wants to unravel the mystery of the Mourning; a nation that could learn how to use this power would be unstoppable. Other forces are searching for weapons or forgotten powers that could turn the tide if another war breaks out. Adventurers could find themselves racing through ruins in Xen'drik, trying to destroy a weapon of the ancient giants before the Emerald Claw can claim it for Karrnath and **Lady Illmarrow**.

The characters can stumble into a web of intrigue without seeing the sticky strands. Perhaps a patron hires the adventurers to transport what seems to be an ordinary backpack full of goods, and they don't realize that it has a secret magical compartment until enemy spies come looking for whatever is inside it. Or a dying spy presses an amulet into the hand of one of the adventurers, saying, "The fate of Breland depends on you getting this to Boranel. Don't trust anyone!" Assuming the adventurers care about the fate of Breland, they're pressed into an urgent adventure that has implications they might not see or understand.

### Playing During the Last War
In your campaign, you might want to take a look back at the war as it unfolds. Setting an adventure during the Last War puts the characters in a tumultuous time of political intrigue, tenuous alliances, and brutal conflicts. Consider these ways to make the Last War a present reality in your campaign:

- The players create new characters who live during a specific phase of the war. These characters could be figures of legend whose great deeds are known to the present-day characters, or they could be unknowns caught up in events much larger than themselves. In either case, the adventure they undertake can set the stage for events in the "present day" of your campaign.
- You might run an introductory session or flashback set during the waning years of the war, bringing the characters' backgrounds to life. Maybe the characters are all part of the same unit in the war, or they might be enemies forced to cooperate when disaster strikes. Are the characters participants in a memorable battle? Do they take actions they'll later regret? Do they make a bitter enemy who comes back to haunt them years later, when the campaign continues in the present day?
- A magical phenomenon might send the characters back in time, putting them in the middle of the conflict. Are they transported there to learn something? To alter the course of history? Or are they just stranded in a twisted time stream? How will they escape the horrors of the war and get back to their own time?

### Villains of the Last War
Just as adventurers are shaped by their experiences in the Last War, villains often carry the physical and mental scars of the conflict. When developing the details of a villain's background, consider the following options.

#### War Criminal
What horrific actions did the villain take during the Last War? Did they massacre civilians? Betray their comrades or their nation? A brilliant artificer might have designed arcane weapons that violated the rules of engagement. A Karrnathi **bone knight** (see *chapter 6*) could have overseen a camp where prisoners of war were used as subjects in necromantic experiments. Is the villain infamous for their crimes, or yet to be exposed for what they did? Do they believe that their crimes were justified? Is the criminal protected by powerful people in their nation, or reviled by the people they served?

#### Grim Inspiration
Something the villain saw or experienced during the war made a lasting impression that still drives them today. Perhaps their family was killed in a senseless attack, and everything they are doing is motivated by a desire to avenge this loss. Maybe they think that they were betrayed by their own nation. Perhaps they were caught in the Mourning, and even though they somehow survived it, what they lived through drove them insane.

#### Former Comrade
A former comrade-in-arms can be a useful hook to draw adventurers into a story—or a compelling villain. Which one of the characters served alongside the villain? Were they equals, or was one of higher rank? Did the villain abandon or betray the adventurer, or was it the adventurer who betrayed the villain? This option can be especially interesting for a warforged villain; while searching for their own identity following the war, they have embraced a dark path. If you use this motif, it's important to develop the story in conjunction with the players whose characters are connected to the villain—either establishing crucial details ahead of time, or developing them together by way of a flashback.

#### War-Torn Survivor
At first meeting, the villain of an adventure might seem to be a person of honor, or at the least a hardscrabble survivor doing what they think is right after surviving the war. The villain might have experienced some of the same things in the war that the characters did, making it easy for the characters to understand the villain's point of view—or at least to harbor a sliver of doubt that makes them think twice before rushing to condemn the villain. The War-Torn Villains table suggests twists you can add to villains mentioned elsewhere in this chapter to give them and their schemes a tie to the Last War.

##### War-Torn Villains
| d6 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The villain doesn't know (or refuses to believe) that the war has ended. |
| 2 | The villain experienced horrors during the war and targets the people they believe to be responsible. |
| 3 | The villain is using the skills they learned during the war to target war profiteers or national leaders. |
| 4 | The villain is a former military commander who commands soldiers who served under them in the war. |
| 5 | The villain is an ex-soldier with a grudge against citizens of a former enemy nation. |
| 6 | The villain wants the power to restart, and "properly" finish, the war. |

### Fortified Outpost
Military outposts across Khorvaire serve a variety of purposes during and after the war: rest stops for platoons on the move, garrisons for inactive troops, armories where weapons are stored, staging points for scouts and rangers who keep an eye on nearby enemy movements, and defensive fortifications meant to protect passes, bridges, or other key strategic locations. In an adventure, virtually anything can happen in or around it.

#### Fortified Outpost Features
This outpost, as shown on map 4.5, is a simple building holding barracks, officers' quarters, and storage areas encased within multiple rings of fortification. A normal approach to the inner compound involves passing through one of two gate houses (protected by arrow slits and murder holes), crossing an open courtyard (with more arrow slits and defenders on the rooftop above), passing through another small gate area, and traversing the training yard before finally reaching the lone entrance.

An enormous magic weapon akin to a ballista is mounted atop the outpost and supported by a massive stone column. Depending on the outpost, this weapon might launch ballista bolts with tremendous force and speed, expel surges of lightning, hurl fireballs, or otherwise send devastating munitions at approaching enemies.

A basement area is dedicated to storage, including holding cells to contain prisoners of war while they wait to be transported to dedicated prison camps.

| 8 | The outpost was built on the foundations of an ancient goblin fortress, and treasures are rumored to lie buried beneath it. |

## Lord of Blades
![[117-4-04.png|right|300]]

Stalking the Mournland like a spectral juggernaut, **the Lord of Blades** has emerged from the turmoil of the Last War as a symbol that calls to all the warforged of Khorvaire. Regardless of what they have become, the warforged were created to fight and die on the orders of their creators. Some warforged accept their history for what it is and look toward the future, but others hold a grudge because of how they were exploited by their creators. Those warforged make up the followers of **the Lord of Blades**.

**The Lord of Blades** preaches of an apocalyptic future in which the warforged will destroy or enslave the nations of flesh and blood. "We were made as weapons," **the Lord of Blades** has declared over and over. "Let us be weapons! Let the nations of the land reap what they have sown!"

Today, warforged roam the Mournland in service to **the Lord of Blades**, patrolling the devastated terrain and salvaging resources from the ashes of Cyre. Most of these dissidents despise creatures of flesh, and any meeting with outsiders usually ends in blood being spilled. Other disciples of **the Lord of Blades** launch attacks on targets across Khorvaire: destroying Cannith workshops, killing nobles known for their abuse of warforged, and seizing shipments of weapons or arcane research to further deplete their enemy.

To the flesh-and-blood citizens of Khorvaire, **the Lord of Blades** is a figure of terror and pain. But the warforged under his sway (and some objective observers of other races) believe that his rage is fueled by the injustice heaped upon the warforged after their creation. The warforged were treated as disposable soldiers, almost slaves, during the war, and the postwar arguments over what rights the warforged should be granted—as if fundamental rights were meant to be bestowed or withheld by political authorities—gave the warforged themselves no voice, as if they were still the property of their creators. **The Lord of Blades**' call to action is appealing to many warforged because it is grounded in legitimate grievances, even if the proposed action is abhorrent.

Compared to the total number of warforged created and deployed in combat during the Last War, the followers of **the Lord of Blades** are not especially numerous. His existence and message are well-known in the countries bordering the Mournland (especially Breland), but less familiar in the rest of Khorvaire. Hoping to swell the ranks of his followers, **the Lord of Blades** has agents spreading his apocalyptic message in every city with significant warforged populations.

### The Lord of Blades in the War
**The Lord of Blades** didn't appear in the world until after the Day of Mourning. Only he knows what his identity was before then, but many suppositions have been put forth. Some scholars say that he was originally a warforged named Bulwark, the personal bodyguard of King Boranel of Breland. Others believe that he was the last warforged to emerge from the creation forges at Eston, completed in the last moments before the Mourning.

Perhaps the most outlandish idea is that **the Lord of Blades** is not a true warforged at all. The first warforged were created by an artificer named Aaren d'Cannith, who became furious when the house used his invention to create weapons of war. Based on that knowledge, some believe Aaren transferred his consciousness into a warforged body so that he could personally seek vengeance for the wrongs done to his children.

In the years following the war, **the Lord of Blades** is a force to be reckoned with. The warforged are some of the few beings able to thrive in the desolation of the Mournland, so the followers of **the Lord of Blades** are building a nation of their own amid the devastation. They search out and scour sites that were devastated in the Mourning to gather lost weapons and magic, all part of their preparations for full-scale war against the creatures of flesh.

### Warforged Ossuary
A warforged ossuary is a former temple, crypt, or warehouse deep in the Mournland that now houses the remains of slain warforged. It is a place of honor and reflection for **the Lord of Blades** and his followers.

#### Warforged Ossuary Features
The ossuary depicted in map 4.6 was once a temple, which has been refitted into a resting place for **the Lord of Blades**' followers. Equal parts crypt, monument, vault, and workshop, the ossuary serves many functions for the warforged who maintain it. Other ossuaries exist in a variety of locations. The basic functions of these places remain the same, regardless of the original purpose of the structure. **The Lord of Blades**' warforged troops defend these sites with their lives.

| 5 | Extract a warforged spy from within **the Lord of Blades**' followers who is close to being discovered. |

### Lord of Blades NPCs
**The Lord of Blades** highlights the issues surrounding the creation of the warforged. He and his followers are ready antagonists, employing deadly methods in pursuit of their aims, but their ire isn't born from evil. **The Lord of Blades**' greatest desire is to ensure that his people have a future, but his methods are colored by his anger at the injustices the warforged have suffered, and in some cases are still being subjected to. Examples of villains linked to **the Lord of Blades** appear in **the Lord of Blades** NPCs table.

### Lord of Blades Campaign Themes

>> ##### The Voice of Thrane—Do They Know the War Is Over?
>>Against all logic and reason, people in Breland continue to argue that the warforged—creations of House Cannith, lest we forget—are living people with souls, deserving of the same rights as the rest of us. And yet, while philosophical debates rage and street protests grow heated, warforged who inhabit the dead land of Cyre continue to fight as if the war had not ended, launching raids out of the "dead-gray mist" to the neighboring lands—including, of course, Thrane. Proclaiming allegiance to something called the "Lord of Blades," these warforged don't seem to recognize the people of Thrane as living people with souls, so it's hard to appreciate why we should treat them that way.
>>

**The Lord of Blades** is a charismatic leader seeking to incite the warforged to violence and thereby to take vengeance against their former oppressors. Although low-level characters might not be prepared to face **the Lord of Blades** himself, they can easily encounter a squad of his followers anywhere on Khorvaire.

While **the Lord of Blades** and his minions can be a straightforward foe, it's also possible to add more depth to the conflict. Perhaps a squad of warforged attacks a foundry in Sharn. After repelling the attack, the adventurers realize that the owners are mistreating the warforged who work the forges. What do they do?

Another way to explore the facets of this issue is to introduce a warforged supporter of **the Lord of Blades** who doesn't engage in violence personally, such as a bard who moves among the warforged of a major city while speaking about the many abuses leveled against warforged. Especially if one of them is a warforged, how would the characters react to this individual?

**The Lord of Blades** can serve as a long-term opponent, as he continue to escalate his attacks over the course of the campaign. While he builds up his stronghold in the Mournland, he is also gathering the components to construct eldritch machines and other weapons. What would happen if **the Lord of Blades** were to discover the power that caused the Mourning and unleashed that power across Khorvaire?

## The Lords of Dust
Evil entities spawned at the dawn of time still haunt Eberron. The cities raised by those ancient overlords are now only ashes, but the Lords of Dust still dream of restoring their primordial dominion. These fiends bide their time in an inconceivably long game, sparring with the dragons of Argonnessen as they manipulate events in order to fulfill the words of the Draconic Prophecy in a way that will bring them victory.

Though the Lords of Dust are mighty enough on their own, they serve greater masters known as the overlords (see *chapter 6*). Unfathomably powerful fiends, the overlords were bound at the end of the Age of Demons by the power of the Silver Flame, and an overlord can be released from this binding only if doing so can be made to fulfill the Draconic Prophecy. Every fiend spawned from Khyber owes fealty to one of these overlords.

In many ways the Lords of Dust are a reflection of the Chamber. Each group is trying to steer the fulfillment of the Prophecy to serve its own ends. The goal of the Lords of Dust is to release the overlords from their bindings and loose them upon Eberron in a new age of darkness. Despite this unified goal, the Lords of Dust operate as an alliance of like-minded cabals rather than a single monolithic organization. Each cabal serves its particular overlord above all others, and the conditions that release one overlord could actually contradict those that would free another.

Accomplished shapeshifters, the Lords of Dust have agents spread across Khorvaire. Some might wonder why, with all their talents, they haven't tried to conquer the world already. The reason is that they have no interest in ruling this world; they want to return it to the state of unnatural glory that existed before. Their only interest in humanoids races is in directing them and their affairs down the paths necessary to release their overlords; aside from that, dealing with mortals is a tedious chore.

### The Lords of Dust and the War
The Lords of Dust took part in the events of the Last War whenever they saw opportunities to further their dark version of the Prophecy. It remains difficult to identify what events might have been manipulated by one of these fiends, because their schemes take so long to play out. Far in the future, it might become apparent that a seeming victory for the forces of good, or a battle averted that spared hundreds from death was ultimately the first step in an overlord's release. (For instance, a soldier who was otherwise fated to die in the battle that was avoided goes on to tempt a good-hearted priest into becoming corrupted.)

In the years since the Thronehold Accords, the Lords of Dust continue on as they ever have, advancing one small step at a time.

### Demon Ruin
The Lords of Dust maintain a variety of safe houses and sanctums across Eberron, but their most tightly bound locations are the ruins left behind from the Age of Demons, scattered across the Demon Wastes.

#### Demon Ruin Features
Map 4.7 what a demon ruin might look like. A demon ruin is an echo of grandeur swathed in flame and ravaged by time. Despite the rich appointments and impeccable construction evident even in the broken remains of the building, the place carries the unmistakable air of anguish and torment.

| 1 | Make a desperate request for aid from a Lord of Dust who is, by all accounts, an enemy of the characters' adversary. |
| 2 | Escort an innocent who is prophesied to destroy the Lord of Dust to the ruin, and there confront the fiend. |
| 3 | Carry an artifact to the river of black lava that runs through the demon ruin, which is the only place where the item can be truly destroyed. |
| 4 | Gather obsidian shards from the ruin as components for a rare spell. |

### Lords of Dust NPCs
Most of the Lords of Dust are rakshasas, but any sort of fiend—devil, demon, or otherwise—could be part of this organization. Such fiends are spawned in Khyber and aren't actually from the Outer Planes. These fiends generally work through a wide network of duped pawns and indebted servitors.

Each overlord has a chief servant, and these leaders meet in the ruins of Ashtakala in the Demon Wastes. *Chapter 6* contains statistics for the overlord **Rak Tulkhesh** and his speaker, **Mordakhesh** the Shadowsword. The overlord **Sul Khatesh** is served by the rakshasa Hektula, also known as the First Scribe. Durastoran the Wyrmbreaker is the speaker of Bel Shalor, the overlord said to be bound in Flamekeep.

The Lords of Dust NPCs table describes some possible antagonists who might cross paths with adventurers.

##### Lords of Dust NPCs
| d6 | NPC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A virtuous paladin is hunting and destroying those who might one day thwart the Lords of Dust. |
| 2 | A possessed lord or lady spreads corruption throughout the noble house. |
| 3 | A wizard who sought to accelerate their own power by making a dark bargain must now pay the price demanded by their sinister patron. |
| 4 | A powerful demon has corrupted the local ruler in the name of its overlord. |
| 5 | A **succubus** or **incubus** tempts a mercenary warlord to engage in greater and greater battles. |
| 6 | One of the characters' most trusted allies or servants turns out to be a **rakshasa** in disguise. |

### Lords of Dust Campaign Themes
The Lords of Dust have two basic goals. The first is to encourage activities that strengthen the influence of their overlords. **Rak Tulkhesh** embodies war and conflict, and his minions are always eager to cause strife. The servants of **Sul Khatesh** entice cruel and selfish people to become warlocks, drawing mystical powers from their mistress. These activities won't release an overlord, but they help to sustain it.

To release an overlord, the Lords of Dust must ensure that the Prophecy unfolds along a specific path. Often, following this path requires specific mortals to do specific deeds. For example, one shred of the Prophecy could stipulate that King Boranel has to be killed by one of the characters. The Lords of Dust could easily kill Boranel themselves, but that wouldn't be sufficient to bring about the desired end; somehow, they'll have to trick the adventurer into doing it.

Because the Lords of Dust so often work through pawns and minions, it might take a while for adventurers to realize that an apparently unconnected series of encounters early in a campaign are actually all part of the complex schemes of the Lords of Dust. These fiends are so devious that it is often impossible to discern a pattern to their actions until their plans have come to fruition and the connections have finally been made clear. (You could retroactively decide that what you intended as unconnected encounters were all part of the plan from the beginning!)

## The Mournland
Once, Cyre shone more brightly than any of its sibling nations in the kingdom of Galifar. It was the center of the kingdom's wealth, a monument to its artistic and arcane achievements, and the site of great centers of learning where preeminent masters of magic, architecture, and artifice taught at the forefront of their craft. It was also the home of House Cannith and its massive foundries: some of them built on mountains or in mountains, some gracefully spanning canyons, and others erected in vast labyrinths deep underground.

Today, this region is a festering wound across Khorvaire. A wall of mist surrounds a land twisted into strange and terrible shapes. Cyre was once called the Jewel of Galifar. Now it is the Mournland.

### The Mourning
No one knows the reason for what happened on 20 Olarune 994 YK. Though it had been battered, Cyre stood defiant; Cyran soldiers had recently driven deep into Karrnathi territory and were holding their lines against the combined forces of Breland and Thrane.

And then it all came to an end.

Some say that the dead-gray mist began in Metrol, initially flowing out of the royal palaces of Vermishard. Others swear that the disaster began in the Cannith stronghold of Making. All that is known is that the mist swiftly spread across the kingdom, transforming the lands and creatures caught within it. Over a million people died in the Mourning, including nearly all of the inhabitants of central Cyre. The mist slowed its advance as it spread, and some of those in the borderlands heard of the disaster in time to flee. Others survived because they were already beyond the borders of Cyre; the mist stopped mere feet away from the camps of Cyran soldiers holding sections of the Brelish front. And though the vast majority of people caught in the Mourning died, thousands did survive. Most have no clear memory of the event, and there's no explanation for why they were spared. The superstitious say that these people are cursed, that anyone touched by the Mourning is now an agent of darkness. (See the book's *introduction* for further details on how the Mourning might have affected characters.)

In the days immediately following the Mourning, many assumed that the mist would continue to spread. Intense panic slowly turned to curiosity as it became clear that the border had stabilized. Over the last four years, people have ventured into the mist for many reasons. Some sought to plunder the abandoned treasures of the richest nation in Galifar. Others hoped to find lost loved ones, or some explanation for the disaster. Few of these explorers have returned, and those survivors all tell tales of a land twisted in unpredictable and inexplicable ways.

### Mournland Environment
The arcane energies that caused the Day of Mourning and that linger in the remains of Cyre are mysterious and unpredictable, so they can be the cause of any bizarre magical effect you want to bring to bear in your game.

>> ##### The Korranberg Chronicle—Cataclysm in Cyre!
>>A magical catastrophe of unknown origin engulfed the nation of Cyre yesterday, bringing a century of war to an explosive climax. Surely when the children of King Jarot began their squabbles over succession a hundred years ago, they could not have foreseen the horror that would engulf the home of Queen Mishann. Our reporters are still sifting through accounts of what has happened, but it is clear at this point that beautiful Cyre, the jewel of Galifar's vast holdings, has disappeared behind a churning cloud of dead-gray mist.
>>

Maps of Cyre from before the Day of Mourning are of limited use nowadays. The land beyond the gray mist has been twisted and warped, and distances seem to expand and shrink even as one treks across the wastes. As a result, any Wisdom (Survival) check or any check using navigator's tools made to negotiate the Mournland is made with disadvantage.

As if the difficulties of navigation weren't bad enough, explorers must bring their own provisions into the Mournland, unless they want to risk the danger of ingesting tainted food and water.

#### Terrain Features
The Day of Mourning redefined the geography of Cyre. The cataclysm raised land, swallowed lakes, and moved whole cities. In some areas, the earth has been torn and gouged as if by some colossal beast. In others, it has become iridescent glass or semiliquid sludge. Trees in one place turned to crystalline onyx; the flowers in another place begin eerily buzzing when touched by a breeze. Nothing in the Mournland is as it was; the entire land is a scar left by the catastrophe of the Mourning.

***Mist Wall.*** The borders of the Mournland are defined by a wall of thick, gray mist that rises thousands of feet into the air and forms a canopy that hides the ruined realm even from above.

The area covered by the mist is a shadowy, muffled region devoid of life, sunlight, and sound. The wall of mist ranges in thickness from a few hundred feet to as much as five miles. Travelers who linger in the mist suffer a growing sense of claustrophobia and despair. It's easy to get lost in the impenetrable fog, and some travelers have wandered in circles, unable to find their way either through the mist or back outside it, until their food or water ran out or they blundered into the path of some mutated terror. The DC for Wisdom (Survival) checks to avoid getting lost in the mists is 15. (See "*Becoming Lost*" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.)

Patches of mist and less oppressive fog dot the interior of the Mournland, but the worst effects of the mist are confined to the border region.

***Glowing Chasm.*** The northern part of the Mournland is dominated by a great crack in the ground that emits a cold purple light. This supernatural glow emanates from deep within the Glowing Chasm, so far beneath the surface that its source hasn't been identified. The mutated monsters that roam the Mournland seem drawn to this location, and those that spend any significant time near the Glowing Chasm mutate further, becoming more twisted and misshapen than before.

***Crimson Water.*** Before the Mourning, a spring in the eastern part of Cyre fed the Rushing River as it traced a short but fertile path south to Kraken Bay. The bed of the Rushing River is now as dry and barren as the rest of the Mournland, and the location of the spring is marked by the Crimson Water, a stagnant lake of blood-colored liquid.

The shores of the Crimson Water are littered with the remains of animals and travelers that have strayed into the Mournland and sought to slake their thirst with a drink from the lake. At the lake bottom is the ruined town of Eastwood Springs, which once served as a resort for the leisure classes of Cyre. As yet, no one has been brave or foolish enough to search for lost treasures in the depths of the Crimson Water.

***Unusual Locations.*** At places smaller in scale than the major features described above, explorers in the Mournland might encounter any kind of terrain feature with bizarre magical properties. The Unusual Locations table offers some ideas.

##### Unusual Locations
| d6 | Location |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A pool of glowing water sits in the middle of a ruined and abandoned village. Anyone who looks into the water sees brief reflections of the long-dead villagers going about their lives in harmony and joy. |
| 2 | In the middle of the wreckage of a carnival stands a perfectly preserved carousel. If the carousel is ridden, the characters doing so see visions of Cyre as it was before the Last War. |
| 3 | All the trees and plants in a forest have been turned to objects of glossy white stone with blood-red flecks. |
| 4 | The battlefield before the characters contains no bodies, only the clothing and weapons of thousands of missing soldiers. |
| 5 | The broken bodies of soldiers lie scattered across a battlefield, refusing to decompose. |
| 6 | The characters find a fallen warforged colossus (described later in this section). |

#### Creatures of the Mournland
Many creatures were slain outright by the Mourning. Others were mutated as the land was transformed. Sometimes the result was an entirely new life form; any previously unseen monster could appear as a spawn of the Mourning. Other creatures retained a semblance of their original physiology while taking on some sort of alteration. The Monstrous Mutations table has options for altering existing monsters to reflect this phenomenon.

Most warforged were unaffected by the Mourning, and the race as a whole seems immune to many of the lingering effects that plague the Mournland. As such, the warforged who follow **the Lord of Blades** constitute the closest thing to a humanoid society that can be found in the Mournland. Similarly, golems and other constructs were largely unaffected by the Mourning.

The Mourning had no effect on existing undead, and a large number of new undead came into being when the cataclysm occurred. Various spirits (such as ghosts and specters) linger near the places where they died, and the corpses that litter an abandoned battlefield might rise up to continue fighting whenever a living creature comes near. Some of these entities are similar to undead that might be encountered outside the Mournland, but others have alterations that are tied to the unusual manner of their deaths. You can use the *Monstrous Mutations table* to generate some details. Many of the mutations on this table might increase a creature's challenge rating by 1 or 2. Use the guidelines in *chapter 9* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to determine whether its challenge rating should increase and by how much, or you can simply increase it by 1 or 2 as you see fit.

Many Mournland creatures have mutations that are purely cosmetic and don't change their stat blocks. For example, one might have eyes that look like gemstones or might display glowing patterns on its skin or fur.

##### Monstrous Mutations
| d6 | Mutation |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The creature has grown to an unusual size. You can either set its new size and alter its statistics using the guidelines in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, or apply the enlarge effect of the *enlarge/reduce* spell to it. |
| 2 | The creature has developed magical camouflage. It gains proficiency in the Stealth skill, and it has the Chameleon Skin trait: it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. |
| 3 | The creature's body has been infused with one kind of energy: acid, cold, fire, or lightning (your choice, or determine randomly). Its melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of that type, and it has the Elemental Body trait: a creature that touches it or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) damage of that type. You can adjust these damage numbers to suit the creature's challenge rating. |
| 4 | The creature has the Magic Resistance trait: it has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. |
| 5 | The creature has a supernatural ability to heal its wounds. It has the Regeneration trait: it regains hit points at the start of its turn equal to the maximum value of one of its Hit Dice. If it takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the creature's next turn. (A particular creature might be susceptible to different damage types.) The creature dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate. |
| 6 | The creature has two heads. If it has a bite attack, it can use Multiattack as an action to make two bite attacks. (If it already has Multiattack, it adds a bite attack to its attack routine.) It also gains the Two Heads trait: it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious. |

#### Magical Effects
The catastrophe of the Mourning altered more than the landscape and living creatures. The devastation caused localized alterations in the way magic functions. In some places, magic barely functions, or certain magical functions are warped. In other places, spells persist past the instant of their casting and start behaving as if they were independent, living creatures.

A common misunderstanding about the Mournland is that healing spells refuse to work. The fact is that healing spells are impeded within the dead-gray mist, and occasionally in other areas, making it harder for someone to cast them effectively. Because so few expeditions make it far past the mist, the inability to heal is widely assumed to be a property of the Mournland as a whole.

The Environmental Effects table provides suggestions for weird magic that might pervade a small or large area of the Mournland. Effects might shift from day to day or even hour to hour.

##### Environmental Effects
| d8 | Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Healing spells are impeded here. Any spell that restores hit points does so as if it were cast at a level one lower than the spell slot expended. A spell cast using a 1st-level slot restores no hit points. |
| 2 | A character who casts a spell must make a Constitution saving throw against the character's own spell save DC. On a failed save, the character takes psychic damage equal to the spell's level and gains one level of exhaustion. |
| 3 | Any Medium humanoid that dies in the area reanimates as a **zombie** at the start of its next turn. The zombie is under the DM's control. |
| 4 | The area is affected by a *silence* spell. |
| 5 | Each creature that enters the area is affected by an *enlarge/reduce* spell, with an equal chance for each effect. The effect lasts until the creature leaves the area. |
| 6 | The pull of gravity is lessened. Creatures can jump twice the normal distance in any direction, and everything effectively weighs half its actual weight. |
| 7 | All creatures are linked to every other creature in the area as if by the *telepathy* spell. |
| 8 | A creature that casts a spell of 1st level or higher in the area rolls on the Wild Magic Surge table in chapter 3 of the *Player's Handbook*. |

### Sites and Ruins
Of all the bizarre and horrific spectacles of the Mournland, perhaps the greatest tragedy is represented by the ruins of the once-glittering cities of Cyre. Some have been reduced to rubble, while others are eerily preserved, devoid of life but otherwise unharmed. In some of them, treasures left behind by the former inhabitants await discovery, and many people across Khorvaire are eager to get their hands on such spoils for a wide variety of reasons.

#### Battlefields and the Field of Ruins
Cyre was the site of incessant battles during the Last War, from the first extended campaign—the siege of Eston in 895 YK—to the running battle on the Saerun Road that was cut short when the Mourning occurred. Battlefields across the Mournland, both ancient and recent, stand like open graves as evidence of the horrors of the war. In some places, armies that were fighting on the Day of Mourning became stone statues anchored in position. Others were crystallized or reduced to ash.

On the Field of Ruins—around the Saerun Road in the southwest part of the Mournland, where allied forces of Thrane and Breland battled an outnumbered Cyran army on the Day of Mourning—the fallen soldiers are preserved just as they fell, with no sign of rot or decay. Thousands upon thousands of corpses lie scattered across the field, facedown in the dirt or staring lifelessly at the gray sky. Even seasoned bands of treasure hunters are loath to enter the Field of Ruins.

#### Eston
House Cannith was born in Eston, and the house's labors transformed the city into a place of wonders. Clockwork birds perched and sang in silvery trees covered in steel bark. Skycoaches carried smiths and magewrights from forge to forge, and an iridescent dome protected the city from storms and harsh winds. On the proving grounds of the Cannith creation forges, cadres of newborn warforged learned the combat skills that would prepare them for active duty.

Eston began as a successful mining settlement, extracting iron and rare ores from the nearby hills. Drawing on these resources, the Cannith artificers in Eston spent decades researching all sorts of artificial creatures, which eventually gave rise to the warforged.

Because of these wonders, Eston is an irresistible attraction for treasure hunters hoping to access the vaults of House Cannith. Reports suggest, however, that it has become a strange and deadly place. It's said that the city is overrun by living spells. In addition to the remnants of damaging spells (see "*Living Spells*" in *chapter 6*), there are stranger phenomena: living *continual flames* that crawl along the streets, cling to lampposts, and flee from strangers, and living *scrying* spells that shift and shimmer, displaying distant scenes on their amorphous skin.

Eston was renowned for its clockwork menagerie and its steel gardens, a showcase that chronicles House Cannith's centuries of work developing constructs and homunculi. These creatures have been twisted by the Mourning and have become deadly monsters. Stories tell of an enormous gorgon golem, of razor-winged swarms of silver songbirds, and many other equally strange things.

#### Making and the Glass Plateau
Many people believe that the city of Making was at the epicenter of whatever caused the Mourning. The cataclysm reshaped the terrain around the city, creating the great highland formation known as the Glass Plateau.

The Glass Plateau is mostly smooth and flat, though jagged spikes and spires jut up from the ground in seemingly random places. The central portion of the highland plain is obsidian, and bursts of fiery light can sometimes be seen in its dark depths. Toward the edges of the plateau, the glass becomes lighter in color and more transparent, appearing almost pale white along the jagged cliffs at the edge. Nothing grows on the plain of glass, and few creatures haunt its jagged peaks and flat expanse.

The ruins of Making still peek through the obsidian flats of the Glass Plateau. Those who believe that the Mourning started here also expect that Making is where the mystery of its origin will be unraveled. A secret Cannith facility is supposed to lie in the city's subterranean depths.

#### Metrol
This city was once the capital of Cyre. Now it lies empty, seemingly waiting along the Cyre River for its people to return. Parts of Metrol have been shattered, their buildings crushed and tumbled by whatever force destroyed the nation. Other portions of the city escaped with superficial damage; aside from the absence of people and the shroud of mist that hangs over the area, it looks much as it did before Cyre fell. The days in Metrol are quiet, but the nights bring a cacophony of chaos and violence to the streets—at night, misshapen monsters emerge from their lairs to prowl and wail as they hunt each other for food.

![[124-4-07.png|right|300]](Metrol)

### Mournland Villains
Few people have reason to spend time anywhere near the Mournland. Among the exceptions are those who seek to plunder the riches of lost Cyre, such as Ikar's Salvage (described below). These treasure hunters are also the kind of people who make interesting villains, teaming up with adventurers one day and betraying them the next.

In addition to these salvagers, **the Lord of Blades** (described in more detail earlier in this chapter and in *chapter 6*) is a major force in the Mournland. The Mournland Villains table suggests other possible evil schemes and influences that might arise in connection with the Mournland.

##### Mournland Villains
| d6 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **The Lord of Blades** maintains a detention center where experiments are performed on adventurers and scavengers that his forces capture in the Mournland. |
| 2 | The leader of a cult devoted to **Belashyrra**, the Lord of Eyes, uses daelkyr-made tentacles to tear out the eyes of victims and attaches them to members of the cult. |
| 3 | A powerful member of House Cannith hopes to find something in the Mournland that will guarantee the ascendancy of her branch of the house. |
| 4 | A Karrnathi **bone knight** (see *chapter 6*) wants to raise up an undead army from the corpses in the Mournland. |
| 5 | A **rakshasa** works to free a fiendish overlord trapped in a whirlwind of stone and sand somewhere in the Mournland. |
| 6 | A servant of the Lords of Dust maintains an extensive collection of severed heads and continues to draw on the knowledge in their brains. |

### Adventures and Encounters
In contrast to the salvagers and treasure hunters who undertake most of the expeditions to the Mournland, some individuals enter the churning mist with good intentions in mind. Most of these adventurers are displaced Cyrans or are hired by such people, ranging from common folk hoping to retrieve family heirlooms to servants of Prince Oargev, who hopes to recover the lost regalia of the Cyran crown.

Two of the dragonmarked houses, Orien and Cannith, also have vested interests in investigating the Mournland's ruins and often hire adventurers to pursue those interests. House Orien wants to restore the lightning rail line that crosses the Mournland, which would reconnect the western and eastern halves of Khorvaire. House Cannith wants to recover trade secrets, experimental artifacts, and magic items from the creation forges, foundries, and secret laboratories it lost on the Day of Mourning.

The Mournland Adventure Hooks table includes a range of potential opportunities that could lead a group of adventurers into the Mournland.

##### Mournland Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A Gatekeeper druid wants a rock sample from the Glass Plateau. |
| 2 | A magewright from House Cannith wants the party to escort him to a *warforged colossus*. The magewright wants to retrieve the docent network from the colossus before an unscrupulous House Phiarlan operative does so. |
| 3 | On her deathbed, the visionary artist who designed the lightning rail station at Metrol reveals that she hid a treasure map within a lamp in her old office. |
| 4 | A wealthy eccentric asks the party to go into the Mournland and retrieve his most prized possession (a letter from a lover, a mechanical caterpillar, or anything else you devise) from his mansion. |
| 5 | A young Cyran paladin is morose because she was away from Cyre on a mission when the Day of Mourning occurred and never got to say goodbye to her family. She longs to retrieve her father's sword. |
| 6 | An elderly knight is strapping on his armor one last time so he can ride into the Mournland and die on the battlefield where his companions perished and "where I should have been." |

#### Encounters and Trinkets
The Mournland is a dangerous place full of bizarre, inexplicable, and often localized magical effects—literally anything can happen in this place. The Mournland Encounters table and the Mournland Trinkets table offer just a glimpse of the weirdness that adventurers might come across in their travels into the ruins of Cyre.

##### Mournland Encounters
| d6 | Encounter |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The party meets flickering images of their future selves who are trying desperately to communicate, but their message is garbled. |
| 2 | The party encounters a **revenant** who was murdered by House Cannith assassins after she learned too much about the house's secret research. The characters can appease her by promising to help her get revenge. |
| 3 | A tiny kitten mews from inside a hollow log. Within a few hours after being freed, it grows into an adult **displacer beast**. |
| 4 | The apparition of a parent searches for their lost child. As soon as the two are reunited, parent and spirit child both vanish. |
| 5 | The mist congeals into the form of a long-lost love of one of the adventurers. The mist apparition (use the **ghost** stat block) wants the character to stay here forever. |
| 6 | The characters come across the skull of a buried warforged colossus. |

##### Mournland Trinkets
| d10 | Trinket |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The favorite childhood toy of one of the adventurers, floating in midair |
| 2 | A tin whistle that makes beautiful colors and patterns magically appear when it's played |
| 3 | A toy lightning rail car |
| 4 | A glass eye |
| 5 | A silver lapel pin of a finely detailed gorgon's head with ruby eyes |
| 6 | A monocle that can be used as a telescope |
| 7 | A six-inch-tall mechanical marmoset in need of minor repairs |
| 8 | A small medallion made of silver, depicting a tower with an eye at the top of it and other smaller eyes embedded in the sides |
| 9 | A cloak pin made of iron in the shape of two hammers joined by a semicircular haft |
| 10 | A wooden dinosaur toy that has movable legs |

### Warforged Colossus
Mere weeks before the Day of Mourning, House Cannith unleashed its mightiest creations: the warforged colossi. Hundreds of feet tall, these gargantuan warriors thundered across Cyre, crushing everything in their path and leaving ruin in their wake. Meant to end the war decisively, these arcane war machines could pulverize soldiers beneath their feet and incinerate entire legions with beams of red light radiating from their mouths. But as the colossi were beginning to turn to the lands outside Cyre, the Mourning came, and the colossi perished. Now their remains lie, like mountains, in the Mournland, filled with secrets and waiting to be explored.

#### History of the Colossi
House Cannith spent much of the war working on various kinds of constructs that could serve as soldiers, siege engines, or other weapons of war. Their earliest efforts, which lumbered onto Cyran battlefields in the late 930s YK, were barely more than golems with limited sentience, difficult to command in the field. The warforged titans were developed over the next twenty years, and the modern warforged—often perceived as the pinnacle of Cannith engineering—first saw battle in 965.

Successful as the warforged were, though, House Cannith never lost interest in building a better titan. Cyre didn't lose its desire for deadly weapons that could give it an edge over its enemies, and tremendous amounts of gold flowed from Cyre's coffers into the vaults of House Cannith as research and development continued, working toward a new kind of warforged that would bring an end to the war once and for all, and establish Cyre's martial supremacy for centuries to come.

With Cyre's immense wealth fueling its effort, House Cannith called upon the ingenuity of its best artificers and magewrights. Construction began on enormous new creation foundries, hundreds of feet tall, carved into the sides of mountains or secretly nestled within remote canyons.

The project succeeded beyond Cyre's wildest dreams. When the original warforged colossus took its first thunderous footsteps, it was met with a reaction of equal parts awe and horror—and it was almost immediately sent north toward Metrol, where armies from Karrnath were menacing the Cyran capital.

#### Operating a Colossus
A warforged colossus is part warforged and part vehicle. It stands between 200 and 300 feet tall. For optimal performance, a colossus required an active crew including a captain with the Mark of Making, a weapons officer with the Mark of Storm, and a helmsman with the Mark of Passage. When absolutely necessary, though, the colossus could direct itself but at diminished power. A colossus also carried a sizable contingent of elite troops, who could ride in safety within the colossus while it crushed through enemy lines or smashed through a wall, then pour out through hatches once the colossus was in position.

***Docent Network.*** Controlling a construct of such size proved to be a great challenge for the Cannith artificers. The solution entailed creating a large number of *docent* nodes and joining them together in a single network distributed throughout the body of the colossus. Docent nodes are modeled after the ancient *docents* found in Xen'drik (described in *chapter 5*), and though they lack the full sentience or functionality of a true *docent*, collectively they can guide and control a colossus. The network converged at one place, where the captain could stand and control the colossus's every movement through the use of a mithral helmet with hundreds of semi-organic tendril-wires attached. By way of the central master *docent*—a true *docent* recovered from Xen'drik—the whole network fed information back to the operator. Several smaller "hubs" of the network gave other operators access to the relevant parts of that information and enabled them to control parts of the colossus as well. The techniques and tools used to create *docent* nodes were lost in the Mourning. The various branches of House Cannith are sending adventurers into the Mournland in hopes of salvaging some or all of the network inside a fallen colossus.

***Colossus Power Core.*** The power source of a colossus is a Khyber dragonshard of unusually large size, cut into a specific pattern that allows the dragonshard to contain raw magical energy without exploding. A single power core is about the size of a wine barrel, hooked up to an elaborate harness that distributes power throughout the colossus.

***Weapons of Mass Destruction.*** Warforged colossi were physically powerful, but their principal weaponry involved the use of bound elementals. Some expelled blasts of elemental fire from their hands or mouths; others wielded adamantine swords they could wreathe in flame. Some colossi also used bound elementals for defense: manifesting shields of elemental rock, blasting out elemental air to deflect ranged attacks, and so on. The captain of the colossus could control all this weaponry through the *docent* network, but for optimal performance the captain relied on a weapons officer with the Mark of Storm to employ this elemental weaponry.

#### Finding a Colossus
When adventurers discover a colossus, it might be in any state. Some have fallen or collapsed and become overgrown with vegetation to the point where one could be mistaken for a small hill. One was engulfed when the rock under its feet turned to liquid and swallowed it up, encasing it in a stone prison when the rock hardened. Some are buried—except for the head, perhaps, or a hand, which serves as a clear indicator that something lies underneath.

Adventurers might even stumble upon a reality the world isn't ready to face: an operational **colossus** (see the stat block in *chapter 6*).

#### Entering a Colossus
Map 4.8 shows a fallen colossus. The mostly hollow interior of a colossus is large enough for the crew and soldiers to travel in safety. The area features tunnels, ladders, hallways and crawlways, control rooms, storage rooms, arbalest turrets, and observation decks. With comfort a low priority, only minimal crew quarters are provided, and the inside has no kitchen or dining areas. Normal operating procedure called for the crew to exit the colossus at night and camp outside it.

A colossus usually has multiple hatches to allow entrance and egress: on the legs, on the back, in the chest, in the mouth or on the back of the head, and so on. But entering the remains of a warforged colossus is not a task to be taken lightly, since the Mournland can have bizarre effects on the colossus's *docent* network, power core, and weaponry, as well as its mind.

***Elemental Life.*** Even though a colossus has fallen, its *docent* nodes and elemental defenses might still be active. The dragonshards that once bound the elemental that powered the colossus's main weapon might have been broken, allowing the elemental to escape from its bondage and roam the body of the colossus, which has become its lair. Or perhaps it has come under the control of the master *docent* and now does its twisted will, defending the interior of the colossus and giving voice and form to the *docent*'s otherwise disembodied intelligence.

***A Deadly Dungeon.*** House Cannith's artisans lined the interior of each colossus with magic wards and traps in case enemy soldiers breached its defenses. As long as the primary operator remained connected to the master *docent* and in control, the traps were inactive, but if the operator gave an alert (or simply left their station, or died), the master *docent* would send a signal through the network to seal the doors, activate the arcane wards, and arm the traps in any area that was under attack.

***A Grisly Tomb.*** Most colossi are tombs, filled with the bodies of the crews that perished in the cataclysm. But the Mourning affected everything in bizarre ways, so a venture inside a colossus is often terrifying. A horrific monster might have made its lair in a colossus's interior in the years since the Mourning. The master *docent* in another one might speak through the brass horns that the crews used to communicate, growing increasingly incoherent and/or sinister. The crew of a colossus might be undead—zombies lumbering through the colossus's interior, or spirits doomed to haunt it until they can find blessed release.

## Order of the Emerald Claw
What arose as an order of militant knights within the nation of Karrnath fell into disgrace and became a shattered remnant. The Order of the Emerald Claw now operates as a collection of cells of fanatical warriors, necromancers, and spies. On the surface, its members seem to be driven by Karrnathi patriotism, and they purport to be adherents of the Blood of Vol. The most cursory investigation reveals that claim to be a facade.

The truth behind the Emerald Claw is that they serve the lich **Lady Illmarrow**, and in her name they carry out acts of destruction, murder, and necromantic terrorism. They have been linked to the theft of powerful items imbued with necromancy magic, and they often employ vicious undead minions that make even other Karrns uncomfortable. Most worshipers of the Blood of Vol are quick to point out that they don't accept the order's claim to membership in their faith, and those true worshipers vehemently reject the Emerald Claw's violent fanaticism.

### The Emerald Claw and the War
During the Last War, Karrnath was forced to embrace the practice of necromancy to bolster the ranks of its army. At the same time, a number of chivalric orders were founded by devoted worshipers of the Blood of Vol. These groups included necromancers and bone knights that were trained to raise and command the undead troops used during the war. The Order of the Emerald Claw was one of the most infamous of these groups, renowned for its fighting skills but often sanctioned for its brutal treatment of enemy soldiers. The Emerald Claw were also accused of slaughtering civilians so they could be raised as skeletons or zombies—behavior that was strictly forbidden by the Karrnath commanders.

When King Kaius III came to power near the end of the war, he turned against the Blood of Vol. The orders were disbanded, and many members of the Emerald Claw were condemned as war criminals. While the other orders complied with the king's edict, many knights of the Emerald Claw refused to surrender. The order fragmented as its original members scattered, but a number of those rebellious knights started their own cells, rallying all who wanted to see Karrnath achieve its rightful glory. The order experienced a surge in membership following the Treaty of Thronehold because many Karrns thought that Kaius III had betrayed their nation by embracing peace.

Six years ago, shortly after Kaius's accession, a figure known as **Lady Illmarrow** emerged as the leader of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Few of her followers know anything about her, other than her great skill as a necromancer; many members of the Order refer to her as Queen of the Dead. Some members of the order believe she will ultimately raise Karrnath above all other nations. Others simply trust that she will grant them personal power. They believe that she is poised to become a god of death, and that when she ascends to divinity, they will be granted immortality or at least the eternal life of undeath.

### Library Vault
Map 4.9 shows a library vault maintained by the Order of the Emerald Claw. The order collects dark materials and forbidden magic and holds them for safekeeping in these heavily defended locations. Each vault also functions as a chapter house or a sanctuary for a local cell.

#### Library Vault Features
Library vaults can be found in a variety of locations. Some of them are crypts or dungeons secreted away underground, while others are hidden in plain sight inside a home or a business. Whatever its specific location, a vault is always equipped with defensive features, some of which remain active even after the outer door is breached.

![[128-map49_libraryvault-player.jpg|right|300]]((Player Version))
#### Library Vault Adventures
The Library Vault Adventures table outlines some possibilities for adventure involving one of these locations.

##### Library Vault Adventures
| d6 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Destroy a scroll containing an incantation that allows even non-spellcasters to animate the dead. |
| 2 | Steal the journal of a powerful necromancer that's being held in the vault's collection. |
| 3 | Trade a powerful dark magic weapon in return for the rescue of important hostages taken by the order. |
| 4 | Steal a suit of armor that contains the soul of a hero slain during the Last War. |
| 5 | Search the collection for information on the Queen of the Dead, or "**Lady Illmarrow**," as she is known. |
| 6 | Infiltrate the vault to get close to a new Emerald Claw recruit, then convince them to come to their senses and return to their family. |

### Order of the Emerald Claw NPCs
Given the undeniable nature of the order, villains associated with the Emerald Claw present an opportunity to provide characters with adversaries that are memorably evil, and that revel in their villainy.

##### Emerald Claw NPCs
| d6 | NPC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Though mortal, this fanatical warrior drinks the blood of those he slays in battle. |
| 2 | A cleric tries to convince her enemies to embrace the order, promising eternal life through undeath. |
| 3 | A noble with sympathies toward the order hides a cell's library vault within the grounds of their estate. |
| 4 | A suave vampire would rather charm its enemies than crush them in battle. |
| 5 | An artificer is obsessed with infusing necromantic curses into their construct creations. |
| 6 | A changeling necromancer often poses as a vampire or a mummy, even though it's still alive. |

### Emerald Claw Campaign Themes
At low levels, adventurers can clash with Emerald Claw skeletons and zombies. As the characters grow more capable, the threats escalate. They might have to protect a village from a necromancer who is sucking the life out of the land, or race through a dungeon to acquire a necromantic relic before the Claw can claim it. The Emerald Claw is ideally suited to pulp action; it's a force that is blatant in its villainy and has hordes of evil minions to do its bidding. Defeating the schemes of the Emerald Claw should always feel like the right thing to do.

Although many members of the Emerald Claw believe that they are fighting for Karrnath, they are truly serving the lich **Lady Illmarrow** (see *chapter 6*). The greatest necromancer of the age, she seeks to unlock the secrets of her inactive dragonmark, the Mark of Death. If she succeeds, she could come to possess unimaginable power. This makes her a formidable villain to drive the action of an entire campaign.

### Emerald Claw Adventure Hooks
The Emerald Claw Adventure Hooks table offers some options to kick off adventures featuring the Emerald Claw that take place outside their sanctuaries.

##### Emerald Claw Adventure Hooks
| d8 | NPC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | What at first appears to be a renegade group of Aundairian soldiers turn out to be undead under the order's control. |
| 2 | The order strikes at a small keep, demanding the inhabitants surrender a particular volume from their library. |
| 3 | Investigating strange lights and sounds emanating from a crypt in the dead of night reveals the Emerald Claw experimenting on the corpses within. |
| 4 | The Emerald Claw violates graves near a small village, animating the corpses into undead laborers to help build an eldritch machine. |
| 5 | The Emerald Claw claims a village's town hall for its own use, and any who come near are attacked. The sounds of torture ring out from within the building. |
| 6 | Investigating disappearances among an elf community reveals that the Order of the Emerald Claw has been attempting to inscribe something like a dragonmark in their skin, then reanimating the failed experiments as zombies. |
| 7 | While searching for a magic item in Dhakaani ruins across southern Khorvaire, the characters discover that Emerald Claw agents are looking for the same thing and seem to have access to information the adventurers lack. |
| 8 | A large force of Emerald Claw knights offers the characters a choice: join the order, or submit themselves to death and an eternity of servitude from beyond the grave. |

## Planes of Existence
Eberron is part of the Great Wheel of the multiverse, as described in the *Player's Handbook* and the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. At the same time, it is fundamentally apart from the rest of the Great Wheel, sealed off from the other planes even while it's encircled by its own wheeling cosmology. Eberron's unique station in the multiverse is an important aspect of the world: its planes have profound and shifting influences on the Material Plane, and it is sheltered from the influences and machinations of gods and other powers elsewhere on the Great Wheel.

The planet of Eberron is the heart of its own Material Plane. It is surrounded by the Ring of Siberys. Beyond this band of dragonshards, twelve moons orbit the world. To date, no creature from Eberron has explored the moons, and none can say whether they are lifeless rocks or thriving worlds. Some sages believe that the moons are connected to the planes, or that they might even be physical extensions of the planes, but the truth of these assertions remains unknown.

No other planets have been discovered within Eberron's Material Plane. The underworld of Khyber, however, contains a host of demiplanes, tiny pockets of altered reality. As such, venturing beneath the surface of Eberron can lead you to a network of caverns and passages, and if you find the right passage, it can take you to fantastic and deadly places inhabited by fiends, aberrations, and other children of Khyber.

![[130-map-planes-large.jpg|right|300]]((Player Version))
### Planes of Eberron
The Material Plane is enfolded by thirteen planes of existence. Many of these have aspects of both Outer Planes and Inner Planes. All of them overlap with Eberron in some way, and they influence and are influenced by the Material Plane. The intensity of this influence waxes and wanes; scholars often depict the planes as orbiting Eberron—sometimes coming close, other times far away—though this manner of expression is merely a metaphor for their shifting influence. When another plane's influence on the Material Plane is especially strong, the plane is said to be coterminous. When its influence is weak, a plane is remote. The state of a plane can be important for performing epic rituals, creating of eldritch machines, or interacting with extraplanar entities. Whether or not a plane is remote or coterminous at a given time depends entirely on the needs of your story.

#### Manifest Zones
At certain places in the Material Plane, the barriers between worlds are thin, and some characteristics of another plane can bleed through into the material world. These places are called manifest zones, and the nature of each one is strongly shaped by the plane it connects to. The city of Sharn is located in a manifest zone linked to Syrania that keeps its towers reaching toward the sky and aids flight. Ghosts might linger in a manifest zone associated with Dolurrh, while a manifest zone tied to Lamannia might have wild vegetation and enhance druidic magic. A manifest zone might include a portal that allows free passage from either plane to the other. The descriptions of other planes in this section offer some other possible effects. Most manifest zones have reliable, persistent effects. Some have only weak connections to their planes, and their properties influence the world only when the plane is coterminous.

## Tour of the Planes
Each of the thirteen planes in Eberron's cosmology is briefly described below, both in general terms as well as by the effects that occur or appear on the Material Plane in manifest zones linked to that plane.

### Daanvi, the Perfect Order
Daanvi embodies absolute order, along with the ideals of law and discipline and their impact on civilization. The perfectly ordered, immaculate districts of the plane represent different aspects of law: precisely maintained fields, legalistic tribunals, and hordes of modrons compiling archives of every rule or regulation ever created. Some districts are governed by a justice system based in goodness, where laws help to maintain harmony. In more oppressive locations, harsh laws are imposed on the suffering populace by tyrannical devils.

##### Daanvi Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | People who live in the manifest zone are inclined to follow duly enacted regulations without question, regardless of moral implications. |
| 2 | Creatures can't tell deliberate lies while in the area. |
| 3 | Flora and fauna are preternaturally orderly and homogeneous. Trees here grow in neat rows without needing to be tended, rocks are situated in geometric patterns, and identical cattle graze in unison. |
| 4 | A contingent of modrons is methodically deconstructing and reorganizing the zone, heedless of their effect on the other inhabitants. |

### Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams
Mortal creatures come into contact with Dal Quor when they dream (except for elves, kalashtar, and warforged, which don't dream). The outer fringes of the plane are shaped by the memories and experiences of dreamers. The dark core at the heart of the plane is shaped by the nightmare force known as the Dreaming Dark. The primary inhabitants of Dal Quor are the quori, enigmatic master manipulators that can inhabit the dreams of others.

Tens of thousands of years ago, the quori fought a bitter war with the giants of Xen'drik. The giants ended the war by severing the connection between Dal Quor and Eberron and disrupting the cycle of the planes. As a result, Dal Quor is always remote in relation to the Material Plane, and no manifest zones are tied to Dal Quor. The only way to reach Dal Quor from the Material Plane is through the psychic projection of dreaming, and the quori are forced to possess mortal hosts to work their will on Eberron.

### Dolurrh, the Realm of the Dead
When a mortal soul dies, it is drawn to Dolurrh, a place defined by despair and apathy. Over time, memories are leached out of these trapped spirits until only husks remain. Although this seems a bleak fate, most religions maintain that Dolurrh isn't the end of a soul's journey; it is a gateway to whatever lies beyond. They assert that what appears to be dissolution is the natural process of the soul moving to a higher plane of existence that mortals can never realize: joining with the Sovereigns, merging with the Silver Flame, or simply rejoining the cycle of life in a new form. That claim notwithstanding, Dolurrh is a gloomy plane filled with the lingering traces of the dead.

##### Dolurrh Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Bodies buried here reanimate in 1d4 days, possessed by restless spirits. These spirits might be malevolent or benign. |
| 2 | Any necromancy spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. |
| 3 | Spells and abilities that raise the dead have a 50 percent chance to bring back 1d4 angry spirits as well. These might be banshees, ghosts, shadows, specters, wraiths, or other incorporeal undead. |
| 4 | In order to cast a spell of 1st level or higher in the zone, the caster must succeed on a Constitution check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost. |

### Fernia, the Sea of Fire
This plane encompasses both the raw elemental power of fire and its versatility: flame used as a weapon, as a force that holds darkness at bay, or as a destroyer and a force for change. Fernia is home to all manner of fire elementals and to celestials and fiends that embrace the same ideals. Efreeti pashas and fiendish satraps rule city-islands of obsidian that drift atop seas of magma, their minions producing metalcraft of surpassing beauty and quality.

##### Fernia Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Spells that deal fire damage are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone deals fire damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. |
| 2 | Weapons and armor with unusual abilities can be forged here, though their enchantments are not always stable. |
| 3 | The area is dotted with pools of molten earth and fissures of scalding water, from which mephits and elementals emerge with regularity. |
| 4 | Motes of *continual flame* are spontaneously generated in this region, typically attached to some vegetation or minerals from the area. These flames persist even if they are removed from the region. |

### Irian, the Eternal Dawn
Irian is the plane of light and hope, the wellspring of positive energy which is the foundation of light, life, and love. The regions of Irian reflect the idea of beginnings and of resurgent life: fertile lands untouched by any tool, glittering crystal forests, and thriving homesteads and communities. Angels dwell in a grand city reflecting the first days of a glorious empire. The sun never sets here.

Positive energy flows into Eberron from Irian, and the denizens of Irian believe that the simple fact of their existence helps the mortals of the Material Plane. The celestials of Irian are also those most likely to respond to *planar ally* and similar spells.

##### Irian Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The waters of a spring hold curative powers—curing disease, healing wounds, even restoring lost senses. |
| 2 | Clusters of radiant crystals sprout from the earth. A spell of 1st level or higher cast within 30 feet of these crystals, if it restores hit points or deals radiant damage, is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. |
| 3 | A maple tree with translucent, violet-hued bark and shimmering leaves grows in the heart of a swamp. Creatures that live near it age very slowly. |
| 4 | Undead within the zone have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. |

### Kythri, the Churning Chaos
The plane of chaos and change, Kythri is a realm in constant flux. The elements collide in fantastic explosions of unbridled power, motes of earth careen erratically through space as gravity constantly shifts, and a riot of colors blazes through the ever-shifting sky. Still, stoic githzerai monks exert their will over the elements, crafting monasteries on islands of earth amid the chaos. Several varieties of slaadi dwell here as well, exulting in the endless turmoil.

##### Kythri Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The earth here is highly changeable and unstable. A creature that succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Nature) check as an action can alter a 20-by-20-foot square of terrain in some way. For example, they might choose to turn the earth to mud, cause stony spikes to erupt from the soil, or warp local plant life. Failing the check causes random, uncontrolled effects. |
| 2 | Fabulous formations of precariously balancing rocks dot these badlands. They randomly collapse, only to slowly reassemble over the course of days. |
| 3 | Packs of slaadi erupt from inside a local cave networks at random intervals, terrorizing travelers. |
| 4 | Any spell that deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder damage cast within the zone instead deals one of those damage types determined at random. |

### Lamannia, the Twilight Forest
Though it is referred to as a forest, Lamannia contains every possible natural environment. It is home to great beasts, lycanthropes, and other beings that reflect the power of nature. The splendor of nature in this place is intoxicating to druids. Animals born here are paragons of their species, infused with primal power that put even the finest specimens of House Vadalis to shame.

##### Lamannia Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Spells that summon elementals are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. |
| 2 | The forces of nature work to tear down anything built within the zone. Weather, vegetation, and a rapid rate of decay combine to quickly destroy structures built in the region and overgrow the ruins. |
| 3 | The zone is dominated by towering trees and thick undergrowth. Animals come from the surrounding area to live in the zone, where they grow larger and stronger than usual for their species. |
| 4 | What appears to be a circle of stones is in truth a group of slumbering earth elementals that came from Lamannia during its most recent coterminous period. |

### Mabar, the Endless Night
Mabar is the darkness that promises to swallow even the brightest day, the hungry shadow that yearns to consume light and life. It is the plane of entropy, hunger, and loss, slowly sucking the life from the multiverse. It is the source of negative energy in Eberron. Most undead are animated by the power of Mabar, and the life they drain from mortals flows into the Endless Night.

Mabar is made up of many fragments, each one representing a different vision of desolation. The fiends of Mabar scheme to steal fragments of other planes and draw them down into their eternal darkness, creating a jumble of broken worlds in varying states of decay.

##### Mabar Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Undead animated here have 2 extra hit points per Hit Die and make saving throws against being turned or frightened with advantage. |
| 2 | Vegetation here is sour and stunted, animals are stillborn or deformed, and a malaise hangs in the air. |
| 3 | On nights during the month of Sypheros, when the Shadow Moon is dominant in the sky, horrific monsters stalk the area, prompting residents to leave offerings outside their doors to ward off the evil. |
| 4 | The radius of any light source in the zone is halved, and saving throws against necromancy spells are made with disadvantage in the zone. |

### Risia, the Plain of Ice
The counterpoint to Fernia, Risia embodies winter's chill and the stoic constancy of the glacier. Across Risia's icy expanse, blizzards ceaselessly howl over floes of thick, blue ice, and frost giants carve great fortresses from glaciated mountains. Unprotected visitors perish quickly, but those who adapt to the cold or protect themselves from it can plumb the plane's frigid depths for ancient secrets.

##### Risia Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Spells that deal cold damage are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone deals cold damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. |
| 2 | Veins of cobalt-blue ice run through a glacier in the area. If extracted, this ice maintains its temperature and doesn't melt. An object carved from it can function as a spellcasting focus for spells dealing with water or ice. |
| 3 | Abominable yetis lair in a network of bitterly cold, frost-rimed caves in the mountains. |
| 4 | Any spell that deals fire damage deals just half the normal damage. |

### Shavarath, the Battleground
Shavarath is the plane of war, ravaged by a conflict that will never end. Since the dawn of time, armies of fiends and celestials have fought one another in Shavarath, their eternal battles a microcosm of the struggle between good and evil that rages across all of reality. New arrivals are subject to forced conscription when encountered (whether by angel, demon, or devil), if they aren't summarily dispatched. Amid the constant strife, windstorms of blades scour the landscape, capable of cutting the unprepared to ribbons. For all its danger, Shavarath holds weapons of legend and a wealth of knowledge on the art of war.

##### Shavarath Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Blades crafted here have a reputation for being especially fine and sharp. When a creature in the zone scores a critical hit with an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage, the attack deals one additional die of damage. |
| 2 | Blood spilled here never washes away. Any Charisma checks made in the zone to avoid hostility are made with disadvantage; Charisma checks made to encourage violence are always successful. |
| 3 | Storms of whirling blades cut the sky during times of combat, randomly attacking the participants. The effect is the same as that of the *cloud of daggers* spell, but the area and the damage might both increase. |
| 4 | Devils, demons, and angels duel in the remains of a ruined fortress that serves as a portal to Shavarath. |

### Syrania, the Azure Sky
Crystal spires float in a perfect blue sky. Farms and serene communities stretch across clouds. Syrania is the plane of peace and all that flourishes in times of peace. This includes commerce; the Immeasurable Market of Syrania draws merchants and travelers from across reality.

Syrania is home to a host of angels that devote their immortal lives to serene contemplation. Each angel seeks to achieve mastery of one pure concept, such as holding all the knowledge on a subject or ceaselessly abiding by the tenets of a virtue. An angel of dreams isn't a quori, but it understands dreams, it can explain and interpret them, and it can shape them if it chooses. Likewise, an angel of war isn't constantly embroiled in battle as the celestials of Shavarath are; instead, it seeks perfection in the art and theories of war. Angels of Syrania can be useful sources of information for adventurers, and sometimes travel to Eberron to observe mortals.

##### Syrania Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | This zone suppresses all aggressive thought. Any creature that wants to make an attack or cast a damaging spell must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it doesn't make the attack or cast the spell, but loses its action. |
| 2 | Those with great will and fortitude who ascend a mountain peak in this area can try to bend the weather for miles around to their will, as if they had cast the *control weather* spell. |
| 3 | In this sun-dappled field, children—as well as free-spirited, childlike folk—find themselves able to fly for 1 hour. |
| 4 | A village is built into the side of a cliff face here. Windmills protruding from the cliff collect energy from the power of the wind, which is used to operate elevators throughout the community. |

### Thelanis, the Faerie Court
Thelanis is the home of the fey and a realm where narrative and metaphor shape the nature of reality. Its many dominions are governed by the archfey, and the denizens of each realm reflect the nature and the story of their lord. For instance, the realm of the Prince of Frost is trapped in endless winter, and pale eladrin lead packs of winter wolves in their hunts. It's not the same environment as on Risia, because the prince's realm isn't an embodiment of the idea of cold—rather, it's a domain frozen by its prince's broken heart. If the prince's story were changed, the realm would change with it.

Time and space are both malleable in the Faerie Court, and a mortal who wanders into Thelanis might never return—or might leave after a few days to discover that weeks, months, or years have passed back home.

##### Thelanis Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Fey trees whose wood is imbued with magical properties grow here, along with a copse of guardian **treants** and awakened flora. |
| 2 | A circle of mushrooms serves as a portal to Thelanis when the proper offering is placed in its center. |
| 3 | An eladrin commune that holds powerful esoteric knowledge is nestled in the depths of a forest inhabited by large numbers of **pixies**. |
| 4 | The magic of the fey runs deep here. Saving throws against enchantment and illusion spells are made with disadvantage. |

### Xoriat, the Realm of Madness
Xoriat's bizarre geometry and unspeakable inhabitants seem like the product of an insane person's nightmare. In this utterly alien environment, beings whose appearance can shatter a person's sanity live in cities crafted from gargantuan, fleshy tumors. Seas of protoplasm, in a shade of purple that hurts the eyes, lap against shores of chitin. Some can look upon Xoriat and see it as a place of revelations, but most mortals who come too close to Xoriat fall prey to madness. Xoriat is the source of many aberrations, including the terrifying daelkyr.

##### Xoriat Manifest Zone Features
| d4 | Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Reality is frayed here. Casting any spell of 1st level or higher triggers a roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in chapter 3 of the *Player's Handbook*. |
| 2 | A character must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw at the end of each hour spent in this place. On a failed save, the character is afflicted with a random form of short-term madness (see *chapter 8* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). |
| 3 | Residents of a settlement here display bizarre mutations and unsettling behavior. Visitors who stay too long develop odd characteristics as well. |
| 4 | A cavern here is a cancerous tumor that issues forth aberrations to prey upon the world, and it is growing. |

## Eberron and the Multiverse
It is theoretically possible to travel between Eberron and other worlds in the multiverse by means of the Deep Ethereal or various spells designed for planar travel, but the cosmology of Eberron is specifically designed to prevent such travel, to keep the world hidden away from the meddling of gods, celestials, and fiends from beyond.

The three progenitor wyrms worked together to form Eberron and its planes as a new cosmic system in the depths of the Ethereal Plane. They recreated the elves, orcs, dragons, and other races found throughout the multiverse and placed them in their new world, but allowed them to develop beyond the reach of Gruumsh, Corellon, Lolth, and other influences for good and ill.

In your campaign, you might decide that the barrier formed by the Ring of Siberys is intact, and contact between Eberron and the worlds and planes beyond its cosmology is impossible. This is the default assumption of this book. On the other hand, you might want to incorporate elements from other realms. Perhaps you want to use a published adventure that involves Tiamat or the forces of the Abyss meddling in the affairs of the world. In such a case, it could be that the protection offered by the Ring of Siberys has begun to fail. You might link the weakening of Siberys to the Mourning—perhaps whatever magical catastrophe caused the Mourning also disrupted the Ring of Siberys, or perhaps a disruption of the Ring of Siberys actually caused the Mourning!

If contact between Eberron and the wider multiverse is recent and limited, consider the implications for everyone involved. In the Great Wheel, Asmodeus is an ancient threat, with well-established cults, lines of tieflings, and a long history of meddling that sages might uncover in dusty old tomes hidden in remote libraries. But if Asmodeus has only just discovered Eberron and begun to influence it for the first time, there is no lore about him to be discovered on Eberron. He has no power base and needs to recruit new followers. Unusual alliances might form against him, as celestials and fiends join forces to expel this hostile outsider.

## Gods, Celestials, and Fiends
The people of Eberron believe their gods are omnipresent—not bound to a single coherent form, but present in all places. If you revere the Silver Flame, its power is always with you. The Sovereign Onatar guides the hand of every smith who knows how to listen for his voice, and Dol Arrah and Dol Dorn are active on every battlefield, guiding every soldier. This outlook means that religion is driven by faith, as opposed to the concrete actions of deities. The faithful believe that their triumphs reflect the assistance of a divine influence. They don't expect a god to physically show up and solve their problems.

Fiends and celestials certainly do have physical form, however. Fortunately for the folk of the Material Plane, these extraplanar creatures are deeply invested in their own affairs and have little interest in Eberron. Demons and angels battle one another in Shavarath, but they've been doing this since before humanity existed, and they dare not leave their posts to fool around elsewhere. Exceptions do exist, such as the daelkyr and the Dreaming Dark, but by and large these natives of other planes are exclusively concerned with where they live. As such, player characters are more likely to encounter celestials and fiends that are native to Eberron, spawned by Khyber or Siberys, rather than extraplanar entities.

### Couatls
Couatls are a celestial race born from Siberys at the dawn of time. Along with the dragons, they battled the fiendish overlords of Khorvaire and Sarlona. Ultimately, the couatls sacrificed most of their number and combined their souls to form a prison to hold the overlords. Scholars have theorized that their combined souls eventually became the force that is worshiped by the Church of the Silver Flame. The church is ambivalent on the topic, preaching that regardless of how the Flame was first kindled, there is a place within the Flame for all noble souls.

The few couatls that remain on Eberron are devoted servants of the light. They are most often found guarding the prison of the ancient fiendish overlords, and individuals sometimes act directly to aid adventurers who fight the forces of darkness.

### Fiends
The mightiest of the fiends born from Khyber are creatures of immense power known as the overlords. Dozens of overlords were imprisoned by the Silver Flame at the dawn of time; two of them, **Rak Tulkhesh** and **Sul Khatesh**, are detailed in *chapter 6*. Another—Bel Shalor, the Shadow in the Flame—is bound within the Silver Flame itself in the great cathedral in Flamekeep in Thrane. You can adapt other evil gods or archfiends for an Eberron campaign (assuming you don't want Eberron to be connected to the wider multiverse) by recasting them as overlords. For example, Tiamat could be an overlord embodying the pride and potential for evil within dragons, Lolth could be an overlord who preys on the elves, and Asmodeus the insidious maker of profane bargains.

Any fiend—whether devil, demon, yugoloth, or something else—could be spawned by Khyber if it suits your story. Such fiends might be bound to an overlord, or they might be independent incarnations of evil unleashed on the world. Two other races of fiends, though, play important roles in its history.

#### Night Hags
Night hags have been around since the Age of Demons, when they often served as ambassadors and carried messages between the fiends and the dragons. Today, they remain impartial mediators, and adventurers who are about to deal with outsiders or other planes of existence might want to seek the advice of a night hag—although one can be quite difficult to find.

#### Rakshasas
As the primary agents of the fiendish overlords, rakshasas once dominated Khorvaire and Sarlona. When the overlords were defeated in the first age of the world by the combined might of the dragons and the couatls, the rakshasas largely disappeared into Khyber as well. The Lords of Dust are made up largely of rakshasas, scheming in the shadows—many trying to free their imprisoned overlords, others looking for a way to claim their masters' power for their own.

## Travel
Thanks to the industrious innovation of multiple dragonmarked houses and workshops full of magewrights, the people of Khorvaire can cross the continent in a week or less using magical means. The lightning rail and vessels powered by bound elementals and operated by the dragonmarked houses, can carry passengers as far in an hour as a horse can walk in a day. This section discusses issues related to travel in an Eberron campaign and presents the Gold Dragon Inns, a chain of hotels that offer consistent accommodation for travelers anywhere in Khorvaire.

As described in *chapter 5* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, it's up to you whether you gloss over travel in your campaign or narrate it in more detail. If the point is to get the characters to their destination so they can get the adventure underway, it's fine to assume that their journey (whether it's by lightning rail, airship, or more mundane means) passes without incident. After all, the people of Khorvaire make such trips every day, and most of them reach their destinations safely.

The alternative is to make the journey an important part of the adventure. Travel can play a crucial role in a story, and when it does, you should give it as much time at the game table as it needs.

### Elemental Vessels
Long ago, gnome artificers and specialists from House Cannith discovered and developed a means of magical travel. The heart of the process is a set of techniques for binding elementals that uses Khyber dragonshards. This closely guarded procedure requires delicate engineering, arcane skill, and rare materials from around the world, and different workshops employ varying esoteric techniques. Building a new vehicle can occupy a workshop for months while magical energy is painstakingly inlaid into the vessel's hull. Such work is a complicated task requiring the labor of many; it is not something that can be undertaken by a lone wizard for any amount of compensation.

The construction of elemental vessels requires the use of two kinds of dragonshards. A Khyber dragonshard of the largest size and finest quality is required to bind the elemental to the vessel, and a Siberys dragonshard is needed to craft the vehicle's helm. Production of new vessels grinds to a halt without a steady supply of both kinds of dragonshards, and a workshop with an order to fill will pay a handsome fee to adventurers who can find them.

#### Elemental Matrix
Every elemental vessel is imbued with an invisible, arcane matrix. This magical essence extends from the containment chamber at the core of the vehicle to the binding struts, then through the rest of the vehicle's hull. When a Khyber dragonshard holding a bound elemental is placed in the containment chamber, the matrix comes alive. The unsuppressed elemental emerges from the shard and flows along the matrix in the way that blood moves through the arteries and veins of a living creature.

The binding struts force the elemental into a ring shape and give every elemental vessel its distinctive appearance. From there, the elemental continues to flow along the matrix through the hull, appearing as jagged, snaking lines of living energy that pulse and shift. These conduits of elemental energy take on an appearance associated with the type of elemental bound into the vessel. A fire elemental, for example, sends tendrils of flame along the hull of its ship.

At the command of the vehicle's dragonmarked pilot, the bound elemental can be suppressed, causing its essence to flow back into the containment chamber and the matrix to disappear from view. A vehicle whose elemental is suppressed ceases to be propelled.

#### Controlling the Elemental
Piloting an elemental vessel requires effective communication between the pilot and the bound elemental. The elemental controls the vehicle's movement, and everything from basic propulsion to delicate maneuvering is dependent on the ability of the pilot to control the elemental. If the elemental is uncontrolled and not suppressed, the vehicle moves according to the elemental's whim until a pilot asserts control again.

A dragonmarked heir at the helm of a vessel can command the elemental easily. Without such a pilot, it's very difficult to control the vessel. A character who is touching either the Khyber dragonshard where the bound elemental is housed or the magic item at the vessel's helm can try to communicate with the elemental, but with no guarantee of success.

A character can make a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check to persuade the elemental to cooperate or demand its obedience. On a successful check, the elemental obeys the character for 1 minute.

The *dominate monster* spell can also enable a character without a dragonmark to control an elemental vessel, even wresting control away from a dragonmarked pilot. The *charm monster* spell (found in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*) also makes the elemental compliant to the caster's wishes, but the elemental remains obedient to the commands of a dragonmarked pilot at the helm.

#### Freeing the Elemental
Shattering the Khyber dragonshard that binds it can free an elemental, preventing the vehicle from moving. On most elemental vessels, the shard is sealed in a protective metal chest with 10 (3d6) hit points, usually made of iron (AC 19) but sometimes of mithral (AC 21) or adamantine (AC 23). The chest is often guarded with a *glyph of warding* and housed in a room behind locked and possibly trapped doors. The shard itself has AC 17 and 10 (3d6) hit points.

### Lyrandar Airship
The airship is the most advanced elemental-powered vehicle on Eberron, the pride of House Lyrandar and the forerunner of the magical advances that many hope will become commonplace in the aftermath of the Last War. The first airships emerged from the Cannith and Zilargo workshops and appeared in House Lyrandar's service just eight years ago (in 990 YK). For now, though, they remain rare, because the soarwood required for their construction is exceedingly scarce and tightly controlled.

Soarwood is a form of buoyant timber found only on the island of Aerenal, and the elves who live there limit their annual harvest of the precious wood. As a result, production of new airships proceeds at a snail's pace, unable to satisfy the fervent demand for new vessels. The discovery of a new supply of soarwood could literally change the world, and even convincing the elves of Aerenal to part with more of it would be an achievement worth a handsome reward from House Lyrandar.

#### How It Works
A standard airship (at least as far as standards have been defined for this relatively new creation) looks similar to an oceangoing ship but is rigged with control fins and rudders rather than sails. An air or fire elemental is bound into a ring around the hull, which is suspended on four struts jutting outward. Most airships are outfitted with the finest amenities, including many decorative flourishes and creature comforts.

***Operation.*** A dragonmarked heir of House Lyrandar must pilot a Lyrandar airship, channeling the power of the Mark of Storm through the *wheel of wind and water* that controls the vessel. The helm is typically situated near the rear of the ship, inside the shelter of a wheelhouse. Controlling the vessel (without the benefit of something like the *conductor stones* that dictate a lightning rail route) requires constant attention, so at least two pilots typically travel on every journey.

Only a dragonmark heir with the Mark of Storm can use the wheel and command the bound elemental. House Lyrandar pilots train for months to gain a deep understanding of the ship's powers and limitations. Because of this training, a skilled pilot can execute acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.

Airships can move in all three dimensions, with or without the aid of the wind. Unlike most flying creatures, they don't rely on wings for lift thanks to their soarwood hulls. They are able to fly equally well on their sides or even upside down (notwithstanding the risks that such maneuvers present to passengers and crew).

Airships cannot actually land, because the struts that hold the elemental ring in place protrude 10 feet from the bottom of the vessel. Thus, passengers and cargo are lifted in elevators and loaded at towers in major cities. Each ship carries rope ladders for use at smaller stations, in open terrain, or in cases of dire emergency.

A typical airship can reach a speed of 20 miles per hour in clear skies carrying up to 30 tons of cargo. Airships are most often employed by explorers and by wealthy travelers who demand luxury—clients who have a need to move quickly to places that might not be served by the lightning rail.

***Suppression.*** Although the elemental bound to the airship is essential for propulsion, the vessel's soarwood hull provides its lighter-than-air buoyancy. When the elemental is suppressed, the ship remains aloft but can't move. The pilot always suppresses the elemental before docking, then uses ropes to maneuver the vessel into position.

### Lyrandar Galleons
A House Lyrandar galleon, also called an elemental galleon, resembles a Lyrandar airship except that it has a water elemental ring that propels it across oceans and seas instead of through the air. This vessel has a speed of 10 miles per hour but otherwise is similar to a Lyrandar airship.

### Orien Lightning Rail
The wondrous lightning rail system once linked the far reaches of the Kingdom of Galifar, prior to the Last War. Now the system is divided, split into eastern and western circuits. Reestablishing the *conductor stone* paths across Scions Sound and the Mournland is often discussed in the halls of power in the Five Nations, but formidable challenges are involved.

#### How It Works
A lightning rail train is made up of an elemental vessel linked to a series of connected carts, all of which float about 5 feet off the ground. Each cart, similar in form to a large wagon with no wheels, has a *conductor stone* embedded in its underside. A corresponding set of *conductor stones* laid out in a line on the ground interacts with the stones in the carts to form a rail for the train to follow. Lightning arcs between the two sets of stones, accounting for the system's name.

The elemental vessel at the front of the train, called a crew cart, holds a bound air elemental that propels the train along its route at a speed of about 30 miles per hour. The elemental appears as a ring of lightning encircling the crew cart while the train is in motion. A bound air elemental can move a train of up to ten carts without obvious strain, and most trains are configured accordingly.

The other carts that make up the train have various purposes. A typical train has a crew cart at each end, with two cargo carts, four passenger carts, and two lounge carts in between. Doors at both ends of each cart enable crew and passengers to walk from one to the next, even while the train is in motion. Both crew carts are identical, except that the bound elemental in one is suppressed. On the return trip, the roles of the carts and the states of their elementals are reversed.

Specialized carts of other sorts vary in configuration depending on their purpose and the degree of luxury afforded to them. Some have solid sides and roofs, while others are covered only with canvas.

Map 4.10 shows the different carts that comprise most lightning rail trains.

***Operation.*** The vessel's pilot, a House Orien dragonmarked heir, stands at the helm, high atop the crew cart, beneath the elemental binding struts. The pilot controls the elemental and communicates with it during the trip, watching the path ahead through broad windows that encircle the helm platform.

The placement of *conductor stone* lines dictates where a lightning rail train can travel, but the pilot still must make operational decisions as the coach moves from one city to the next. The pilot controls the vessel's speed based on conditions around the train. When *conductor stone* lines split, as they do at various hubs along the way, the pilot selects the intended route and directs the elemental down the correct line.

The crew of a train includes handful of chief stewards overseeing a number of lesser stewards who are charged with seeing to the needs of passengers and keeping cargo secured.

![[133-map410_lightningrailcars-player.jpg|right|300]]((Player Version))
#### Lightning Rail Stations
Lightning rail stations, where passengers and cargo can be disembarked or loaded, are located in or just outside villages, towns, and cities along the conductor stone paths. There are no stations in the expanses between these settlements, and House Orien rules prohibit lightning rail pilots from stopping anywhere but at a station.

Stations throughout Khorvaire have a similar look and feel, to ensure that each one lives up to the high expectations of House Orien's patrons. White and gold *everbright lanterns* continually illuminate each station. When a train pulls into the station, loading ramps are moved into position beside each cargo cart, and stairs by each passenger cart. The cargo is unloaded from one side of the train and the passengers from the other.

Individual stations do have distinct touches that reflect local features. For example, the station in Gatherhold, in the Talenta Plains, is decorated with traditional halfling motifs and offers specialized stables for travelers leaving their dinosaurs behind. On a larger scale, the station at Passage, which is the seat of power for House Orien, is a multistoried structure designed as a monument to the majesty and storied history of the house.

### Mysterious Passengers
Lightning rails and airships are good places to encounter a broad sample of Khorvaire's diverse population. You can use the Mysterious Passengers table to bring curious characters in contact with an adventuring party on any kind of journey. Each of these characters might spark an entire new adventure, or might be little more than a momentary diversion. Determine details about these travelers are, and the stories behind them, as you see fit.

### Gold Dragon Inns
Travelers and explorers making their way across Khorvaire, especially in out-of-the-way areas, often find themselves in need of a safe place to spend the night. Thanks to the efforts of House Ghallanda, there's no better place to take a rest than at one of the hundreds of Gold Dragon Inns that the house operates.

Every city, most towns, and even some villages have a Gold Dragon Inn, and a large city might boast several. Every major road through the countryside has Gold Dragon Inns along much of its length, spaced roughly a day's travel apart. Sometimes an inn is the nucleus of a small community whose industry is focused on providing for the needs of travelers. A few Gold Dragon Inns are found in locations that offer no other comforts for the weary traveler—for example, high in a pass through the Byeshk Mountains, deep in the Karrnwood, or beneath the surface of the Mror Holds.

#### Inn Features and Amenities
Every Gold Dragon Inn provides a standard menu of reliable services at reasonable rates. Prices are fixed (equal to those given in *chapter 5* of the *Player's Handbook*), and the quality of services is reliably modest, with some comfortable upgrades available. Every inn uses one of a small number of possible floor plans, and every inn's restaurant offers the same menu.

The size and number of guest rooms can vary from inn to inn: a small roadside inn has four rooms and a moderately sized common room, while a thriving inn in a large city has forty rooms, a restaurant, and a separate common room, with two stages for entertainment. Because the inns are owned by House Ghallanda, the buildings all include accommodations for halfling-sized guests as well as taller folk.

Because travelers often carry valuables with them, each inn has a heavy strongbox secured with an *arcane lock* spell. To make a traveler's stay more enjoyable, perhaps even memorable, House Ghallanda has arranged with House Thuranni and House Phiarlan to employ guild-licensed entertainers at almost every Gold Dragon Inn.

To populate an inn with some distinctive individuals, you can use the *Mysterious Passengers table*.

#### Inn Attractions
The Inn Attractions table offers some ideas for unique twists on an inn's character or atmosphere.

##### Inn Attractions
| d6 | Attraction |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The bartender is a changeling who is always mimicking the patrons for a laugh. |
| 2 | The innkeeper is 7 feet tall, claiming to have grown 2 feet after venturing into the mist of the Mournland. |
| 3 | Rumor has it that the innkeeper here is a gold dragon cloaked in a humanoid guise. |
| 4 | This inn is haunted by a ghost who loves to sit by the fireplace and tell stories—but it has been accused of more sinister activities once the fire burns down to embers and the guests are in their beds. |
| 5 | The inn has a **blink dog** that wanders around with her five pups, all of them eager for attention and treats. |
| 6 | This inn offers "the true Talenta experience"—the halfling family that runs it keeps pet dinosaurs. |

# Chapter 4: Building Eberron Adventures - Sharn

## Adventures in Sharn
Chapter 3 describes the city of Sharn in detail; the following sections focus on the adventures that can happen there. These adventures can unfold among the tallest towers of Skyway, in the deepest depths of the Cogs, or anywhere in between. At the end of this chapter is an introductory adventure, "*Forgotten Relics*," set in Sharn.

Sharn can be a grim place that makes good people bad and bad people worse. In its mean streets, gritty detectives contend with corrupt law officers while trying to foil the efforts of merciless gangs and monstrous thugs. In the highest towers, wealthy barons from the dragonmarked houses make shady deals with crime bosses, each of them making profits by exploiting both the ordinary folk and the well-heeled upper crust alike. Corruption can be found among the ranks of government, the watch, the temples, and large businesses. This atmosphere makes Sharn a perfect location for adventures inspired by the noir genre.

Sharn can also be a place of unrelenting action, ranging from soarsleds speeding between the towertops to confrontations in the dungeon depths far beneath the city's lowest tier. Fallen angels, sinister shapeshifters, and monstrous mercenaries do battle with heroes from all walks of life, while unscrupulous collectors and smugglers carry on a brisk trade in artifacts brought back from the cyclopean ruins of Xen'drik. All these factors make Sharn an equally ideal location for adventures inspired by pulp action.

You can use the Life in the City table to generate ideas for adventures set in Sharn.

##### Life in the City
| d6 | Adventure Seed |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A homicidal changeling has killed two members of different dragonmarked houses, and doesn't plan to stop until one heir from each of the dragonmarked houses is dead. |
| 2 | A jeweled statuette has fallen into the hands of House Tarkanan, and a powerful member of the Aurum will stop at nothing to obtain it. The statuette's real worth lies in the secret plans hidden inside it. |
| 3 | A Karrnathi undead soldier troubled by sporadic memories of his former life is trying to locate his wife and family, who have fled Karrnath and now live somewhere in the lower districts of Sharn. |
| 4 | A shifter shopkeeper in Lower Northedge is being harassed by ruffians who believe that she and her family are lycanthropes. |
| 5 | A dragonmarked baron is found dead in her Upper Central mansion, seemingly a victim of some sort of ritual slaying. Outside help is needed to solve this delicate matter. |
| 6 | A **radiant idol** (see *chapter 6*) has formed a cult that attracts professors and staff of Morgrave University, promising them knowledge beyond imagining in exchange for their worship. |

### Home, Sweet Home
If you're creating a campaign based in Sharn, it's a good idea to establish a location that serves as a home base for the adventurers. You can use the Home Base table as a source of inspiration, or you can develop a unique location.

Work with the players to develop the connections that each character has to the site. If the location is a tavern, for instance, a bard character might perform there two nights a week. A fighter could be a regular who has a drink named after them. A ranger could be the undefeated champion of the local darts league. If the players enjoy this creative exercise, you could also allow each player to add a physical detail to the place or to describe one of the location's NPCs—the stuffed gorgon head over the hearth, another regular among the customers, and so on. This is a way to make this location truly feel like home, and to give each player a personal investment in it. This location becomes an automatic starting point for adventures, the place where the adventurers will meet with patrons and conduct business.

The Home Base table can also be useful to determine the venue if a patron wants to set up a meeting at a neutral location.

### The Streets of Sharn
The Street Events tables starting with "*Lower Sharn Street Events*" are filled with random events the characters can witness while they wander around Sharn. You can expand on an entry to make it the start of an encounter or adventure, though not every event needs to draw the characters into a longer story. Each table is meant to be used on a different level of Sharn: the lower wards, middle wards, upper wards, and Skyway. You can choose results from the tables, or randomly determine what happens, and you can modify results as you please, tailoring the details of an event to be a better fit for a particular district. The events on the tables are phrased so they can be read aloud or summarized to players.

#### What Happens Next?
After the adventurers witness an event on the streets of Sharn, what happens next depends largely on what they do. Maybe they avert their eyes and keep walking, as many residents of Sharn have trained themselves to do. Maybe they rush to get involved, or poke around delicately to learn more. An event like one of these doesn't have to be the start of an adventure, but it can be—particularly if it really catches your players' imagination.

When the players decide to learn more, it's up to you to figure out what they can discover. Ask yourself these questions:

- How did the people involved in this event get to this place? What were they doing earlier today? Where were they going when this event happened?
- Why isn't anyone else getting involved? What is complicating this situation?
- What do the people involved hope is going to happen next? What are they afraid might happen next? How are the circumstances changed because the characters have witnessed the event?

##### Home Base
| d12 | Location |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The Drunken Dragon (Clifftop, Upper Dura) is a tavern frequented by members of the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. It has a wide selection of spirits, and its walls are covered with adventuring trophies. The owner, a middle-aged halfling named Hascal d'Ghallanda, is a former adventurer who lost an eye and a leg in Xen'drik; he always has a story to share. |
| 2 | The Anvil (Callestan, Lower Dura) was one of the first Ghallanda halls in Sharn. Its glory days are long past, but the young innkeeper, Eranna d'Ghallanda, is determined to keep it alive. The Anvil is frequented by members of the Boromar Clan and is a good choice if one of the player characters has ties to this group. |
| 3 | The Dezina Museum of Antiquities (University, Upper Menthis) is attached to the library of Morgrave University. The museum has a remarkable collection of relics, but it's always looking for more. The curator is an elf named Emeron Sennared. He might be a personal friend or former teacher of one of the adventurers, or simply one who indulges their enthusiasm for antiquities and exotic locations. |
| 4 | Coldflame Keep (High Hope, Middle Northedge) is a garrison church dedicated to the Silver Flame. Once it supported a troop of templars, but it was largely abandoned during the war and now maintains a minimal staff. The priest, Mazin Tana, is a faithful servant of the Silver Flame and will provide modest food and lodging to adventurers who are trying to make the city a better place. |
| 5 | The Red Hammer (Blackbones, the Cogs) caters to warforged. It is run by two warforged, the envoy Blue and a juggernaut named Crucible. Although this place is a haven for warforged, other humanoids are allowed inside if their warforged allies vouch for them. |
| 6 | A Gold Dragon Inn (described earlier in this chapter) operated by House Ghallanda and located in almost any part of Sharn. |
| 7 | The district of Fallen (Lower Dura) was abandoned after a floating tower fell on it. The adventurers might have taken over an old temple or tavern on the edge of the district. |
| 8 | An abandoned bell tower, which could be anywhere in the city. The spells that drove the massive mechanism failed long ago. |
| 9 | An abandoned library, damaged during the war or thought to be cursed or haunted. |
| 10 | A shuttered tavern, which is a failed business tied to the family of one of the adventurers. |
| 11 | If one of the adventurers is a noble, the characters' base of operations is in the basement of the family estate or a tower apartment owned (but not currently used) by a dotty old aunt. |
| 12 | A ramshackle skycoach tethered to a condemned tower on the edge of the city. |

##### Lower Sharn Street Events
| d100 | Event |
|:---:|---|
| 01–02 | A **minotaur** holding a large piece of wood that could serve as a maul approaches you and politely asks if you have any copper to spare. |
| 03–04 | Down a nearby alleyway, a dwarf punches a **goblin** in the stomach, then walks away laughing. |
| 05–08 | A thin human child has been following you, but never gets too close. She keeps coughing, and you can see red marks on her neck that might be an aberrant dragonmark. |
| 09–10 | A human **priest** of Boldrei wheels a cart of bread loaves through the city, giving food to the homeless. |
| 11–15 | A **goblin** pushing a cart of rusty weapons and broken clay pots calls out, "Real artifacts of ancient Dhakaan for sale! Recovered from the ruins below!" |
| 16–18 | A man dressed in the livery of House Vadalis descends a tower wall mounted on the back of a **giant spider**. He shouts, "Need a ride? No faster way to get to the middle and upper wards! Reasonable rates!" |
| 19–22 | An **ogre** eating several rats on a skewer spits out a rodent skull at your feet. |
| 23–26 | A playful stray **mastiff** wags its tail as it approaches, drops a very large egg at your feet, and looks up expectantly. |
| 27–30 | A small, jovial crowd gathers around a **goblin** and a **kobold** that are getting ready to have an arm wrestling match. A dwarf calls for the crowd to place their bets. |
| 31–34 | Three **harpies** fly through the streets singing a jolly drinking song. Each carries a bucket around her neck, and passersby occasionally drop coins in one. |
| 35–38 | A human woman and a warforged with a silvered body are walking down the street together. They're too well dressed for this district, and are looking around as if lost. |
| 39–42 | A Khoravar half-elf in the robes of an oracle approaches and promises to give you the answer to all of life's problems for 42 copper crowns. |
| 43–44 | A human and an elf kiss passionately in an alley near your path. They notice you and quickly move apart. |
| 45–46 | Three shifter children run by you, yelling and chasing each other with wooden swords. They duck into a boarded-up building. |
| 47–48 | "Stop her! She stole my necklace!" a priest of the Sovereign Host cries, pointing to a grimy halfling clutching a silver chain and climbing up the side of a tower. |
| 49–50 | A young woman using a crutch and missing a leg approaches, asking if you can spare any coin to help a Brelish veteran of the Last War. |
| 51–52 | Cries of alarm fill the street as a wooden crate from somewhere above crashes down into the lower city. |
| 53–56 | A splash of unidentified, putrid liquid falls from above, soaking you. |
| 57–60 | The generally unpleasant smell of the lower wards is pierced by the scent of something delicious being baked nearby. |

| 87–90 | A member of the Sharn Watch looks uncomfortable as she wanders the street. It's clear she doesn't come down here often. |
| 91–92 | Two humans run into an alley, drawing daggers as they go. |
| 93–94 | Two drunken humans exit a tavern singing a Karrnathi battle hymn. Another human shouts at them to "shut up or get shut up." The drunken pair sings louder in response. |
| 95–96 | Two children reeking of sewage argue over who gets to wear a shiny helmet that sits on the ground between them. |
| 97–00 | You find a pamphlet on the ground advertising the Silvermist Theater. Someone has scrawled on it, "The real party is in the basement." |

##### Upper Sharn Street Events

| 7 | A **magewright** offers to use a simple charm to polish the coins in your purse for just 3 copper crowns. "We wouldn't want anyone here to get grime on their gloves from handling those filthy coins of yours from the lower wards." |
| 8 | A tour group pauses to marvel at a mansion. |
| 9 | A large statue commemorates Lord Dalian ir'Tain, a noble philanthropist lost at sea at the end of the Last War. He holds a spyglass in one hand and a miniature dragon turtle in the other. |
| 10 | A warforged with roses twined around her limbs offers to sell you a bouquet for five silver sovereigns. |
| 11 | It starts to drizzle. A well-dressed half-elf glares at the sky and snaps his fingers. The rain immediately stops. |
| 12 | A member of the Sharn Watch stops you. "Can I help you? Are you sure you're in the right ward?" |

### Sharn Heights
Sharn heights are intersections of bridges and platforms in Sharn that make the perfect place for a meeting, theft, or assassination. The crisscrossing paths of Sharn heights allow criminals to come and go in different directions, looking like normal passersby as they trade information, cut purses, or throw people to their dooms.

#### Sharn Heights Features
Map 4.11 shows a typical Sharn location that contains intersections of bridges and platforms. Each bridge is 20 feet higher (on average) than the one immediately below it.

The bridges are connected to businesses and residences. The residences are usually locked, while most shops lock up at night. The taverns and gambling dens are open for business all day and well into the night. One of the bridges connects to a skycoach parking station, which houses several of those vehicles. Other bridges lead to an elevator, garden overlooks, and staircases that take pedestrians farther up and down into the city.

#### Sharn Heights Adventures
Adventures in Sharn heights are perfect for pulp action scenes. Narrow bridges, moving platforms, and great heights come together in a public place that's a perfect location for swashbuckling battles, tense hostage negotiations, and over-the-top heists. The Sharn Heights Adventures table offers reasons why your characters might need to visit such a location. In addition, the characters could meet with a Boromar Clan or House Tarkanan patron in Sharn heights.

##### Sharn Heights Adventures
| d4 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Pose as House Tarkanan operatives to capture a wanted criminal with an aberrant dragonmark. The criminal is waiting on a bridge for his House Tarkanan escort to arrive. |
| 2 | Obtain a satchel of evidence obtained by a goblin who has infiltrated Daask. The goblin, who is working with the Boromar Clan or the Sharn Watch to take down key Daask operatives, is waiting on a bridge. |
| 3 | Break into a building connected to Sharn heights to steal something valuable. |
| 4 | Stop a crooked Sharn Watch official who is trying to reach a skycoach and flee the city to escape arrest. |

## Crime in Sharn
Crime is part of everyday life in Sharn, and just as in any other city, sometimes such acts are carried out by people who have no ties to organized crime. An upstanding citizen could be driven to murder by passion. A refugee could become a cutpurse out of desperation. The rowdy Brelish veterans who call themselves the Brokenbridge Brawlers don't think of themselves as criminals, and they have no connection to any larger organization.

Any professional criminal in Sharn, however, is likely to be affiliated with one of four organizations. The Boromar Clan is the most entrenched and widespread of the four, and has dominated the business of crime in Sharn for centuries. The group called Daask is on the rise, directly challenging the Boromars. The Tyrants and House Tarkanan are smaller organizations with more specialized areas of operation. These groups are summarized in the Criminal Organizations of Sharn table and described in the later sections that follow.

Each of these organizations has a core of operatives and enterprises under the direct control of its leaders. But each also has a network of secondary relationships.

For example, the Little Fingers are a group of pickpockets and cutpurses that work in the Bazaar of Middle Dura. They aren't directly tied to the Boromar family. But the master of the gang pays a tithe to the Boromars, and if the Boromars send word to them that certain targets are to be avoided, the Little Fingers do so. In return, the Boromars ensure that the Sharn Watch in Middle Dura largely leaves the Fingers alone. So although the Boromar Clan itself has a few hundred members, it has interaction with thousands of criminals throughout the city.

*Chapter 3* provides an overview of the four major criminal organizations and a body of information about them that's more or less common knowledge in Sharn. This section explores the roles that each one could play in a Sharn-based campaign.

Although the powerful organizations in Sharn have a hand in most criminal activity, sometimes you might want an adventure to involve a smaller gang. The Street Gangs table presents a number of lesser criminal groups adventurers could tangle with.

> ##### Narcotics in Sharn
>From the owners of incense-clouded dens to fast-talking street dealers, many entrepreneurs—legitimate and otherwise—make a profitable business selling narcotics in Sharn. The following drugs are just two of the most notorious substances available in the City of Towers and beyond.
>
>**Dragon's Blood**. Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon's blood is a potent and highly addictive stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug's effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn't something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a *fireball* in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon's blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the Wild Magic Surge table in the *Player's Handbook*.
>
>**Dreamlily**. A psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage, essence of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to help manage pain during the Last War, it's now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily isn't illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it's heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration or the price might vary accordingly.

| The Red Jackals | Primarily shifters and half-orcs who live in the sewers below Menthis and clash with anyone who invades their territory |

## The Boromar Clan
The most powerful criminal organization in Sharn started as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Operating out of its headquarters and key holdings in the Little Plains district of Middle Menthis, the Boromar Clan controls gambling, smuggling, and theft in Sharn. Most of the city's burglars, pickpockets, and fences either work for or pay tithes to the organization. The Boromar Clan's network of extortion, bribery, and blackmail extends from Lower Dura to Skyway.

![[137-4-10.png|right|300]](Clawfoot Dinosaur)

The Boromars' influence extends beyond criminal enterprises into many legitimate circles of power. Ilyra Boromar sits on the city council, and a number of other councilors are close allies of the clan. The family has ties by marriage to House Jorasco. A Boromar attends every Skyway party. The family owns tenements throughout Sharn and invests in shipping, storing both legal goods and contraband in many of the warehouses in Precarious and Cogsgate. In many districts, local officials and Sharn Watch officers have been taking bribes from the Boromars for generations.

The criminal nature of the Boromar Clan is an open secret, and in some districts the Boromars are seen as hometown heroes. They are immigrants who've made good, common people who've risen to rival the barons and kings. They give the people what they want, whether it's untaxed gambling, cheap spirits, or dreamlily. The clan operates with a degree of impunity because its operatives adhere to an unspoken rule: whenever possible, criminal acts against individuals should target tourists and travelers. Boromar pickpockets don't prey on the people they see every day. Instead, they seek out the many strangers who move around the city all the time. The Watch officer who turns a blind eye to a pickpocket thus feels justified, since it's not the citizens of Sharn that are victimized.

Boromar's longstanding status at the head of Sharn's criminal enterprises has recently come under challenge. After nearly a decade of slow growth, the Droaamish mob known as Daask has recently started targeting Boromar holdings. The halfling clan hasn't faced such a serious threat before, and it's scrambling to figure out how to deal with Daask's guerrilla tactics.

### Boromar Operations
The Boromar Clan has a hand in all types of crime in Sharn. Most Boromar leaders despise unnecessary violence, but the clan has a host of enforcers and a handful of capable assassins. The clan's web of extortion is so thoroughly woven into society that many residents simply consider it another form of tax. Boromar specializes in three fields of activity: gambling, smuggling, and thievery.

Gambling isn't illegal in Sharn, but all legal games are taxed by the Brelish crown and are required to follow regulations that spoil the experience for many. Boromar's operations are cheaper to participate in and offer the lure of greater profits.

Smuggling has become an increasingly important business since the Last War disrupted many traditional lines of trade. The clan's primary import is the narcotic called dreamlily. But the Boromars traffic in a wide range of goods, from arcane and alchemical weapons to foreign luxury items that have been made scarce by embargoes and sanctions. Under Boranel's law, it's forbidden to sell Aundairian wine in Breland, so if you want the good stuff, you'll need to work with the Boromars.

Boromar-sanctioned acts of thievery include the activities of the ubiquitous pickpockets that can be found across the city as well as the well-planned jobs of professional burglars. As mentioned earlier, Boromar thieves focus their attention on visitors to Sharn, thus avoiding friction with local law enforcement. When appropriate, stolen goods are transported out of the city by the fences and porters that drive the clan's smuggling operations.

### Boromar Clan NPCs
The Boromar Clan employs people of all races, but most of the organization and nearly all of its inner circle are made up of halflings. Some of the organization's most important people are these:

- Saidan Boromar is the current patriarch of the family. He grew up in Lower Dura and worked as a thief and assassin there before taking over the organization.
- Mala Boromar d'Jorasco is an heir of House Jorasco and the Boromar family matriarch. Her position in the family ensures that important members of the Boromar Clan receive Jorasco healing services at no cost to them; Saidan reimburses Jorasco from the clan's treasury.
- Councilor Ilyra Boromar is the eldest daughter of Mala and Saidan and a member of the city council. The Boromars' enemies on the council have grown bolder in the face of increased Daask attacks against the clan, and some of Ilyra's influence has eroded as a result.
- Halak Boromar is the family's chief enforcer. A recent immigrant from the Talenta Plains, Halak leads the Clawfoots, the Boromars' personal guard, and is an accomplished warrior.
- Ilsa Boromar is the family's leader in Callestan. She is ruthless in protecting her family's interests.
- Castar, a gnome, is the lone non-halfling in the Boromars' inner circle. He serves as Saidan's chief advisor and the organization's intelligence expert. The family looks to Castar to come up with a plan to defeat Daask, but so far none of his ideas have worked.

### Shady Nightclub
The Boromars control gambling dens and nightclubs throughout Sharn. The finer establishments are places for the Boromar Clan to wine, dine, bribe, and extort the city's powerful elite. At the other end of the spectrum, the run-down gambling halls and dreamlily dens in the poorer districts are places where those in the employ of the Boromars plan heists, store smuggled goods, hide bodies and wanted criminals, interrogate Daask spies, make good on threats, and unwind.

These places are public and expertly run by the city's most powerful criminals, so an openly violent approach to problem-solving in such a spot is likely to end in tragedy for the characters. When combat does occur in one of these nightclubs, it's usually because the instigators have brought enough strength of arms to take on the Boromars.

#### Shady Nightclub Features
The nightclub shown on map 4.12 could be tied to the Boromar Clan, or it could be any Sharn nightclub you need it to be. Made to accommodate customers from halflings to ogres, the club's double doorways are 10 feet wide, and its ceilings are 15 feet tall. Hooks, shelves, handrails, and furniture are provided at three different levels and sizes.

The nightclub has three entrances. Two are connected to the outside: a main entrance guarded by a bouncer and a back door that is locked from inside. Another locked entrance is connected to a stair that leads up and down to other levels in the nightclub's tower.

The club's main entrance opens into an entry vestibule. The attached cloakroom has a hidden door that leads to a secret room where criminal meetings and illegal activities take place.

The casino floor in the nightclub has tables running games of chance, a bar, and a raised stage. Bathrooms, a kitchen, and private rooms for high-roller games (and more criminal meetings and illegal activities) are accessible from the casino floor.

Boromar's security and management offices are connected by a hallway to the casino floor, the secret meeting room, and a second secret area used to store illegal contraband or captives. Occupants of both offices can see into these attached areas by way of magic one-way mirrors.

#### Shady Nightclub Adventures
The Shady Nightclub Adventures table offers reasons for the characters to enter one of these dangerous places. If the characters have a Boromar patron, that NPC could use a shady nightclub as a base of operations.

##### Shady Nightclub Adventures
| d6 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Get accepted into a private high-stakes card game, and try to win the grand prize. |
| 2 | Find out which Sharn Watch captain has a private meeting with a Boromar fence, and steal whatever the captain is buying. |
| 3 | Track down a missing noble hunted by assassins. |
| 4 | Steal a hidden stash of dreamlily. |
| 5 | Broker a deal with the Boromars on behalf of a city councilor who's too scared to face the family in person. |
| 6 | Find evidence that could be used to blackmail a member of a dragonmarked house. |

### Boromar Villains
With few exceptions, Boromar villains shun violence and would prefer to bribe, deceive, or manipulate the characters rather than send a squad of goons to attack them. That said, any of these villains and their minions will respond in kind if they are attacked or threatened.

Examples of Boromar Clan villains appear on the Boromar Clan Villains table.

##### Boromar Villains
| d6 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A halfling dreamlily dealer (an excoriate of House Ghallanda) smooth-talks new customers into sampling her wares. If pressed, she can call in favors from a number of dangerous clients. |
| 2 | A judge known as "the Turnkey" always rules in favor of Boromar Clan members. |
| 3 | A halfling pickpocket using alter self to pose as a child of another race plants contraband on people the Boromars are trying to frame. |
| 4 | A Boromar rogue has kidnapped the child of a strongly anti-Boromar city councilor. |
| 5 | A kalashtar psychic serves the clan by detecting thoughts that suggest possibilities for blackmail. What stray thought might they pick up from an adventurer? |
| 6 | A Boromar smuggler is bringing unstable explosives or an especially addictive form of dreamlily into Sharn, and innocents are being hurt. |

### Boromar Clan Campaign Themes
The true power of the Boromar Clan lies in its institutions: watch officers who have been allied to the clan for generations, judges who are blackmailed into compliance, and officials who receive lucrative bribes in exchange for their cooperation. Adventurers who oppose the Boromars might discover that people they think of as friends and allies are in the pocket of the clan. The Boromars are villains in the noir tradition, and adventurers determined to tangle with them will be drawn down into the mud.

The Boromar Clan could serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in *chapter 1*. The Boromar Clan Assignments table provides goals for adventurers who are working with the clan, and the "*Crime Syndicate*" section of *chapter 1* includes additional ideas.

##### Boromar Clan Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Find evidence of an affair between two members of different dragonmarked houses. |
| 2 | Collect from a fence who is late with a payment. |
| 3 | Steal the bank records of a city councilor. |
| 4 | Convince a Sharn Watch captain to aggressively root out Daask operatives. |
| 5 | Retrieve a package of dreamlily that has gone astray. |
| 6 | Discover the location of a Daask safe house. |

### Boromar Clan Adventure Hooks
The Boromar Clan Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Boromar Clan.

##### Boromar Clan Adventure Hooks
| d4 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Daask forces capture Boromar family members who are visiting Sharn from the Talenta Plains. The Boromars offer a reward for the safe return of their family and a larger reward for the kidnappers' heads, leading to gang violence in the streets. |
| 2 | A beloved Sharn Watch captain who openly spoke out against the Boromar Clan disappears. The Boromars claim they had nothing to do with it, but some Sharn Watch members use the incident as an excuse to go after the organization. |
| 3 | A changeling stole a smuggled artifact of great value from the Boromar Clan. Boromar enforcers shake down people all over Sharn to find it, and clan leaders consider going to war with the Tyrants. |
| 4 | The Boromars stage a festival in Callestan for Saidan's birthday. All of the family's allies will be there, creating opportunities for espionage and assassination. |

## Daask
Formed by monstrous immigrants from Droaam, Daask has been building its power in the Khyber's Gate and Malleon's Gate districts of Sharn for the last decade. It is most infamous for its monstrous enforcers, but the organization also draws members from the destitute populace of Sharn—largely goblins and shifters, but also humans, dwarves, and any other humanoid who feels that the current system has failed them. Daask makes its money through acts of violence, from mugging to armed robbery to outright pillaging. The group has diversified in recent years, building an extortion racket—threatening violence if tribute isn't paid—and entering into the drug trade, selling both dreamlily and a mysterious substance called dragon's blood.

From the outside, Daask appears to be interested solely in fomenting violence and chaos. The monstrous nature of its members reinforces this impression; most people consider the members of Daask to be savage beasts. The truth is more complicated. The Droaamites who make up the core of Daask aren't merely criminals; they are elite soldiers of Droaam working for Sora Katra, and part of an operation that is taking root in larger cities across Khorvaire. The seemingly random attacks by Daask are part of a larger plan that, if it succeeds, will eventually give Sora Katra a foothold in the heart of Khorvaire.

Over the last two years, the Daask cell in Sharn has been waging a slowly escalating war against the holdings of the Boromar Clan. The Boromars were surprised by the violence of these attacks and have suffered significant losses. Daask prefers guerrilla tactics, using only as many combatants as necessary to get a job done, never staying in one place too long, and quickly retreating back to their turf. Though the Boromars still control much of criminal activity in the middle and upper parts of Sharn, Daask is gaining ground in the lower level of the city and controls crime in the Cogs.

### Daask Operations
Violence and intimidation are Daask's most used tools. Rather than using bribery, Daask manipulates the Sharn Watch through displays of force and brutal reprisals against officers who dare to stand in the way. Coupled with the fact that Daask primarily targets businesses with ties to the Boromars, this means that many of the Watch officers of the lower wards will step aside and allow a Daask raid to run its course.

As Daask has seized territory from the Boromar Clan, it has also begun taking over a few of the clan's traditional businesses. In addition to dreamlily, Daask sells a highly addictive drug called dragon's blood.

Daask has another, perhaps surprising area of operation: religion. The organization has brought priests of the Dark Six to Sharn and has restored a ruined temple to the Dark Six in Khyber's Gate. Followers of the Dark Six have few other opportunities to practice their faith, and providing this new facility for them has made many allies for Daask across the city.

### Daask NPCs
Daask's lower ranks are made up of goblinoids, humans, shifters, and other humanoids recruited from the population of Sharn. The Droaamish soldiers that make up the core of the organization include changelings, gnolls, harpies, ogres, minotaurs, medusas, trolls, and other monstrous beings. Basilisks, cockatrices, death dogs, displacer beasts, and similar monsters are kept by Daask, though these creatures are usually used only within the Cogs.

Some of Daask's most important members are these individuals:

- Sora Katra is the ultimate leader of Daask, but as one of the Daughters of Sora Kell, she remains in Droaam. The hag stays in contact with all of her main subordinates by magic and keeps a detailed ledger of the group's activities.
- Cavallah is a disciplined female **oni** and the current leader of the Daask cell in Sharn. She is the mastermind of the organization's machinations against the Boromar Clan, a scholar obsessed with studying Sharn's manifest zone, and a devoted servant of Sora Katra. The **oni** wears a *hag eye* (see "Hags" in the *Monster Manual*) that enables Sora Katra to both see and hear what occurs in her presence.
- Harash, a male **medusa**, is Cavallah's right hand. He is a specialist in diplomacy and intimidation whom Cavallah trusts to monitor the members of Daask and maintain morale.
- Ash is a female human priest of the Shadow. As the most powerful and beloved of Daask's priests, she runs the Temple of the Six. Some worry that Ash plans to challenge Cavallah for leadership, which could cause a rift in the organization's membership.
- The **gnoll** Keshta commands a small unit of elite gnoll commandos. Disciplined and ruthless, these soldiers are often called upon to carry out retaliatory strikes against those who defy Daask.
- Zaeran, an elf **werewolf**, is a recent arrival to Sharn. He's one of the sons of the Droaamish warlord Zaeurl. Zaeran has come to the city with a small group of wererats and werewolves, and has an agenda known only to himself and Sora Katra.

### Cog Hub
Daask members congregate in safe houses that are hard to find and easy to defend or escape from. The most popular gathering location is a Cog hub. The dark, twisting halls of these underworld hot spots are familiar to Daask members and confusing to their enemies. A Cog hub's tight passages have plenty of choke points, forcing one-on-one confrontations in which Daask's powerful monsters often have the advantage. Daask also uses Cog hubs to stash bodies, drugs, or prisoners.

Trying to find a Daask hub in the Cogs is an adventure in itself. Most members are understandably tight-lipped about the location of their meeting and hiding places. Once the characters know a hub's location, they still must navigate the mazelike Cogs to find the place.

#### Cog Hub Features
The Cog hub shown in map 4.13 could be a Daask location, or it could be any Sharn underworld location you need it to be. Several crafted and natural labyrinthine passages no more than 10 feet wide lead to the main chamber. Many of these passages connect with stairs, ladders, and wells that lead higher or lower in the Cogs, in addition to small chambers that could be ambush points, temporary quarters for criminals or squatters, or places to lay a trap or place an alarm trigger.

These passages converge into a single large chamber that can hold a large group for meetings and serve as a temporary safe house or a place to stash contraband. When criminals occupy the area, at least one guard is always on duty, and typically there is one guard at every entrance to the chamber.

Smaller rooms with heavy iron doors adjoin the largest chamber. These rooms can serve as holding cells for captives, vaults for valuables, or hiding spots.

#### Cog Hub Adventures
The Cog Hub Adventures table offers reasons why your characters might need to visit such a location. In addition, the characters could meet with a Daask patron in a Cog hub.

##### Cog Hub Adventures

| 10 | Place a lethal trap in a Cog hub, to be triggered the next time Daask forces enter the place. |

### Daask Villains
If Daask villains want something, they take it, and they destroy anything that gets in their way. Though some members of the organization are brutes, many are more cunning than they appear. Often what seems to be random violence might be motivated by something other than greed and cruelty.

Examples of Daask villains appear on the Daask Villains table.

##### Daask Villains
| d6 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Several **harpies** travel to the upper wards and use their luring songs to make rich people fall to their deaths. The harpies pick the corpses for valuables. |
| 2 | A pack of **gnolls** rampages through the lower wards, killing any halflings they come across. The gnolls take the halflings' ears as trophies. |
| 3 | A shifter priest of the Devourer wants to crash Skyway by performing a ritual to create a cataclysmic storm. Sacrifices to the Devourer fuels the ritual. |
| 4 | A changeling agent of Daask seeks to frame the Tyrants for attacks on the Boromar Clan, driving a wedge between the two organizations. |
| 5 | A wererat priest of the Mockery starts a cult in Lower Dura, teaching its followers the arts of assassination. |
| 6 | A gargoyle sharpshooter continually finds new vantage points in the upper wards from where it can assassinate targets in the middle and lower wards. |

### Daask Campaign Themes
On the surface, Daask appear to be nothing more complicated than a gang of violent monsters wreaking havoc in the worst parts of the city. If you want, this can be the only role they play in a campaign: a ready source of sudden violence. Low-level characters might work with the Sharn Watch or the Boromar Clan to curtail Daask muggings and raid dreamlily houses. This crusade against Daask will escalate as the adventurers become more powerful; Daask will unleash ever more powerful monsters, and its forces might start targeting the adventurer's allies and loved ones. Those attacks won't end until the adventurers delve deep into the Cogs and defeat Cavallah herself.

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—Monstrous Deception
>>Monsters are infiltrating our city! Though the Sharn Watch acts as though Daask is a problem only for Malleon's Gate, and not a threat to law-abiding citizens, there is clear cunning in the criminal cabal's actions. Their recent attacks have targeted properties throughout the lower wards, all owned by a certain halfling family, as if Daask were attempting a violent takeover of Sharn's underworld. Once these monsters control the city's crime, what will they do next?
>>

Another option is to delve deeper into the motives of Daask, to explore the idea that these monsters aren't as savage as they appear. The elite members of Daask are spies, soldiers, and saboteurs using their criminal activities as a cover for their true agenda. What is Sora Katra really trying to accomplish in Sharn? This question ties to how you decide to use the Daughters of Sora Kell, described earlier in this chapter. Do the Daughters simply want to ravage their enemies? Or, guided by the oracular visions of Sora Teraza, are they actually working toward some greater good? For instance, Daask agents could break into the vaults and workshops of dragonmarked houses and discover secret projects forbidden by the Treaty of Thronehold. They could clash with spies of foreign powers in Sharn, or pursue ancient artifacts in the ruins below the city to keep them out of others' hands.

Dreamlily is relatively safe; dragon's blood is not. Its effects are intentionally unpredictable, and you can take this idea wherever you like. Could drinking dragon's blood cause someone to develop a dragonmark? Could it turn addicts into crazed, draconic creatures? Is Daask simply selling it to make money, or is the drug's introduction part of a grander plan? Neither the Boromar Clan or the dragonmarked houses have been able to learn anything important about dragon's blood.

Daask can also serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in *chapter 1*. The Daask Assignments table provides objectives for adventurers working with the organization, and the discussion of crime syndicates in *chapter 1* includes additional ideas for parties with a crime syndicate patron.

##### Daask Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Convince several new businesses in the lower wards to pay protection fees to Daask. |
| 2 | Cause as much death and destruction as possible inside a Boromar-owned establishment. |
| 3 | Guard a priest of the Dark Six as he preaches the word of the Mockery on the street. |
| 4 | Assassinate a member of the Boromar Clan. |
| 5 | Convince a dragonmarked noble to offer the house's services to Daask for free. |
| 6 | Mug someone to steal a magic item in their possession. |

### Daask Adventure Hooks
The Daask Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around Daask.

##### Daask Adventure Hooks
| d4 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Daask **harpies** raid a Skyway mansion and tear the place apart looking for a Boromar Clan member. |
| 2 | People who take dragon's blood begin turning to stone, and no one can figure out why. |
| 3 | Cavallah announces a contest within the organization, promising a valuable magic item to whichever Daask soldier kills the most members of the Boromar Clan. |
| 4 | Ash challenges Cavallah for control of Daask, creating a schism that erupts into a violent gang war. |

## House Tarkanan

>> ##### The Voice of Breland—Assassins on the loose!
>>It is common knowledge that those with aberrant marks can't be trusted. It's not their fault; they're touched by Khyber, and the Dragon Below twists their minds. All aberrants will eventually become killers. And though I can see the appeal in using these creatures as weapons against our enemies, how could we bring such vipers into our midst?
>>
>>According to a high-ranking source in the King's Citadel, this secret operation predictably ended in disaster. After a few missions, the strike force slew their handlers and deserted, disappearing into the criminal underworld. They could be anywhere. There can be no clearer sign that it's time to bring down the monarchy and institute a government that is chosen by and answerable to the common people!
>>

Long ago, the dragonmarked houses sought to exterminate the bearers of *aberrant dragonmarks*. Today, those who carry aberrant dragonmarks are still treated with fear and suspicion. During the Last War, the King's Dark Lanterns of Breland trained a team of covert operatives who all bore aberrant marks. Considered expendable, this group was sent on one suicide mission after another. After half its members died in the field, the survivors turned on their masters. Six years ago, they fled to Sharn and founded House Tarkanan. The group takes its name from Lord Halas Tarkanan, who fought the dragonmarked houses long ago and used his aberrant dragonmark to destroy Old Sharn.

The smallest of the four criminal organizations described here, House Tarkanan has no interest in claiming territory or dominating the criminal underworld. The house takes neither side in the war between the Boromar Clan and Daask, and it will not assassinate high-ranking members of either organization. In other matters, it sells its services to all who have the gold to pay for them. House Tarkanan's top priority is using its wealth to protect, train, and care for people who have aberrant marks. The leaders of the house are pragmatists and soldiers, and they train their recruits to be warriors and thieves.

Despite its name, House Tarkanan is not a dragonmarked house; it has taken the name to mock its enemies, and it doesn't have the recognition, power, or resources of a dragonmarked house. In fact, many members of House Tarkanan hate the dragonmarked houses for being prejudiced against their kind and fear that they will instigate a second purge of aberrant marks. Others are more idealistic, and see the growing power of the houses as a threat to all of the nations of Khorvaire.

### House Tarkanan Operations
House Tarkanan provides two basic services to clients: theft and murder. Fees for jobs are based on the task's complexity and riskiness; a simple cutpurse contract costs far less than the assassination of a Sharn Watch captain in Skyway.

What differentiates the assassins of House Tarkanan from those of House Phiarlan and Thuranni is their accessibility. The dragonmarked houses sell their services only to a select list of wealthy and powerful clients, and they can pursue contracts anywhere in Khorvaire. Conversely, anyone with enough gold can hire House Tarkanan's assassins, but they take jobs only within Sharn.

### House Tarkanan NPCs
Because House Tarkanan helps all those who have aberrant dragonmarks, the organization has allies across a wide range of society, from beggars to nobles. Some of the organization's most important people are these:

- Thora, a female human, has the ability to sense mystical energies—a gift that enables her to identify others with aberrant marks. She founded the organization and serves as its leader. While she uses the name Thora Tarkanan among her compatriots, she has established herself as Thora Tavin among the wealthy elite of Sharn and has cultivated relationships with many influential people.
- Rotting Bal is one of Thora's most trusted lieutenants. A male human, Bal was part of the original squad of aberrant commandos. He's an exceptional martial artist whose skills are enhanced by his mark.
- Zae is a female halfling who has the power to speak to and control vermin. Though she's no warrior, her gift helps the house gather information.

### House Tarkanan Villains
Some House Tarkanan villains are obsessed with bringing down the dragonmarked houses. Others are willing to take innocent lives if doing so means saving one person with an aberrant mark. Sample villains appear on the House Tarkanan Villains table.

##### House Tarkanan Villains
| d4 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A member of House Tarkanan murders members of dragonmarked houses, reducing her victims to smoldering piles of ash. |
| 2 | Driven mad by his aberrant dragonmark, a dwarf becomes obsessed with destroying Sharn in the same manner that Halas Tarkanan collapsed Old Sharn. |
| 3 | A House Tarkanan half-elf kidnaps children with aberrant marks, believing the organization is better suited to bring up the children than their parents. |
| 4 | A House Tarkanan mage starts drinking the blood of dragonmarked nobles, believing it will increase the strength of his aberrant mark. |

### House Tarkanan Campaign Themes
As assassins for hire, the members of House Tarkanan can appear in a campaign as agents of other enemies of the adventurers. But they can also play a central role in a campaign.

To use House Tarkanan as a recurring villain, you can stress its ruthlessness and emphasize its hatred of the dragonmarked houses. If any of the adventurers have ties to one of the houses, this confrontation could begin with a number of small attacks against the adventurer or their friends. Over time, these actions could escalate. In addition, you could build a story around Thora Tarkanan's quest to discover the secrets of aberrant dragonmarks. Long ago, Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague possessed marks so powerful that they could destroy cities. Can Thora find a way to amplify her own power in the ruins of Old Sharn?

If one or more of the adventurers has an aberrant dragonmark, House Tarkanan can also serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in *chapter 1*. The House Tarkanan Assignments table provides hooks for adventurers who are working with the organization, and the discussion of crime syndicates in *chapter 1* includes additional ideas.

##### House Tarkanan Assignments
| d4 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Steal a satchel full of research on the War of the Mark, carried by a wizard who works at Morgrave University. |
| 2 | Kill a Karrnathi warlord who is visiting Sharn, and make it look like an accident. |
| 3 | Kill a target before she signs her last will and testament to assign her property to a new heir. |
| 4 | Rescue a dreamlily dealer with an aberrant mark who has been captured by the Sharn Watch. |

### House Tarkanan Adventure Hooks
The House Tarkanan Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for adventures themed around House Tarkanan.

##### House Tarkanan Adventure Hooks
| d4 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | House Tarkanan disturbed the dead during an expedition to Old Sharn, causing undead to terrorize the city above. |
| 2 | House Tarkanan declares war on the dragonmarked houses in Sharn and begins killing nobles in the streets. Many of the houses' businesses in the city are shut down as fear spreads. |
| 3 | A victim who was killed by a House Tarkanan assassin returns as an undead that tries to kill anyone who bears an aberrant mark. |
| 4 | House Tarkanan steals a key that can disable a ticking time bomb created by an artificer. |

## The Tyrants
No criminal guild in Sharn is more shrouded in mystery than the Tyrants. This organization of changelings deals in secrets and lies, selling forgeries, running long cons, and treating identities as a commodity. The Tyrants have spies throughout the city, even in places where they have no current plans or contracts. The organization gathers as many secrets as possible, then sells that information to the highest bidder, uses it for blackmail, or stores it for a time when it becomes useful.

The Tyrants have been operating in Sharn for over three hundred years from a base of operations in the Dragoneyes district, in Lower Tavick's Landing. They have agents spread across the city. A beggar, a bartender, or a courtier could actually be a persona crafted by a Tyrant changeling. The Tyrants have a long-standing truce with the Boromar Clan and don't take a side in the halfling family's conflict with Daask.

### Tyrants Operations
The Tyrants are master grifters, conducting a host of short and long cons throughout the city. Much like the Boromar Clan, they have a general live-and-let-live relationship with the Sharn Watch. As long as the Tyrants focus their crimes on foreigners and tourists—and donate generously to the local Watch—the officers will look the other way. In addition to pursuing their own schemes for gold, Tyrant charlatans offer a host of services to their clients; they can help to frame innocents for crimes, or make it possible for a criminal to seem to be in two places at once, providing an ironclad alibi.

The finest forgers in the city are in the ranks of the Tyrants, capable of duplicating anything from identification papers to works of art. Magewrights among the Tyrants have the ability to permanently alter someone's appearance.

First and foremost, the Tyrants deal in information. They hoard secrets, and for the right price they can be persuaded to share what they know. Occasionally a Tyrant approaches someone with an offer of information in exchange for gold.

### Tyrants NPCs
Members of the Tyrants have a loose definition of identity. The majority of the members are changelings. They often maintain multiple identities, and a particular identity might be shared among a group of changelings. A captain in the Sharn Watch who is actually an agent of the Tyrants might be portrayed by a member of the Tyrants' inner circle in the morning, when he has to interact with a wide range of people. But when he goes off-duty in the evening and keeping up the identity is an easier task, the role might be taken over by a young recruit.

The following individuals are some of the Tyrant's most important identities:

- Ek, often called Tyrant One, guides the inner circle of changelings that leads the organization.
- Kilk is the city councilor for Lower Tavick's Landing and is a fictional persona created by the Tyrants, played by a variety of changelings at different times.
- The Spider is a changeling information broker who owns a cosmetics store called Honest Faces in the Dragoneyes district. This location is a common destination for people who want to purchase secrets from the Tyrants. Though the Spider often sells secrets for gold, sometimes it will trade its knowledge only for services or other secrets.

### Tyrants Villains
The Tyrants are a covert force. They operate in the shadows, trade identities, and like to manipulate their enemies into fighting each other. Tyrant villains rarely show their true faces. Examples of Tyrants villains appear on the Tyrants Villains table.

##### Tyrants Villains
| d6 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A changeling rogue infiltrates adventuring parties to steal their magic items. |
| 2 | A cabal of changelings shares an identity as a Sharn Watch captain. They use the disguise to free criminals from prison. |
| 3 | A changeling assassin murders members of the Boromar Clan, Daask, and House Tarkanan, then takes on the identities of its victims. |
| 4 | A changeling bard gathers incriminating information about members of the King's Dark Lanterns, then blackmails them. |
| 5 | A Brelish changeling veteran of the Last War was distrusted by fellow soldiers because of the shapechanger's heritage. The veteran now exposes those soldiers' darkest secrets to their friends, families, and employers. |
| 6 | A changeling mage masquerades as a priest of the Silver Flame and uses spells to send the religion's faithful "signs" from Tira Miron that encourage them to spy, steal, and kill for the Tyrants. |

### Tyrants Campaign Themes
The primary theme of the Tyrants is mystery. In dealing with the Tyrants, there is always a question of what is real and what the true objective actually is. With the Tyrants, anything could be a long con, and both allies and enemies may not be who they appear to be.

The Tyrants have three objectives: acquiring gold, gathering secrets, and protecting the changelings of Sharn. In working the Tyrants into a campaign, the first question is which of these objectives will take precedence. Are they primarily grifters, trying to squeeze as much profit as possible out of the situation? Are they mainly working to gather secrets, and to use those secrets to manipulate others? Or are they most concerned with helping other changelings, who are often with the objects of fear and suspicion?

The Tyrants offer an easy way to provide adventurers with information. The Spider can be a strong ally for adventurers, and you can always arrange for an agent of the Tyrants to step out of the shadows with and offer to sell a secret.

The Tyrants could also have a long-term sinister agenda—something they've been working on for generations, which is only coming to fruition now. Do they want to replace the entire city council of Sharn, or are their aspirations even higher than that? In a campaign that examines this idea, the Tyrants might impersonate the patrons and allies of the adventurers, thereby tricking them into carrying out questionable tasks.

The Tyrants can also serve as a group patron for a party of adventurers, as described in *chapter 1*, especially if the party includes one or more changelings. The Tyrants Assignments table provides hooks for adventurers working with the organization, and the discussion of crime syndicates in *chapter 1* includes additional ideas.

##### Tyrants Assignments
| d6 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Kill an important figure without leaving evidence behind so a member of the Tyrants can replace the target. |
| 2 | Steal a formal badge of office or uniform for a member of the Tyrants to use as part of an assumed identity. |
| 3 | Act as bodyguards for a member of the Tyrants who is pretending to be an important figure. |
| 4 | Assume new identities to infiltrate the Sharn Watch and steal criminal records. |
| 5 | Use incriminating information to blackmail a member of the city council. |
| 6 | Find evidence that can be used to blackmail a member of a dragonmarked house. |

### Tyrants Adventure Hooks
The Tyrants Adventure Hooks table presents ideas for additional adventures themed around the Tyrants.

##### Tyrants Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A friendly NPC dies in combat. The corpse reveals its true form to be that of a changeling. |
| 2 | A list of Tyrants agents and their identities exists somewhere in Sharn. Every legitimate and criminal organization in the city competes to find it. |
| 3 | The *Sharn Inquisitive* publishes an anonymous article accusing several members of the Sharn Watch, the city council, and the dragonmarked houses of being changeling members of the Tyrants. The accused individuals vehemently deny the claims. |
| 4 | A shamed Brelish general of the Last War goes on a killing spree against changelings, claiming the Tyrants ruined his life by exposing his extramarital affair. |
| 5 | A Sharn Watch captain being blackmailed by the Tyrants has had enough. He publicly exposes his incriminating secrets, then offers a reward for information concerning the organization. |
| 6 | Roll on another organization's Adventure Hooks table; the Tyrants are secretly involved in the situation. |

![[142-4-11.png|right|300]]

## Sharn Watch
A common viewpoint among the citizens of Sharn is that in the upper wards, the Sharn Watch works for the wealthy; in the middle wards, it works for the Boromar Clan; and in the lower wards, it doesn't work at all. This assessment is close enough to the truth. There's an important undercurrent in the situation, however. Although most officers of the Watch take bribes, that doesn't mean all of them don't care about their city and won't try to keep their communities safe; they do so because they see their benefactors as being an important part of the continued health of their community. For instance, those officers who take gold from the Boromar Clan believe that the Boromars help keep the city running and give the people what they want. But if some strangers in town break the law, they're just troublemakers who deserve to be run in.

As another example, the guards of the Dura Bazaar have an understanding with the gang of pickpockets known as the Little Fingers. As long as the thieves target only tourists and foreigners, the Watch will dismiss any charges brought against them. Why should an officer of the Sharn Watch care if some Aundarian with more gold than sense gets robbed? But if the Little Fingers pick on a local, they're asking for trouble. The relationship works both ways; the pickpockets are privy to things the Watch officers aren't, and they often warn the Watch about suspicious people or activities they witness.

Watch officers do exist who are entirely crooked and care nothing for the law. At the other extreme, some officers are entirely honorable and place the law above all else, and most of those are willing to risk their lives to save an innocent bystander from a rampaging Daask troll. But most members of the Watch are pragmatists who put the needs of their clients uppermost, the needs of the citizenry second, and generally don't take action against locals.

The upshot of all this is that the Watch's response to a crime can vary significantly depending on the nature of the crime and where it's committed. As a rule, when a crime is committed in Skyway, any of the upper or middle wards, Lower Central, Lower Tavick's Landing, or Precarious, members of the Watch arrive to intervene and investigate as soon as possible. In Cliffside, Lower Menthis, and Lower Northedge, the few Watch members in these locations address crimes in order of priority. In Lower Dura and the Cogs, the Watch's reponse is typically very slow.

### Sharn Watch Divisions
The discussion above primarily concerns the rank and file of the Sharn Watch, the guards who walk the streets day in and day out and the officers who supervise them. The Watch also includes a few special divisions that could cross the paths of the adventurers.

**The Blackened Book** is an elite core of abjurers and diviners, charged with investigating and containing magical threats. These wizards are highly dedicated to their work and their city, and generally don't take bribes. It's up to the higher-ups, however, to decide what missions to assign to the Blackened Book; if there's a case that a noble doesn't want investigated, it probably won't be.

**The Guardians of the Gate** came into being during the Last War to monitor the activities of foreign nationals and immigrants. Their duties have expanded since the surge of refugees into Sharn following the Mourning, and the Guardians of the Gate closely supervise the district of High Walls. The Guardians are chosen from among the best soldiers of the Watch and are devoted to their city. Many of them, however, place the safety of the city ahead of strict adherence to the law, and complaints are raised against them from time to time for unnecessary violence against refugees.

**The Redcloak Battalion** is an exceptional unit of soldiers that is called upon if a situation calls for extreme military force. The Redcloaks are heroes of the Last War, and now that the fighting is over most of them don't appreciate being used as local police. The Redcloaks are absolutely faithful to Breland: they are willing to lay down their lives in the service of their nation. Trying to bribe a Redcloak is a good way to lose a hand. Like the Blackened Book, however, the Redcloaks are elite troops that act only when they're mustered by a captain of the Watch; typically, they won't be asked to respond to a situation if it's not in the interests of the Boromar Clan. The Redcloak Battalion is described in more detail in *chapter 3*.

### Sharn Watch NPCs
The Sharn Watch includes people from all walks of life: veterans of the Last War, retired adventurers, lifelong residents of the city, and immigrants who have become Brelish citizens. You can select from or roll on the Sharn Watch Races and Sharn Watch Personalities tables to generate a Watch NPC. There is a 75 percent chance the NPC is taking bribes from the Boromar Clan or another wealthy patron. This doesn't necessarily mean that the officer is willing to take a bribe from one of the adventurers.

>> ##### The Sharn Inquisitive—A Life of Watchful Service
>>Brelish folk often forget that the Guardians of the Gate have a civilian branch that handles administrative issues and special customs investigations. Tethyn Olar has led that arm of the Sharn Watch for more than a decade.
>>
>>Many immigrants owe their safe and comfortable lives in our city to this man, but claims have surfaced recently charging him with corruption, saying that he took money from immigrants in exchange for a faster path into Sharn. Olar has refuted those claims with this statement: "Look at the lower wards to see the vast number of poor immigrants the Gate allows to enter in the city. Those with wealth tend to be more responsible and quicker to put their paperwork together, but none with worthy cause to be here are barred."
>>

Some of the Sharn Watch's most important people are as follows:

- Lord Commander Iyan ir'Talan is a male human in charge of the Sharn Watch. As long as the city's wealthy elite are content to keep Iyan in power, he does little more than maintain the status quo.
- Commander Lian Halamar is a male halfling who leads the garrison in the Daggerwatch district in Upper Dura. The Boromar Clan bribes Lian to make sure the Watch is away from the scene during their criminal activities. The Boromars are pressuring Lian to crack down on Daask, but he has no desire to put his officers in danger unnecessarily.
- Commander Belew Yorgan is a male dwarf who leads the Sword Point garrison in Middle Central. He does his best to serve the interests of the nobles and wealthy patrons in the Central Plateau, and as a result these wards are among the safest in Sharn. But Yorgan's loyalties are first and foremost to his purse, and the troops under his command serve whoever's paying the most.
- Commander Silaena Cazal is a female elf who runs the Warden Towers garrison in Middle Menthis. Over a century of service, she has woven a net of graft and extortion across Menthis Plateau; she looks after those who pay their dues. Her mother was driven from House Phiarlan when she developed an aberrant dragonmark. Because of that treatment, Silaena harbors deep resentment for the dragonmarked houses and will occasionally take actions to inconvenience them. Thora Tavin of House Tarkanan is working to strengthen her relationship with Commander Cazal.
- Commander Iyanna ir'Talan is a female human who commands the Black Arch garrison in Lower Tavick's Landing. The daughter of the Lord Commander, Iyanna is idealistic and honorable. She fights for the good of the common people. If the adventurers need an honest ally in the Watch, Iyanna is perhaps their best hope. Despite her father's best efforts to keep her from getting entangled in the criminal underworld, her actions have won her no friends among Sharn's crime lords, and her life could be in danger despite her parentage.
- Lady Warden Maira ir'Talan, a distant relative of the Lord Commander, leads the Blackened Book. A gifted diviner, Maira is a highly effective leader. What none know is that she's also an agent of the Dreaming Dark. Five years ago, a **kalaraq quori** (see *chapter 6*) named Tirashana implanted a mind seed in her thoughts. Maira continues to do her job while concealing any evidence of the Dreaming Dark's schemes.
- Captain Daja Brel is a female human who commands the Guardians of the Gate. Daja firmly believes that the Guardians are all that stands between order and chaos in Sharn, and she acts with unbridled force if she believes a group or an individual threatens the city.
- Captain Khandan Dol is a male dwarf who leads the Redcloak Battalion. Khandan is a local legend who served in the Brelish army throughout the Last War; he was knighted by the last king of Galifar and swore an oath to the first queen of Breland. He enjoys drinking and gambling. He takes discipline seriously, though, and expects his soldiers to show complete loyalty to their country and its king. Because of his experiences in the war, he has a deep dislike for Thranes and followers of the Silver Flame, but he rarely lets these feelings interfere with his duties.

### Watch Station
Sharn Watch stations are located throughout the city. The largest are the garrison posts like Daggerwatch and Sword Point; smaller stations in various places are used to hold criminals, dispatch patrols, and take care of day-to-day business.

A typical Sharn Watch station has two well-guarded entrances. One is connected to a main vestibule, where an officer in a security room with a magically reinforced window signs visitors in and confiscates their spell components, spellcasting focuses, and weapons. The other entrance is a large barred and warded door that leads to the garage, which holds skycoaches and soarsleds. Both of these areas are connected to the station's bullpen by way of locked and warded doors.

The Watch Station Adventures table offers reasons why the characters might need to visit (or break into) such a location.

##### Watch Station Adventures
| d6 | Adventure Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Destroy evidence of a crime that's being stored in a Watch station, or plant evidence in a Watch station to frame someone for a crime. |
| 2 | Learn which members of a station's crew are on the payroll of a criminal organization. |
| 3 | Ensure the station's Watch officers are indisposed during an upcoming crime spree. |
| 4 | Help defend a Watch station from a siege. |
| 5 | Free someone being held at a Watch station. |
| 6 | Steal uniforms from a Watch station. |

### Sharn Watch Villains
Corrupt or extremist members of the Sharn Watch are villains of a special sort: legitimate authority figures who have access to the city's law-enforcement resources. The protections these villains enjoy often call for drastic measures to stop them, which the characters might be labeled as criminals themselves and might have to go underground to avoid arrest or harassment. Examples of Sharn Watch villains appear on the Sharn Watch Villains table.

##### Sharn Watch Villains
| d6 | Villain |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A dwarf arrests random halflings on the streets in the lower wards and allows Daask agents to interrogate and torture them. |
| 2 | A Brelish veteran of the Last War arrests and murders innocent Cyran refugees, claiming each time that the victim tried to attack him. |
| 3 | A changeling investigator works for the Tyrants and pins unsolved crimes on other Sharn Watch members who interfere with the Tyrants' business. |
| 4 | A half-elf works her way through the ranks of the Sharn Watch by assassinating her superiors but making it look like they died in the line of duty. |
| 5 | An elf in the lower wards comes to the aid of only those who pay a monthly protection fee. |
| 6 | A Blackened Book mage confiscates magic items from others to auction off to criminals. |

#### Sharn Watch Campaign Themes
If you want to make the Sharn Watch a significant part of the campaign, you can develop a story for a particular commander. Lian Halamar is the primary agent of the Boromar Clan, and if the adventurers are fighting the Clan, any interaction with the Watch can ultimately come to Lian's attention, with his corruption slowly becoming more and more evident. If the characters oppose House Tarkanan, it could be Commander Cazal who keeps interfering with their investigations and placing obstacles in their way. Can the adventurers find a way to remove their rival from power?

Another option is to focus a story on Commander Iyanna and her efforts to purge corruption from the Watch. A chance encounter could bring the two together; perhaps the adventurers are on the scene when Iyanna is targeted by assassins. Iyanna could call on the adventurers to investigate corruption and to deal with officers who are breaking their oaths. How deep are they willing to go?

If the adventurers do form an alliance with a Watch officer, you can use the Sharn Watch Assignments table to create adventure hooks for parties and side quests for individual characters—cases their ally doesn't trust the Watch regulars to handle fairly.

##### Sharn Watch Assignments
| d8 | Assignment |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Solve a murder that occurred in Skyway. |
| 2 | Find a dreamlily den and arrest the place's owner and its supplier. |
| 3 | Protect an ambassador from Sarlona who is joining a Morgrave University expedition to the Cogs. |
| 4 | Monitor the Lyrandar Tower airship dock for a specific criminal reportedly trying to leave the city. |
| 5 | Apprehend a war criminal rumored to be arriving in Sharn by lightning rail, and deliver the criminal to the nearest Watch station. |
| 6 | Take a visiting dignitary on a tour of the city and keep them happy. |
| 7 | Venture into the bowels of the city to find a wanted terrorist who has kidnapped a magewright and stolen the parts needed to build an explosive device. |
| 8 | Handle a prisoner exchange—one captured criminal for one captured Sharn Watch officer. |

### Sharn Watch Adventure Hooks

| 1 | The Sharn Watch cracks down on Daask, which leads to violent confrontations in the city's lower wards. |
| 2 | The Sharn Inquisitive publishes an article claiming that changelings of the Tyrants have stolen the identities of many Watch officers, leading to citywide distrust of the organization. |
| 3 | After a Thrane immigrant opens a sealed entrance to Old Sharn's ruins, the Guardians of the Gate do not allow anyone in or out of Sharn until the immigrant is found and the entrance is resealed. |
| 4 | Agents of the Blackened Book find scrying sensors in Sharn Watch stations throughout the city. |

# Treasures
Magic plays a vital role in the day-to-day life of Khorvaire. Common magic items are widespread, and the crystals known as dragonshards serve as the fuel of the magical economy and are used in items that amplify the powers of dragonmarks.

![[148-5-01.jpg|right|300]](Khyber dragonshards glimmer as a dolgaunt and dolgrims try to pry open a Gatekeeper seal)

## Dragonshards
Dragonshards aren't magic items themselves but are crystals imbued with magical energy. They play a vital role in the creation of magic items and the performance of certain rituals in Eberron. Dragonshards come in three varieties, each found in a different environment.

![[149-5-02.png|right|300]]

**Eberron dragonshards** are found in shallow soil and often encased in geode-like stone shells. Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust's market value is the same as the replaced component). Eberron dragonshard dust is used in the creation of some magic items, and many powerful tools—such as the lightning rail and elemental airships—require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.

**Khyber dragonshards** are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding—which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons—requires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.

**Siberys dragonshards** fall from the Ring of Siberys, the ring of crystals that encircles the world. While rare in Khorvaire, there are significant Siberys dragonshard fields in the continent of Xen'drik, and this is a potential source of great wealth for explorers. Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement. Larger ones may be required for eldritch machines or the creation of legendary items or artifacts.

## Magic Items
The world of Eberron thrums with the power of magic. Artificers, magewrights, wizards, and other spellcasters produce an abundance of magic items, particularly those with the common rarity.

## Magic Item Descriptions
This section presents a selection of magic items in alphabetical order. See the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for the rules on using magic items.

Some of the magic items in this chapter are symbiotic objects created by the daelkyr. While not fully sentient, these symbiotic items are partially organic. Attuning to such an item reflects physically bonding with it. While these objects aren't evil, some people might be disturbed upon seeing your living armor or tentacle whip!

- *Arcane Propulsion Arm*
- *Armblade*
- *Belashyrra's Beholder Crown*
- *Cleansing Stone*
- *Docent*
- *Dyrrn's Tentacle Whip*
- *Earworm*
- *Everbright Lantern*
- *Feather Token*
- *Finder's Goggles*
- *Glamerweave*
- *Imbued Wood Focus*
- *Keycharm*
- *Kyrzin's Ooze*
- *Living Armor*
- *Living Gloves*
- *Orb of Shielding*
- *Prosthetic Limb*
- *Scribe's Pen*
- *Shiftweave*
- *Speaking Stone*
- *Spellshard*
- *Ventilating Lungs*
- *Wand Sheath*
- *Wheel of Wind and Water*

## Eldritch Machines
In a Cannith enclave, a team of artificers maintain a creation forge that produces warforged. In the Shadow Marches, druids guard the seals that hold the daelkyr at bay. In the sewers below Sharn, a mad necromancer puts the final touches on a device that will turn the city's residents into undead. Such contraptions are categorized as eldritch machines—magical devices of immense power that are too large to be moved easily. Eldritch machines are marvels of magic and engineering that require special components and conditions to function. For example, a particular eldritch machine might function only in a manifest zone where two or more planes are coterminous.

Ultimately, eldritch machines are plot devices that can represent the culmination of a villain's master plan or a last defense against evil.

### Creation Forge
A creation forge is a spherical chamber that contains a floating obelisk. This obelisk creates warforged souls and places them in newly constructed warforged bodies. Only dragonmarked members of House Cannith can create and maintain such devices, and though the Treaty of Thronehold mandated the destruction of all creation forges in Khorvaire after the Last War, at least one creation forge is rumored to exist in the bowels of Sharn.

### Dimensional Seal
A dimensional seal is a massive stone slab covered with a complex pattern of runes and sigils. The seal projects an invisible field in a 2-mile radius. This field blocks all forms of conjuration magic and any other effect that involves teleportation or planar travel. Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches—reminders of the conflict between the Gatekeepers and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron. If enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be dire consequences for the world.

### Mabaran Resonator
This dread device draws on the power of Mabar, infusing the dead with the malign energy of the Endless Night. While it is active, any humanoid that dies within 2 miles of the resonator reanimates 1 minute later as a zombie (see the *Monster Manual* for its stat block) under the control of the creature controlling the device.

![[151-5-04.png|right|300]](Storm Spire)

### Master's Call
While this looks like a scrap heap assembled from shattered constructs, this eldritch machine possesses great power. A creature in control of it can sense the presence and location of all warforged within 10 miles of the device and can, as an action, send a telepathic message to them laced with enchantment magic. Such a message can be sent no more than once every 24 hours. A warforged who receives the message is compelled to follow one command contained within it, unless the warforged succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. The affected warforged breaks free of the command after 24 hours.

### Spell Sink
This device emanates an antimagic field (same effects as the *antimagic field* spell) in a radius of 1 to 3 miles. The field can be activated or deactivated as an action with a touch by its controller.

The form that the device takes depends on the nature of its creator. The Ashbound druids despise unnatural magic, so a spell sink created by them might be a living artifact, such as a twisted tree that consumes the magical energy around it. Conversely, a spell sink created by a mad artificer might be a massive vessel composed of dragonshards and exotic metals.

A variant device called the spell siphon not only neutralizes magic but also absorbs all magical energy in the area, storing that power for a cataclysmic effect.

### Storm Spire
This eldritch machine can only be controlled by creatures that bear the Mark of Storm. Storm spires allow House Lyrandar to influence the weather, which can be a boon for the local population or a curse if a Lyrandar baron chooses to demand payment for ideal weather.

## Everyday Magic Items
Thanks to dragonshards, common magic items—including the ones in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*—are readily available in Khorvaire.

### Buying a Common Magic item
In Eberron, common magic items can be found for sale in most communities. The DM determines the stock that is available, or the DM has the shoppers make a group Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a shop or peddler that has the desired item in stock. The DC for this check is 10 in a city, 15 in a town, and 20 in a village. If the check fails, at least 24 hours must pass before looking for the same item in that community.

The DM sets the price of a common magic item or determines it randomly: 2d4 × 10 gp, or half as much for a consumable item such as a potion or scroll.

### Creating Common Magic Items
Normally, a magic item in Eberron is created using the crafting rules in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* or *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*. But if you have a dragonshard, you can more easily create a common magic item.

To create such an item with a dragonshard, a character must have proficiency in the tools used to create a nonmagical version of the item or proficiency in the Arcana skill. For example, a *potion of healing* can be created by a character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit. A spellcaster can scribe a *spell scroll* of a spell they know if they have proficiency in the Arcana skill, and they must provide all material components required for the spell. A cantrip scribed onto a scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

The Creating Common Magic Items table states how much time and money you must spend to craft a common magic item with a dragonshard, which is expended in the creation process. The hours of creation can be spread over multiple days, which needn't be consecutive.

##### Creating Common Magic Items
| Common Magic Item | Time | Cost |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| *Spell scroll* (cantrip) | 8 hours | 15 gp |
| *Potion of healing* | 8 hours | 25 gp |
| Any other common magic item | 32 hours* | 50 gp* |
*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

### Crafting Complications
If the DM is using the crafting rules in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* for items that aren't common, the creation process can involve complications. Assume there's a 10 percent chance of a complication arising for every five workweeks (25 days) spent on crafting the item. *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* presents a number of possible complications, or you can use the Eberron Crafting Complications table.

##### Eberron Crafting Complications
| d6 | Complication |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | House Cannith or another dragonmarked house takes an interest in your work. Do they view you as a threat, or are they impressed by your techniques? |
| 2 | A mishap creates a temporary manifest zone (see "*The Planes of Existence*" in *chapter 4* for information on manifest zones). |
| 3 | You need to acquire an additional rare component to complete your work. Time for adventure! |
| 4 | The shifting balance of the planes interferes with your work; you must wait for the current planar alignment to change. This delays your work by 2d6 days. |
| 5 | Your efforts draw the attention of the Aurum, the Chamber, the Emerald Claw, or the Lords of Dust. |
| 6 | Your item becomes sentient (see chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for rules on sentient items). |

# Friends and Foes
Even as the Five Nations slowly recover from the Last War, rumors spread of the alien daelkyr, the Emerald Claw, **the Lord of Blades**, and other threats growing in power across the world. This chapter provides stat blocks for many of the creatures that can play a role in an Eberron campaign, including enemies that might overrun a town, powerful entities threatening all Khorvaire, and NPCs that can serve as either friends or foes.

The chapter's monsters appear first in a bestiary. They're followed by a collection of generic NPCs—various people who can populate your Eberron adventures.

Remember that few intelligent creatures in Eberron are inherently evil. Even dragons, which on other worlds are associated with certain alignments, choose their own paths. The adventure ideas and encounter tables in chapter 4 offer abundant examples of monsters behaving in ways that aren't traditionally monstrous.

## Daelkyr
The daelkyr are the lords of madness and the emissaries of Xoriat, who invaded Eberron with a host of mind flayers, beholders, and other foul aberrations. Wherever they walked, the daelkyr reshaped the world in their image, sowing madness and creating monsters. They fused goblins together to create the gibbering dolgrims and crafted the blind dolgaunts from hobgoblin stock.

The goblinoid champions of Dhakaan fought fiercely. But in the end, it was the orc Gatekeeper druids who closed the portals to Xoriat and drove the daelkyr into Khyber. The Gatekeepers crafted seals to hold both the power of Xoriat and the daelkyr at bay, and as long as those seals remain intact, the lords of madness can't rise from the depths. Today, those seals are thousands of years old and the Gatekeepers are all but forgotten. Mind flayers scheme in the sewers of Sharn, and cultists beseech beholder priests for the blessings of **Belashyrra**, the Lord of Eyes. And in the shadows of Khyber, the daelkyr are waiting.

> ##### The Six Daelkyr
>Six daelkyr are known on Eberron through their cults and legends: **Belashyrra** and **Dyrrn**, who are detailed in this chapter, and the four described below. Other daelkyr surely lurk in the depths of Khyber.
>
>***Avassh.*** The Twister of Roots devotes its attentions to plants. Avassh is said to be the source of sham bling mounds and myconids, but any unnatural and deadly vegetation might be its work.

>***Kyrzin.*** The cults of the Prince of Slime are based in the Shadow Marches and are infamous for cultivating gibbering beasts. Kyrzin creates sentient slimes that can enter humanoid bodies. In some tales, these creatures control their hosts, while in others, they are parasites that burn their way out of the body when it's time to strike.

>***Orlassk.*** The Master of Stone is said to have created basilisks, medusas, gorgons, cockatrices, and other monstrosities and aberrations with the power of petrification. Orlassk's citadel is carved into the body of a gargantuan gargoyle that roams the chasms of Khyber.

>***Valaara.*** The Crawling Queen works its will on insects, arachnids, and other vermin. Swarms with malign sentience, worms that consume victims from within, cultists that slowly become insects—all of these delight Valaara.

***Held Loosely in Space.*** The daelkyr have lairs within Khyber, but these are no mere caverns. Each daelkyr's domain is a demiplane reflecting the twisted vision of its master. These realms are connected to the surface by tunnels and chasms, but they defy conventional geography. Passages to **Belashyrra**'s domain can be found in the Shadow Marches, but tunnels also connect its realm to Xen'drik. Adventurers can potentially cross great distances quickly by passing through a daelkyr's domain.

***Unfathomable Evil.*** The daelkyr are utterly alien, and their physical forms can't be fully perceived by mortals. Viewers perceive the same general impression of a daelkyr, but the details vary in ways that can't be controlled. For example, **Belashyrra** might appear as a female humanoid surrounded by floating eyes to some viewers, while other viewers see a haggard male elf.

> ##### Characters with Ties to the Daelkyr
>Player characters might manifest connections to the daelkyr in many ways. The Great Old One warlock patron is an excellent match to **Belashyrra** or **Dyrrn**, but other classes can just as easily reflect a connection to this darkness. For example, a barbarian's rage might be seen as a form of daelkyr-induced madness, or a sorcerer's Sorcerous Origin could be the result of a daelkyr experiment.
>
>When a character has a tie to a daelkyr, consider whether that tie was chosen or thrust upon them. Is the character a cultist who embraces their dark path, believing that a world transformed by the daelkyr will be a better place? Or is the character a victim of the daelkyr, consumed by the fear of what they might become?
>
>The touch of the daelkyr might be purely mental, or it might be accompanied by a physical transformation. A barbarian touched by **Belashyrra** might serve as an eye of the All-Seer but remain physically unchanged, even as a barbarian tied to **Dyrrn** takes on aberrant features while raging. When a warlock character gains the Devil's Sight invocation, they might literally gain the fiery red eyes of a devil.
>

### Spawn of the Daelkyr
Most of the aberrations on Eberron are the creations of the daelkyr. The daelkyr are masters of flesh-shaping, and they altered existing life forms—often beyond recognition—to create soldiers for their wars against the peoples of Khorvaire.

When a character faces a creature twisted by the daelkyr—an aberration or another creature bearing a daelkyr's corruption—consider rolling on the Daelkyr Modifications table to add strange cosmetic details to the creature.

##### Daelkyr Modifications
| d10 | Modification |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The creature is fused with another creature or object. |
| 2 | The creature has additional eyes, or its existing eyes are replaced with the eyes of a different creature. |
| 3 | The creature produces eerie music instead of speech. |
| 4 | The creature's skin has an unusual texture or color. |
| 5 | The creature's hair is replaced by spines or tentacles. |
| 6 | The creature's flesh is transparent. |
| 7 | The creature has extra limbs. |
| 8 | The creature is bioluminescent. |
| 9 | The creature has an additional head. |
| 10 | The creature sheds its skin every 60 days. |

#### Beholders
Beholders served as the living artillery of the daelkyr forces, shattering hobgoblin armies with their deadly eye rays. When the Gatekeepers drove back and imprisoned the daelkyr, most of the beholders were driven into Khyber along with their creators.

Today, beholders are solitary, egocentric creatures. Some have remained among the daelkyr and dolgaunts (presented later in this chapter), while others have accumulated their own followings among the Cults of the Dragon Below. A few have abandoned the path of aggression in favor of solitary philosophy and reflection. A beholder philosopher might manipulate events in a humanoid city not to gain power or wealth, but to stimulate and then study a particular social or economic situation.

#### Doppelgangers
The daelkyr **Dyrrn** the Corruptor enhanced the latent psychic abilities of changelings to develop doppelgangers, while implanting a desire to cause chaos in the communities around them.—even when there's no benefit in it for the doppelganger. Some doppelgangers, driven by visions from the daelkyr, can be found working with the Cults of the Dragon Below or fighting alongside aberrations in Khyber. Others operate alone.

#### Lycanthropes
Many people believe that shifters are descended from lycanthropes, but shifter druids often assert the opposite—that the abilities of the shifters are a gift from Eberron or Lamannia, but the gift was corrupted by the daelkyr to create the curse of lycanthropy.

Whatever the origin of lycanthropy, in the ninth century YK, the power of the curse surged dramatically, and all lycanthropes were drawn toward evil. The Church of the Silver Flame engaged in a long crusade to defend civilization from this brutal scourge, eventually all but eradicating lycanthropy from the Five Nations. The lycanthropes that survived hid in dark places, deep within the woods of the Eldeen Reaches and Droaam.

The common people of Khorvaire still see lycanthropes as a dire threat. Most folks don't understand that good-aligned lycanthropes exist.

#### Mind Flayers
The illithids of Eberron are the creations of the daelkyr **Dyrrn** the Corruptor. Most mind flayers on Eberron dwell in Khyber with their daelkyr masters, commanding cities of dolgaunts and dolgrims. A few can be found on the surface, working with the Cults of the Dragon Below or pursuing their own enigmatic goals. The mind flayers often seem to pursue reopening the gates to Xoriat with more urgency than the daelkyr themselves do. The immortal daelkyr can afford to wait for another ten thousand years; the illithids aren't so patient.

## Living Spells
Of all the anomalies that emerged from the magical cataclysm that created the Mournland, the appearance of living spells might be the most mysterious. In some unknown fashion, the magical energy unleashed during the Last War caused spell effects to take on sentience. A living spell appears much like a normal spell effect, except that its magical energy endures indefinitely.

Living spells haunt the Mournland and other areas blasted by the Last War, somehow subsisting on ambient magical energy as they writhe and across the landscape. Though they have no need for sustenance, they attack any creatures they come into contact with, lashing out indiscriminately with their corrupted magic.

### Customizing a Living Spell
Living spells come in many varieties; the stat blocks here are three examples. Living spells most often manifest from evocation and conjuration spells. To make a living spell from a different spell, choose a damage-dealing evocation or conjuration spell from the wizard spell list of up to 5th level. Then consult the Living Spell Customization table to see which stat block to customize, based on the chosen spell's level.

##### Living Spell Customization
| Spell Level | Stat Block to Customize |
|:---:|---|
| 1–2 | Living burning hands |
| 3–4 | Living lightning bolt |
| 5 | Living cloudkill |

Now make the following changes to that stat block:

**Damage Immunity**. Replace the living spell's damage immunity with immunity to the type (or types) of damage dealt by the chosen spell.

**Magical Strike**. Replace the damage that Magical Strike deals with one type of damage dealt by the chosen spell.

**Spell Mimicry**. Replace the effect of Spell Mimicry with the effect of the chosen spell. If that spell requires a saving throw, use spell save DC from the replaced spell, and if the spell involves an attack roll, use the attack bonus from the living spell's Magical Strike.

For example, if you turn *fireball* (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell, customize the **living lightning bolt**. The living fireball has immunity to fire damage, instead of lightning damage; deals fire damage with its Magical Strike; and replicates *fireball* with Spell Mimicry.
