# Heliod

- **Alignment**: Lawful Good
- **Domains**: Light
- **Pantheon**: Theros

Heliod is the radiant god of the sun. According to myth, he ensures that the sun rises every day to provide light and warmth to the world. Every inhabitant of Theros acknowledges his dominant presence, and nearly everyone at least pays lip service to the idea of giving him worship and honor.

Pride and self-assurance radiate from Heliod as light floods from the sun. He is cheerful and sociable, enjoying the company of others and forming bonds easily. His friendship can be as easily lost, though, turning him from ally to enemy as the consequence of a single misstep or perceived betrayal.

Heliod has appeared to mortals in a variety of forms, but he prefers the appearance of a sun-bronzed male human in his forties, dressed in a flowing tunic of golden cloth. His profile is noble, highlighted by a strong chin and a short beard, and he boasts the broad chest of a perfectly fit athlete. His hair is glossy black, and his head is crowned with a golden wreath. He is also fond of appearing as a brilliant white pegasus or a radiant golden stag. In any guise, he looks lit by the sun, even when he travels across the night sky.

## Heliod's Influence

Heliod personifies the light of day, and by extension, he is associated with many metaphorical aspects of the sun's circuit.

As the sun rises without fail every morning, so Heliod values faithfulness in oaths and bonds. Courtroom testimony and marriage vows are sworn on his name, for he can't tolerate the breaking of a solemn promise. He is the arbiter of morality, virtue, and honor.

The sun's nightly descent into darkness symbolizes bravery and self-sacrifice—the willingness to endure the horrors of the dark for the sake of others. Those who protect innocents in his name receive Heliod's favor.

As sunlight casts out darkness, Heliod's justice casts out chaos and lawlessness. He is the god of the laws that govern society and the laws that punish the wicked. He is interested not only in punitive justice, but also in the establishment of fair and equitable relationships among people and gods, in service to the common good. He also takes an interest in the bonds of family—the relationships that tie people most closely to each other.

### Heliod's Goals

In Heliod's mind, he is the ruler of the gods, and he wants merely for his rightful place to be recognized. He imagines Nyx rebuilt as his personal palace, where all can witness him in his glory. He considers himself a kind and beneficent ruler—a benign autocrat, not a tyrant—and he doesn't expect abject servility from anyone, god or mortal. He just wants everyone to defer to his will and carry out his orders. He believes that his decisions are always just and right, and that if his sovereignty were properly respected, there would be peace and order in Nyx and the mortal world alike.

### Divine Relationships

Heliod's repeated attempts to establish himself as the ruler of the pantheon anger Erebos and Purphoros, who both have a degree of the arrogance he demonstrates.

Thassa and Nylea, by contrast, aren't bothered by his efforts because they see themselves as being safely outside his reach. He could declare himself the ruler of the pantheon, they reason, but his dictates can't alter the rhythms of the sea and the cycles of nature. Thassa and Nylea will continue as they are, as they always have been, whatever squabbles their brothers might have.

Ephara, Karametra, and Iroas are closely aligned with Heliod in attitude and philosophy. In some ways, these three gods represent the principles and the abstract nature of Heliod made tangible and concrete through the lives of mortals. Heliod represents a divine, natural, moral law; Ephara gives those laws a concrete manifestation by establishing mortal society in the poleis. Heliod controls the radiant sun that makes the natural world flourish; Karametra brings the interplay of light and nature to life for mortals in the practice of agriculture. And while Heliod stands for justice, Iroas actually fights for it, taking up arms against brutality and injustice in defense of what is good and right.

Heliod hates and fears Erebos, his dark twin and his shadow. He views the god of the dead as a pathetic liar and coward who wallows in self-pity in his exile.

Heliod is also plagued by a nagging suspicion that the true ruler of the pantheon is Kruphix, a mysterious being who is capable of sealing the borders between the mortal world and the divine realm of Nyx. Kruphix is perhaps the only being who can impose limits on the other gods' actions, which makes Heliod resent and fear the god of horizons.

## Worshiping Heliod

The brilliance of Heliod's sun is impossible to ignore. Thus, virtually everyone on Theros pays at least grudging respect to the sun god in forms of worship that range from simple gestures to days-long celebrations.

Some families, particularly in the polis of Meletis, follow a practice of bowing in the direction of dawn's first light—or winking, in a gesture of respect for the sun god's luminous "eye." More dedicated worshipers offer short litanies at dawn, noon, and dusk, acknowledging the sun's passage across the sky.

> **Battle with Purphoros.** In his desire to establish himself as the leader of the pantheon, Heliod attempted to commission Purphoros to rebuild Nyx in Heliod's image. Angered by Heliod's claim to rulership, Purphoros forged the sword Godsend to fight Heliod. As their conflict raged, Purphoros's sword cut the fabric of Nyx, opening the boundary between the realms of gods and mortals. As a result, the hydra Polukranos fell to the mortal world, but Heliod and Nylea joined forces to bind the hydra in the Nessian Wood. Years later, the hydra broke free of its bonds, and Heliod chose a mortal, Elspeth Tirel, to slay the hydra as his champion—using a spear called Godsend, forged from Purphoros's sword.

> - **Birth of Erebos.** Some myths claim that Heliod was the first of the gods, though most people believe that distinction belongs to Kruphix. These myths also say that when the light of Heliod's own sun fell on him, Heliod saw his shadow and feared it. He banished the shadow to the land beyond the Rivers That Ring the World, and it became Erebos, god of the dead and ruler of the Underworld.
> - **Origin of the Catoblepas.** When a herder boasted that his cattle were the finest in Theros because Heliod and Nylea had created them, the gods grew angry at this falsehood. Heliod persuaded Mogis to curse the cattle, transforming them into the first catoblepases. As a result, many animal breeders prove excessively modest to this day, with humble-boasts being common and well understood among both buyers and sellers. Livestock that are "as Heliod intended" or "praiseless beasts" might be considered second to none.
> - **Road to the Sun.** After a life in Heliod's service, the aged oracle Solsemon departed on a final pilgrimage: setting forth to visit the sun. Day after day he journeyed east, seeking the lands from which the sun rose. He journeyed far and was mocked everywhere people learned of his quest. Worse, his sight grew ever weaker as he spent days staring at the sun. Yet still he traveled on. Even when blindness claimed Solsemon's sight, the oracle continued undaunted. Finally, one day, Solsemon found a warm, calm place. There, a powerful voice he'd heard in his dreams welcomed him to his journey's end. Praising Heliod, the oracle took his rest, and after several long, contented hours, peacefully died. Ever since, the tale of Solsemon has been argued as both a parable of determination and a warning not to pursue that which is divine.
> 
> **Spear of Heliod.** Heliod wields the spear [Khrusor](/compendium/items/khrusor-spear-of-heliod-mot.md), which can strike any point on Theros, even in the depths of the Underworld. One tale describes how a wrathful Heliod used his spear to smite a human polis whose people angered him with their hubris: the entire city of Olantin sunk beneath the sea when Heliod struck it with his spear.

## Heliod's Champions

### Alignment

Usually lawful, often good

### Suggested Classes

Cleric, fighter, monk, paladin

### Suggested Cleric Domains

Light

### Suggested Backgrounds

Acolyte, athlete, noble, soldier

Champions of Heliod are typically either exemplars of light, law, and truth or conflicted heroes motivated by revenge and sworn vows. Most can't imagine serving those they consider lesser gods.

### Heliod's Favor

Heliod seeks out champions in the mortal world because he believes that a great champion reflects well on him. The ruler of the gods, as he imagines himself, should have champions who represent the best of mortals.

That said, the reason for his initial interest in a champion isn't always obvious. What made the sun god turn his attention to you? What sets you apart from the masses of people who offer him prayers and sacrifice? What made him think you would be a good champion? The Heliod's Favor table offers a handful of suggestions.

Heliod can be a fickle god, but once you have devoted yourself to him as a champion, he will not desert you—as long as you remain faithful and your actions continue to reflect well on him.

**Heliod's Favor**

| dice: d6 | Circumstance |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | You were born at noon on the summer solstice—perhaps even in the midst of Heliod's great feast. |
| 2 | One of your parents is also a champion of Heliod. |
| 3 | You once rescued a pegasus that was trapped in a net, demonstrating your courage and your respect for this sacred creature. |
| 4 | You proved your mettle in a dramatic contest of strength, charisma, or a similar quality. |
| 5 | Calling on Heliod to witness you, you swore an oath to end some great evil. |
| 6 | You have no idea why Heliod showed interest in you, and you might sometimes wish he hadn't. |

### Devotion to Heliod

Following Heliod means devoting yourself to the cause of law and justice. In fact, champions of Heliod are sometimes more constant in their pursuit of those ideals than the god himself, who can be emotional and short-tempered. As a follower of Heliod, consider the ideals on the Heliod's Ideals table as alternatives to those suggested for your background.

**Heliod's Ideals**

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Devotion. My devotion to my god is more important to me than what he stands for. (Any) |
| 2 | Honor. I behave nobly and always keep my promises. (Lawful) |
| 3 | Protection. I face the horrors of the darkness so the common people don't have to. (Good) |
| 4 | Enforcement. Those who violate the laws that hold civilization together must be punished. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Justice. The purpose of law is to establish fair and equitable relationships among people and gods. (Lawful and good) |
| 6 | Kinship. It's essential to preserve the bonds of family—my own family first, and others after. (Lawful) |
