Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isn't being worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it impacts against a solid surface.

When the object strikes something, the object and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage.
