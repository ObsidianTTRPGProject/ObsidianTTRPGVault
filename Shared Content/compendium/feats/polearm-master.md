# Polearm Master
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 168*  

You can keep your enemies at bay with reach weapons. You gain the following benefits:

- When you take the Attack action and attack with only a [glaive](/compendium/items/glaive.md), [halberd](/compendium/items/halberd.md), [quarterstaff](/compendium/items/quarterstaff.md), or [spear](/compendium/items/spear.md), you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon; this attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this attack is a d4, and the attack deals bludgeoning damage.
- While you are wielding a [glaive](/compendium/items/glaive.md), [halberd](/compendium/items/halberd.md), [pike](/compendium/items/pike.md), [quarterstaff](/compendium/items/quarterstaff.md), or [spear](/compendium/items/spear.md), other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter the reach you have with that weapon.
