***Prerequisites*** Gnome (Deep)

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [nondetection](/compendium/spells/nondetection.md) on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [blindness/deafness](/compendium/spells/blindness-deafness.md), [blur](/compendium/spells/blur.md), and [disguise self](/compendium/spells/disguise-self.md). You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.
