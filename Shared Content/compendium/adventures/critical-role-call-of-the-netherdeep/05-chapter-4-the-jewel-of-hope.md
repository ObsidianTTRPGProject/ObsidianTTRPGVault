# Chapter 4: The Jewel of Hope
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep* 

The gloom of Bazzoxan gives way to the sunlight and warm winds of Marquet as the characters arrive in the metropolis of Ank'Harel. While they get their bearings in a new city on a new continent, the characters discover potential allies among the factions of the city and plumb the mystery of the Apotheon, an investigation that culminates in an expedition into the sunken city beneath Ank'Harel's foundations.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter has three main parts:

### Arrival in Ank'Harel

This section describes the ways in which the characters enter the city.

### Ank'Harel Gazetteer

The gazetteer is a district-by-district description of Ank'Harel that you can use to bring the city to life. Use it to improvise situations as the characters move from place to place or engage in self-directed side quests.

- **Faction Story Tracks..** Each of the three major factions that the characters can join has an episodic story track that details how the characters can advance the cause of that faction. These sections consist of "What Lies Beneath" (for the Allegiance of Allsight), "Vermilion Gambits" (for the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream), and "Knowledge Is Power" (for the Library of the Cobalt Soul).

### Faction Missions

By completing missions for their chosen faction, the characters learn about the corrupting element ruidium, the existence of the Drowned City of Cael Morrow, and the existence of the Netherdeep. The missions prompt characters to explore these regions in exchange for rewards from their faction.

Each faction's story track consists of six missions, the first three of which take place in Ank'Harel, referencing locations described in the "Ank'Harel Gazetteer" section. The fourth and fifth missions take the characters to Cael Morrow, which is described in chapter 5. The sixth mission takes place in the Netherdeep, which is detailed in chapter 6.

#### Joining a Faction

Once the characters have successfully completed the first two missions for a faction, that faction invites them to become full members. The faction won't offer them any more missions unless the characters join, because the information in the last four missions of each story track is too privileged to be revealed to common sellswords.

#### Joining Multiple Factions

Typically, a character is associated with only one faction at a time. But if the characters want to change their allegiances or engage in espionage, they can try to join a second faction.

## Rivals in Ank'Harel

The following descriptions of the rivals' actions during this chapter assume that the rivals came to Ank'Harel by means of a [teleportation tablet](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) (see appendix B):

- **Friendly Rivals..** If the rivals are predominantly friendly toward the characters, they cordially part ways after the "Arrival in Ank'Harel" scenario. The rivals find an inn that they make their semi-permanent residence, and a few days later Galsariad shares the address with the characters using a spell scroll of [sending](/compendium/spells/sending.md).
- **Indifferent Rivals..** If the rivals are predominantly indifferent toward the characters, they say farewell after the "Arrival in Ank'Harel" scenario and make no attempt to contact the characters thereafter. Rivals who are friendly with one character might still send an invitation to have lunch with that character from time to time.
- **Hostile Rivals..** If the rivals are predominantly hostile toward the characters, they part company with the characters as soon as they are able. Rivals who are still friendly with one character might sheepishly, secretively try to meet that character in the dark of night to swap stories.

### Rival Developments

The rivals are shaken by their experience in the Betrayers' Rise and have evolved in the following ways:

#### Ayo Jabe (Tier 2)

If the rivals allied with Aloysia, Ayo worries that the group has lost respect for Ayo's leadership and questions her ability to make wise decisions.

#### Dermot Wurder (Tier 2)

Dermot fears that Ayo is faltering under the responsibilities of leadership and is being overly kind in an attempt to keep her happy. He is also worried by the way she has withdrawn from their longstanding friendship.

#### Galsariad Ardyth (Tier 2)

Galsariad shuts himself off from everyone. He feels underqualified for everything his group has encountered, and he stubbornly refuses help as he continues trying to prove his worth as an adventurer.

#### Irvan Wastewalker (Tier 2)

The possibility of traveling to another continent—far removed from the Luxon beacons—terrifies Irvan. But his commitment to his companions outweighs his fear, and he chooses to stay with them and face his mortality head-on.

#### Maggie Keeneyes (Tier 2)

Always pensive, Maggie becomes even quieter after the events in the Betrayers' Rise. Her mind whirls as she tries to understand the hidden forces behind the jewel, the temple, and the factions they've encountered thus far.

## Arrival in Ank'Harel

Located thousands of miles from Wildemount, Ank'Harel is vibrant and alive, a sharp contrast to the war-scarred land the characters have left behind. Instead of the grim towers and besieged houses of Bazzoxan, the characters now find themselves in a realm of sprawling roads and towering structures humming with life, all surrounded by the golden dunes of the Marquesian desert. Ank'Harel is a bustling metropolis, and the characters will find no shortage of opportunities for adventure within its walls.

The characters arrive in Ank'Harel in one of two ways. Continue with either "Following Aloysia" or "Arriving with Prolix" below.

### Following Aloysia

Characters who use one of [Aloysia Telfan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aloysia-telfan-crcotn.md)'s [teleportation tablets](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) to travel to Ank'Harel arrive on a rooftop overlooking the Suncut Bazaar (see area T8 on the Streets of the Suncut Bazaar map). Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The chilly air and gloomy clouds of Bazzoxan are replaced by dry heat and a brilliant blue sky. You are standing on a rooftop overlooking a bazaar. Beneath your feet is a teleportation circle, from which the glow of magic is slowly subsiding.
^185

If the characters did not follow closely behind Aloysia, there is no one here to greet them. They must wander the city and find their own way around. They can purchase a map of Ank'Harel (use the poster map) for 10 gp in any shop that caters to tourists.

If the characters arrive just moments behind Aloysia, she tries to flee at the first sight of them in Ank'Harel, hoping to lose her pursuers in the Suncut Bazaar. If the characters give chase, use the ""Chases"" section and the urban chase complications in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" to determine whether Aloysia escapes. If caught, she frantically offers the characters employment with the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream. The Consortium, she says, can provide them with money, lodging, and opportunity. If the characters express interest, she offers to lead them through the Suncut Bazaar to a tavern named First Eclipse.

#### Meeting the Consortium

Though it appears to be an ordinary, well-appointed tavern, First Eclipse is the Consortium's hidden base of operations in Ank'Harel (see the "Suncut Bazaar" section). If the characters allow Aloysia to guide them here, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Aloysia leads you through the crowded tavern to a wall decorated with old cask lids. She raps her knuckles three times on a lid painted with a red crescent moon, causing a secret door in the wall behind it to open. Through the opening, you see a private storeroom filled with cabinets and corked bottles of wine in wooden racks.
^187

Aloysia leads the characters inside the storeroom, then asks them to wait while she goes to get someone. After a few minutes, she returns with one of the Consortium's leaders: Vrill the Moth, a lawful evil, elf [occult silvertongue](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-silvertongue-crcotn.md) (see appendix A).

Hailing from Wildemount's Menagerie Coast, Vrill is a white-haired elf with eyes that seem to penetrate every creature and object she looks upon. She shields herself from the sun with a floppy red hat. Though Vrill regards the characters with haughty disdain, Aloysia's recounting of events in Bazzoxan has piqued her interest enough to grant the characters a brief audience.

Vrill immediately asks the characters to show her the [Jewel of Three Prayers](/compendium/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-awakened-crcotn.md), and she returns the jewel to the characters after examining it. She correctly identifies the jewel as a Vestige of Divergence in its Awakened State and asks how the characters acquired it.

If the characters mention the vision they received from the Apotheon, Vrill's haughty demeanor changes to one of curiosity. She explains that her organization's research has turned up fragments of the ancient history of the Apotheon—a legendary figure said to have been blessed by Ruidus, the Moon of Ill Omen.

#### Developments

Vrill offers the characters a place to stay at First Eclipse until they find lodging of their own. She also gives them a map of Ank'Harel (use the poster map), then excuses herself, bidding Aloysia to follow. Before leaving the characters to their own devices, Vrill says to them, "The Consortium will be in touch again after you find your own lodgings. No need to tell us where you're staying. We will find you."

This branch of the adventure continues in "Vermilion Gambits," the story track tied to the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.

### Arriving with Prolix

If Prolix used his [teleportation tablet](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) to transport himself and the characters to Ank'Harel, the group arrives inside the Teleportation Atrium of the Crystal Chateau (area S2 on the Streets of the Sigil District map). If Question the tiefling is with them, she arrives here as well. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The chilly air and gloomy clouds of Bazzoxan are replaced by dry heat and a brilliant blue sky visible through the arched window of a magnificent building with walls of white marble. Beneath your feet is a teleportation circle, from which the glow of magic is slowly subsiding.
^18a

Prolix asks the characters if they'd be comfortable meeting with one of his superiors. If they say yes, continue with the "Meeting the Allegiance" section below. Otherwise, they are free to explore Ank'Harel and secure lodging for themselves.

#### Friends of the Cobalt Soul

If Question is present, she thanks Prolix for helping her return to Ank'Harel and tells the characters that she must inform her superiors at the Library of the Cobalt Soul about the loss of her expedition—and about the characters' involvement in Bazzoxan. "Only good things," she reassures them cheerily.

Before leaving their company, Question tells the characters that they'll be called upon in a few days' time and gives them one stone from a pair of [sending stones](/compendium/items/sending-stones.md) that they can use when that time comes. She says that her superior, Iwo Zalarre, will probably be the one to contact them through the stone. She also entrusts them with a map of Ank'Harel (use the poster map), so they can become familiar with the city during their stay. She then catches a carriage to the Guided District. This branch of the adventure continues in "Knowledge Is Power," the story track for the Library of the Cobalt Soul.

#### Meeting the Allegiance

Prolix leads the characters across the Sigil District, which features well-watered green grass and beautiful fig trees, as well as dozens of buildings. They arrive at Teres Schoolhouse, one of two universities run by the Allegiance of Allsight in Ank'Harel (see the "Sigil District" section later in the chapter).

Prolix guides the characters across the school's campus and into one of the administrative buildings:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Prolix leads you to a structure the size of a small house. The bottom half is the same brick that makes up many of the older buildings in the neighborhood, but halfway up the outside, the walls turn to delicate stonework, as if someone had built a new floor on top of an old foundation. Glittering spires of iron and crystal adorn its sloping roof, and silver lettering across the door reads, "Headmaster Alakritos."
^18d

The more charitable of the Allegiance of Allsight's two leaders is Alakritos, a neutral good, goblin [scholarly mastermind](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-mastermind-crcotn.md) (see appendix A). The headmaster is pleased to see that Prolix has returned from Bazzoxan safely and offers tea as he listens to Prolix and the characters talk.

Prolix asks the characters to recount their experiences with Aloysia in Bazzoxan. Alakritos listens to them quietly, pondering what the Jewel of Three Prayers must mean to the Consortium if it was willing to go to such lengths to obtain it.

If the characters have the jewel, Alakritos asks to examine it. He successfully identifies it as a Vestige of Divergence, noting that though it is not directly tied to any deity, it nonetheless bears the hallmarks of divine creation. If the characters mention their vision, Alakritos claims to know nothing about it, but a character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check discerns that the mention of the sunken city depicted in the vision sparked recognition in his eyes. If confronted, Alakritos admits that there are sunken ruins beneath Ank'Harel's oasis, though access to these ruins is limited to members of the Allegiance of Allsight. If pressed further, he holds up his hands and says, "All in good time. I've already said more than I ought to a group of untested hopefuls."

#### Developments

Alakritos fields questions about Ank'Harel in general (recounting information from the "Ank'Harel Gazetteer" below). When the session with the headmaster is over, Prolix offers to let the characters stay in his apartment for the night before they start to find their way around this new city. Prolix also hands them a map of Ank'Harel (use the poster map), if they haven't already received one.

A few days later, Prolix visits them at whatever new lodgings they've found and extends an invitation to undertake a mission for the Allegiance of Allsight. This branch of the adventure continues in "What Lies Beneath," the Allegiance Story Track.

## Ank'Harel Gazetteer

Ank'Harel translates to "Jewel of Hope" in the northern dialect of the Marquesian language. The city was established as an oasis trading post. A rare source of underground fresh water made this one of the few habitable locations in the vast desert.

As more travelers arrived to take part in building this metropolis, unpaved roads were upgraded to stone streets, and walls were bolstered with towers and parapets. Ank'Harel flourished, becoming a cultural melting pot of people from across the continent and some from farther away.

### Ank'Harel at a Glance

- **Population..** 293,500 (predominantly humans, orcs, and elves)
- **Leader..** J'mon Sa Ord, a lawful neutral [ancient brass dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-brass-dragon.md), helped found the city over 400 years ago and has ruled it ever since. Depending on which supposition one subscribes to, J'mon is either an archfey of the Feywild, a demigod in disguise, or multiple individuals pretending to be a single entity. J'mon is rarely seen in public, and it is extremely difficult to gain an audience with them. Because of the dragon's reclusive nature, an elderly female human named Gemeshega is Ank'Harel's Grandmaven, or acting chancellor.
- **Laws..** The laws of Ank'Harel are based on the Code of Ord. Theft, exploitation, and murder are the worst crimes, punishments for which range from life in prison to permanent exile from the city. Laws are enforced by the Hands of Ord, the city guard. Offenses for which culpability is in question or that involve particularly heinous crimes are ruled on by the judges in the Cerulean Palace and, in some cases, by J'mon Sa Ord.
- **Religion..** Worship of all Prime Deities is welcomed in Ank'Harel. Worship of the Betrayer Gods, when such activity is discovered, is punished on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of the reverence. Someone in possession of forbidden iconography is typically sentenced to a few weeks of imprisonment, but someone who conducts rites dedicated to a Betrayer God is treated more severely.
- **Neighborhoods..** The city is divided into eight districts: the Alluvium District, the Circlet Walk, the Guided District, the Ridge, the River District, the Sand-Herald District, the Sigil District, and the Suncut Bazaar.
- **Geography..** Ank'Harel lies in the center of a vast desert, nestled among clay-rich mountains. Three of these peaks have been leveled off at different elevations to form the Ridge, the Guided District, and the Cerulean Palace. Canals filled with fresh water circulate through the River District, branching outward from the nexus of the oasis.

### Lodging

The Ank'Harel Lodgings table gives examples of lodgings that are available in the city.

**Ank'Harel Lodgings**

| Lodging | Type | Lifestyle |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Back alley | Side Street | Wretched |
| Ajir's Whetstone (in the Alluvium District) | Hostel | Squalid |
| Golden Chip (in the Suncut Bazaar) | Casino | Poor |
| Harried Mongoose (in the River District) | Tavern | Modest |
| Step Aside (in the Circlet Walk) | Tavern/Inn | Comfortable |
| Lap of the Gods (in the Sand-Herald District) | Resort | Wealthy |
^ankharel-lodgings

### Major Factions

Numerous political, academic, and criminal factions are active in Ank'Harel. Driven by ambitions both apparent and unseen, these organizations and their rivalries shape the city's social and political landscape, and they offer opportunities for adventurers to rub shoulders with powerful individuals and thereby enhance their reputations.

Three of the groups have a strong interest in the Apotheon and what he represents: the Allegiance of Allsight, the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream, and the Library of the Cobalt Soul. Each of these factions has a set of missions the adventurers can undertake, which are detailed later in the chapter.

#### Allegiance of Allsight

_"To peer into the past is to illuminate the future."_

- **Headquarters..** The Crystal Chateau, a university in the Sigil District, is the Allegiance's headquarters.
- **Leader..** The Allegiance is led by two headmasters: the dour [James Cryon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/james-cryon-crcotn.md), a lawful neutral elf, who is also the head of the Crystal Chateau's program for the arcane arts; and the kindly [Gryz Alakritos](/compendium/bestiary/npc/gryz-alakritos-crcotn.md), a neutral good [goblin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md), whose infectious enthusiasm makes him the more popular of the pair. Both use the [scholarly mastermind](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-mastermind-crcotn.md) stat block (see appendix A).
- **Allies..** The Allegiance and the Library of the Cobalt Soul are staunch allies.

- **Opponents..** The Allegiance opposes the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream and the Sentinels of Memory (see "Minor Factions" later in the chapter).

The Allegiance of Allsight is an academic collective known across Marquet. Its original members came to Ank'Harel from across the continent to rebuild the robust academic tradition that defined the elves and orcs of ancient Cael Morrow.

The Allegiance of Allsight is embodied in two of Ank'Harel's academic institutions: Teres Schoolhouse, the city's largest center of education, and the Crystal Chateau, an elite school of arcane principles and the center of the Allegiance's operations. Students from anywhere in Ank'Harel are welcome at Teres Schoolhouse, but the Crystal Chateau's programs are extremely competitive, and all pupils there are required to join the Allegiance of Allsight.

In recent years, the faction's leadership has been focused on uncovering the secrets of Cael Morrow, the sunken ruins beneath the city. For decades previously, the headmasters of the Allegiance petitioned J'mon Sa Ord for permission to unseal the long-lost ruins, and finally, the city's mysterious leader relented. The opening of an entrance to the ruins infuriated the Sentinels of Memory, a minor faction whose members fanatically believe the sunken city is best left forgotten, lest some unknown terror left over from the Calamity be disturbed.

##### How to Join

Joining the Allegiance of Allsight requires one to be referred by an active member, then be reviewed and audited by the Allegiance's council of leadership prior to the issuance of a judgment on the candidate.

##### Allegiance Story Track

The series of missions offered by the Allegiance of Allsight is described in "What Lies Beneath," later in the chapter.

#### Consortium of the Vermilion Dream

_"Seek the stories others fear to know."_

- **Headquarters..** Consortium members meet in First Eclipse, a tavern in the Suncut Bazaar, and hold private conversations in a secret storeroom there.
- **Leader..** The Consortium is led by a council of five masters who all use the [occult silvertongue](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-silvertongue-crcotn.md) stat block (see appendix A). They are [Aradrine the Owl](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aradrine-the-owl-crcotn.md), a lawful neutral goliath (see the "Goliaths of Exandria" sidebar later in the chapter); Dendarron the Sun Bear, a chaotic neutral halfling; Larthul the Wolf, a chaotic evil human; Khelkur the Gull, a neutral evil dwarf; and Vrill the Moth, a lawful evil elf.
- **Allies..** The Consortium maintains a tenuous alliance with the Sentinels of Memory (see "Minor Factions" later in the chapter).
- **Opponents..** The Consortium opposes the Allegiance of Allsight and the Library of the Cobalt Soul.

This group of occult mystics has assembled a membership of like-minded souls from across Exandria. The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream focuses on studying the magic described in folklore that has been dismissed as fanciful by more "proper" institutions. The group takes its name from its foremost object of fascination: Ruidus, the ruddy moon of Exandria that is fabled to bestow ill fortune and suffering upon those who are born, enter into contracts, or begin new ventures under its baleful light.

The Consortium was founded by five influential individuals, all renowned in occult circles from across Exandria, who sought to gain wealth and prestige from their studies. The Consortium is still young, and thus all five of its founders still live. Older academic institutions such as the Allegiance of Allsight and the Library of the Cobalt Soul express concern and sometimes disdain toward the upstart Consortium and its aggressive, profit-driven attitude toward scholarship.

Due to the expensive nature of its research, the Consortium is in constant need of funding. It leans heavily on its members for such support, selling the services of its magically skilled devotees to government officials, wealthy diplomats, and other persons of means. A large portion of its income goes to support the Sentinels of Memory, the Consortium's tentative ally against the Allegiance of Allsight.

##### How to Join

The Consortium gladly welcomes any enthusiast of the strange and occult to its ranks—as long as the faction's leaders can be reasonably certain that the individual has no ulterior motives that would undermine their efforts.

##### Consortium Story Track

The series of missions offered by the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is described in "Vermilion Gambits," later in the chapter.

#### Library of the Cobalt Soul

_"Reason. Knowledge. Truth."_

- **Headquarters..** The Marquesian branch of the Library of the Cobalt Soul is based at the Temple of the Mentor—a temple of Ioun the Knowing Mentor—in the Guided District.

- **Leader..** At 29 years old, [Jamil A'alithiya](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jamil-aalithiya-crcotn.md), a chaotic good human, is the youngest [monastic high curator](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/monastic-high-curator-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) in the history of the Cobalt Soul. He is often underestimated by his contemporaries and uses that fact to his advantage.
- **Allies..** The Cobalt Soul maintains alliances with the Allegiance of Allsight and the Hands of Ord (see "Minor Factions" below).
- **Opponents..** The Cobalt Soul opposes the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.

The Library of the Cobalt Soul was founded in the heart of Wildemount centuries ago, before any of the nations that currently wage war over that land were born. Its archivists have stood strong against conflict, propaganda, and upheaval during all this time in their dogged hunt for the truth. Their mission has spread across Exandria, with advocates in various locales defying local governments in the pursuit of truth.

The Cobalt Soul founded the Temple of the Mentor in Ank'Harel nearly 150 years ago. The archivists here focus on rooting out evil in the city's civilian factions—principally the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream, whose members reportedly wield magic weapons made of some strange, red mineral the likes of which no Cobalt Soul archivist has ever seen.

The faction is wary of the Allegiance of Allsight's fascination with Cael Morrow, but as fellow academic institutions, the Allegiance of Allsight and the Cobalt Soul work together most of the time, sharing resources from their libraries.

##### How to Join

The Library of the Cobalt Soul accepts for consideration any volunteers who express interest in gathering and preserving knowledge. These volunteers are put to work as librarians, performing menial tasks such as organizing records and transcribing notes from expeditions—drudgery designed to weed out those who want to join the organization for the sake of fame and adventure. Typically, this duty lasts about six months, after which a librarian is formally inducted.

##### Cobalt Soul Story Track

The series of missions offered by the Library of the Cobalt Soul is described in "Knowledge Is Power," later in the chapter.

### Minor Factions

Other, smaller factions are important to life in Ank'Harel but take a backseat in the plot of this adventure.

#### Hands of Ord

_"By the code of Ord, we stand vigilant."_

- **Headquarters..** The city guard is based in Ord Bastion in the Sand-Herald District.
- **Leader..** Ironhand Sem, a lawful good [minotaur](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur.md), commands the Hands of Ord and oversees all military operations in Ank'Harel.
- **Allies..** The Hands of Ord and the Library of the Cobalt Soul are staunch allies.
- **Opponents..** The Hands of Ord aim to root out and destroy the Veil (see below).

Established four hundred years ago by J'mon Sa Ord, the Hands of Ord are a peacekeeping order of desert warriors who have long watched over Ank'Harel and kept the city safe and stable.

The order is governed by the code of Ord, which is the backbone of the city's legal system. Members of the Hands dedicate their lives to the city and the code, and many come from a long, respected bloodline of previous Hands. Well-appointed barracks in the Sand-Herald District provide members of the Hands with a comfortable home; places of worship; and sources of food, armor, and weapons.

Despite their best efforts, the Hands of Ord have failed to thwart the Veil, the crime syndicate that pervades Ank'Harel society.

#### Scarbearers

_"We do not break."_

- **Headquarters..** The Bowl of Judgment, an arena in the Sand-Herald District used for combat tournaments, is the Scarbearers' headquarters.
- **Leader..** Once a mercenary in his own right, Quartermaster Croog Lynn, a chaotic neutral, goliath [gladiator](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md), has now taken to running the guild in his later years (see the accompanying "Goliaths of Exandria" sidebar).
- **Allies..** None.
- **Opponents..** None.

The Scarbearers are the most famous mercenary company in Ank'Harel. Named for the scars their founders displayed to J'mon Sa Ord as proof of their service to the realm, the Scarbearers occupy an honorable position in Marquesian society. They often take high-profile jobs, such as serving as bodyguards for diplomats and protecting caravans and expeditions into the desert. The members promote themselves as a guild that respects honor and guidelines, but they often come across as brash, thuggish fighters who are out for a paycheck.

In addition to their mercenary exploits, the Scarbearers also supervise the tournaments that take place in the Bowl of Judgment.

#### Sentinels of Memory

_"Let the past die in peace."_

- **Headquarters..** The Tower of Memory in the Guided District is the meeting place for the Sentinels of Memory.
- **Leader..** Watcher Trast, a neutral, elf [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) and a former cleric of Ioun, founded the Sentinels of Memory and maintains command over the faction to this day.
- **Allies..** The Sentinels are allied with the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.
- **Opponents..** The Sentinels oppose the Allegiance of Allsight.

The Sentinels of Memory are a group of fanatics who believe the sunken city beneath Ank'Harel isn't some grand ancient wonder—it's a prison that must be kept sealed at all costs. Citing the lack of recorded history about Cael Morrow as proof that powerful forces wanted to expunge the city from memory, the Sentinels of Memory are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that no one speaks of that ill-fated city ever again.

Since they oppose the excavation of Cael Morrow, the Sentinels of Memory are constantly at odds with the Allegiance of Allsight. Though their efforts to date have mostly been political, some of their members have been connected to violent acts intended to thwart the excavation efforts.

Recently, the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream has been supplying the Sentinels of Memory with funds and agents to support the Sentinels' conflict against the Allegiance of Allsight. The Sentinels are grateful for the aid but treat the Consortium with caution, suspecting the faction has ulterior motives.

#### The Veil

_"Welcome to the other side."_

- **Headquarters..** None.
- **Leader..** Twenty-year-old Ilena Hapayhari, a chaotic evil, human [assassin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) and ruthless pirate from the western coast of Marquet, recently disposed of the Veil's old leadership. She now rules the Veil from the shadows, though only high-ranking members are privy to this knowledge.
- **Allies..** None.
- **Opponents..** The Veil opposes the Hands of Ord.

A secret network of spies, thieves, and assassins, the Veil is the largest crime syndicate in Ank'Harel. It is the chaotic counterpoint to the order of the Hands of Ord.

Not much is publicly known about the Veil; the identities and personal details of its members are kept secret even among the group, and those who let such secrets slip are often found murdered before they can be apprehended. The Veil has no permanent headquarters in the city, constantly changing bases to cover its trail.

Although the Veil doesn't play a role in this adventure, you can use this faction as an adversary in your own adventures set in Ank'Harel.

### Alluvium District

The Alluvium District is the northernmost neighborhood of Ank'Harel. Named for the rich clay mined in the cliffs that border the district, this area is a mixture of dense residential sections, sites of clay strip mining, and spacious plazas used for oral performances and artisan markets.

#### Alluvium Gardens

_Arboretum_

The arboretum known as the Alluvium Gardens is famous for the meticulous, geometric layout of its hedges and planters, mimicking the tile art of the district's ceramic masters. After a long day of hauling clay, miners often retreat to the shade of the gardens to unwind and chat with friends. At the center of the gardens is a grove of fig, apricot, and pomegranate trees, and visitors to the gardens are welcome to help themselves to any ripe fruit they can reach. The gardens also contain kurrak, a hard-to-cultivate fruit native to the jungles of Marquet that has a tough, spiny shell and soft, sweet flesh like that of a mango.

#### Opalite Forum

_Entertainment Square_

Eight pillars of iridescent glass, created from discarded sand and debris from the clay mines, ring the outside of this wide stone courtyard in the heart of the Alluvium District. The Opalite Forum is a central gathering place for district residents, often used to host festivals and holy celebrations.

The forum is also a place where storytellers from across Exandria tell their tales. During the day, children gather around the elderly chroniclers, who relate the legends of Exandria's founding and stories of the Calamity in the oral tradition of their forebears. At night, the forum is overtaken by crowds of burgeoning writers, reading their latest works aloud and, on occasion, engaging in friendly duels of poeticism and wit.

#### Sa'irah Mines

_Clay Strip Mines_

The angular ridges of the Sa'irah strip mines loom over the rest of the Alluvium District, and the cacophony of hammering and drilling fills the nearby streets almost constantly during the workday. Most of the clay harvested here is used for the construction and repair of buildings. Some of it is worked by artisans who have perfected the art of blending and firing the clay, creating vibrantly colored mosaic tiles and other ceramic works.

The quarry is run by a gruff, middle-aged miner named Zala Keencutter, a neutral, tiefling [thug](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md). Though he puts up an abrasive facade, Zala has a shy and empathetic soul, and he wants dearly to work up the courage to read his prose writings at the Opalite Forum some evening.

### Cerulean Palace

The purple and blue spires of the Cerulean Palace reflect the sun's light off their edges like a sun-dappled waterfall. Most citizens are familiar only with the palace's ornate exterior, covered with glittering designs of lapis lazuli and turquoise with brass accents. The inside of the palace, where only those with official business are typically allowed, contains chambers used for deliberation, debate, and judgment regarding legal matters. Beneath the palace lies a labyrinthine dungeon called the Oblag, also known as the Scarlet Oubliette.

At the center of the palace complex is the Chamber of Judgment. Intricate tilework covers the outer surface of the chamber. The inside is dimly illuminated by sunlight that shines through the translucent panes of bluish crystal that make up the roof. On a raised stone dais sits an intricately carved bronze throne studded with sapphires—the Seat of J'mon Sa Ord, said to be a duplicate of the one the leader uses in their personal quarters at the top of the palace's highest tower. In the Chamber of Judgment, perpetrators of the most terrible crimes are brought to justice. J'mon Sa Ord descends to occupy the seat while presiding over these hearings and then personally delivers the verdict.

### The Circlet Walk

The Circlet Walk is primarily a residential district, though taverns and other places of commerce can be found here as well. The district is so packed with buildings that it's customary for people to travel through the district by hopping from rooftop to rooftop rather than navigating the narrow roads.

#### Lyrean Linen

_Front for the Black Market_

At first glance, Lyrean Linen looks like any other cloth-dyeing establishment, with long sheets of fabric hanging off every rafter and vats of colored liquid arrayed across the front of the shop. Asking for cloth dyed "whitestone green" gives a customer access to the store's other wares: a dangerous narcotic called suude and other forbidden concoctions sold on the black market.

The shop is run by Bas and Kovra Lyrean, twin sisters who are neutral evil, half-elf [bandits](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md). Originally alchemists by trade, they use their knowledge to brew magic potions deemed by the Hands of Ord to be too dangerous for public consumption.

#### Step Aside

_Inn and Tavern_

This cozy establishment is a local favorite, known for its delicious food and a cheery atmosphere that invites folks to "step aside" from their daily troubles and rest a while. Desert flowers flourish in planters that decorate the tavern's windowsills and bar, and the upstairs rooms are redolent with the scents of garlic rice and fried meats wafting up from the kitchen. On the most sweltering days, the tavern offers its signature dessert: haluh, a dish from the southwestern Marquesian coast consisting of shaved ice and sweet milk topped with jackfruit or kurrak, coconut strips, and sweet purple yam.

The place is run by two former mercenaries: Irawan, a lawful good, elf [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md), and his husband Calinao, a neutral good, elf [druid](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md). Unbeknownst to many, Irawan and Calinao were among the original Scarbearers who came to Ank'Harel during the city's nascent years and defiantly showed to J'mon Sa Ord the scars they earned during their defense of the realm. The couple has long since retired from mercenary life, but they serve the people of the city in other ways. If the phrase "Pardon my steps as I pass through" is whispered to either Irawan or Calinao, they'll lead the individual to a safe house beneath the tavern, where the beneficiary is welcome to stay until other arrangements can be made.

### Guided District

The Guided District contains several houses of worship, with each of the Prime Deities represented. The district's architecture is more ornamental than in other areas of the city; many temples are adorned with intricate mosaics and crowned by minarets with gilded spires.

The few vagabonds to be found in Ank'Harel frequent the alleys in this district, where many temples send representatives to feed and clothe the downtrodden. The Hands of Ord also maintain a notable presence here.

#### Blessing Well

_Holy Site_

At the heart of the Guided District is a concave stone courtyard known as the Blessing Well. A line of alabaster tiles spirals down to the center of the plaza, ending at the well itself, whose deep blue bricks are speckled with silver in a representation of the night sky.

The Blessing Well is not dedicated to a deity and instead is a public space for anyone in Ank'Harel who seeks spiritual guidance. On many occasions, an individual has been lowered into the well, away from the bright lights and bustle of the city, to calm their thoughts and commune with the divine; they emerge hours later, eyes gleaming with renewed purpose as they savor the divine vision they experienced while in the well's depths.

The water of the well is separate from that in the city canals and is used only in holy ceremonies. Drinking the well's water bestows a terrible divine curse upon the drinker that even the most potent mortal magic can't undo.

#### Crossings of Eventide

_Necropolis_

Over two hundred feet high, the Crossings of Eventide are a series of tombs carved into the cliffs that border the Guided District. Reliefs depicting the most important deeds of the tombs' occupants adorn the spaces between the stone slabs that seal the graves. At sunset, crystal braziers that hang throughout the necropolis catch the fading light, painting the nearby cliffside in vibrant hues of pink, orange, and purple.

At the base of the cliff rests a small temple dedicated to the Matron of Death. In Ank'Harel (and in much of Marquet at large), the god of death and fate is perceived differently from how she is regarded in the lands of Wildemount, Tal'Dorei, and Issylra. Bereft of her moniker "the Raven Queen," here the god is associated with twilight, inevitability, and the passage of time, and she presides over the transition between life and death. Some Marquesian sects refer to her as the "Duskmaven," portraying her as a keen-eyed vulture with a golden funerary mask and feathers whose colors range from sunset hues to midnight black.

#### Temple of the Mentor

_Temple to Ioun and Headquarters of the Cobalt Soul_

A ceramic mosaic of three open eyes framed in cobalt blue crowns the entrance to the Temple of the Mentor. Dedicated to Ioun, the temple is more a library than a hall of worship, and it doubles as the base of operations for the Marquesian branch of the Library of the Cobalt Soul. Shelves line the walls of the temple's sanctuary, all filled near to capacity with meticulously catalogued tomes, scrolls, and periodicals that are available for public inspection.

Staircases lead up from the sanctuary to the residents' apartments and the scriptorium, and up farther to the quarters of the Cobalt Soul's higher-ranking members. Stairs lead down from the sanctuary to a locked door opened with a key held only by select individuals and the Cobalt Soul's high curator. Behind this door is the Cobalt Soul's vast subterranean archive, containing all sorts of esoteric knowledge that is purposely kept away from the public. The entire expanse is lit by [continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md) spells.

At the high curator's behest, a sardonic monk named Iwo Zalarre, a chaotic good, half-orc [monastic operative](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/monastic-operative-crcotn.md) (see appendix A), oversees all visitors to the public archives and registers all requests for access to the private archive. Though just as dedicated to Ioun's service as any other member of the Cobalt Soul, Iwo is eager to get out of the temple and take part in a challenging mission.

#### Tower of Memory

_Headquarters of the Sentinels of Memory_

Situated on the far western side of the Guided District, the octagonal Tower of Memory juts out of the ground at a slightly crooked angle. The building was slated for demolition when the founder of the Sentinels of Memory, Watcher Trast, purchased it to use as a home for his small but zealous group of followers. The Sentinels have since spent little time repairing the structure, so cracks still show between the ivory bricks, and the wooden floorboards creak with every step.

Watcher Byron, a lawful evil, gnome [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md), oversees most of the sentinels' operations for Watcher Trast and rarely leaves the Tower of Memory. Gentle of voice but volatile of temper, Byron has grown increasingly impatient with his faction's political strategy and has begun to plot more aggressive ways of hampering the Allegiance of Allsight's excavation of Cael Morrow. Though he would never admit it, Byron secretly longs to see the wonders of Cael Morrow for himself.

### The Ridge

Sitting atop one of the city's three plateaus, the Ridge is Ank'Harel's industrial district. Its streets are crowded with smithies, foundries, shipyards, and warehouses.

#### Alsfarin Union Shipyard

_Skyship Conglomerate_

The foremost producer of skyships in Exandria, the Alsfarin Union, has its base of operations in Ank'Harel. Its shipyard, thundering with the peal of hammers and glowing with arcane energy when work is under way, is off limits to anyone except employees. The Alsfarin Union protects its supply of brumestone—the enchanted crystal that magically holds skyships aloft—with an iron fist.

Since all skyships in operation across Exandria must come to the shipyard once a year for maintenance and repair, the area near the shipyard has become a hodgepodge of cultures from around the world. Curious folks can purchase iconic headwear from Whitestone in Tal'Dorei at the Lord Percy Haberdashery (a name not endorsed by Lord Percival de Rolo III of Whitestone), then patronize a cart selling pastries from Port Damali in Wildemount and indulge in a mug of ale brewed in Vasselheim in distant Issylra, all in the same city block.

#### Sunfire Forge

_Smithy_

Built partially into the side of the mountain that borders the north side of the district, the Sunfire Forge is the premier blacksmith and weapons manufacturer in Ank'Harel. Its name comes from the forge's unique power source: liquid sunlight, harvested from the iridescent crystals lining its roof. The consistent heat of this concentrated form of energy allows for the creation of fine metalwork that incorporates fragile components such as arcane minerals and gem dust. Two glowing streams of sunfire cascade down the sides of the forge's pitched roof before coming to rest in stone reservoirs, where the liquid is stored before being funneled into the forge.

The Sunfire Forge is under the control of Rohaya Tak, a neutral good, half-elf [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md), who inherited the business from her mother two decades ago. An innovative metalworker, Rohaya combines her smithcraft with shrewd business intuition. In addition to crafting blades and tools, Rohaya uses the forge to produce cannons for use on sailing ships and skyships, modeled after the bronze cannons of her family's homeland in southern Marquet.

### River District

Its atmosphere permeated by the smell of wet earth, the River District is where most of the city's farming is done. Strips of irrigated cropland are intermingled with newer hydroponic farms, and in place of roads, canals connect the subdivisions of the district. Most folks traverse the canals of the River District in skiffs and lightweight canoes.

#### Life Dome

_Nexus of the Canals_

This glass dome crowns the source of water in Ank'Harel: the oasis around which the city was built. All the canals in the River District originate from the Life Dome, and the structure is a center of celebration and a monument to the city's history. At night, the inside of the dome is magically lit by drifting orbs of blue and green luminescence, painting the nearby area in a display of colored light.

The Life Dome also serves an important agricultural purpose. Because the water that fills Ank'Harel's oasis flows not from a natural source but from underground caverns created by the acts of the gods, the water level frequently fluctuates. The water can surge forth or slow to a trickle, threatening to bring about floods or dry spells, respectively. To counteract this problem, the Life Dome instantly transmutes any water that exceeds the accepted level into vapor and stores it in the seams of the dome. When the water level drops, the stored vapor is transmuted back into liquid and fed into the irrigation canals.

The Allegiance of Allsight scholar Carliale Kroogan, a neutral good, gnome [scholarly excavator](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-excavator-crcotn.md) (see appendix A), is currently the chief supervisor for the Life Dome. Lonely and a bit of a chatterbox, Carliale is always ready to chat about arcane theory with any individual who comes his way.

#### Old Man Kruuk's

_Bakery and Fence for Stolen Goods_

Old Man Kruuk, a neutral, half-orc [bandit captain](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md), is a mediocre baker; his pitas are tough and chewy, and the caramel of his baklava is bitter and burned. Kruuk's talent lies in his true vocation as a fence for stolen goods. After an individual gains his trust, he drops his bumbling baker facade and reveals himself to be an excellent businessperson, able to sweet-talk even the most uncompromising thieves into a favorable deal.

The scope of Old Man Kruuk's operation far exceeds what anyone might suspect—or even what he should be capable of as a single individual. Some rumormongers suggest that Kruuk is a high-ranking member of the Veil, but no one has verified this supposition.

#### Steam Gardens

_Arboretum and Bathhouse_

The most luxurious of Ank'Harel's arboretums, the Steam Gardens are popular because they include a bathhouse and spa. Water from the canals is fed into the gardens' magically fueled hot springs, which bubble as they release massaging jets of water.

An hour's visit at the most exclusive spa costs 5 gp. Characters who spend 8 hours eating, luxuriating, and relaxing in the spa awaken the next morning with 1d10 "temporary hit points" that last for the next 24 hours, in addition to the usual benefits of finishing a long rest.

### Sand-Herald District

The center of military activity and law enforcement in Ank'Harel, the Sand-Herald District houses the headquarters of the Hands of Ord. The organization's stronghold is a major feature of the district, dwarfed only by the Cerulean Palace.

The residences in the Sand-Herald District are occupied mostly by wealthy folk: powerful merchants, decorated mercenaries who have earned riches by winning tournaments in the Bowl of Judgment, and local celebrities of song and stage. The district is also the site of Ank'Harel's skyport.

#### Bowl of Judgment

_Combat Tournament Arena_

On the north side of the Sand-Herald District, an immense circular depression has been carved into the ground. The Bowl of Judgment is where warriors are made into legends. Sporting tournaments are held here on a regular basis, highlighted by a yearly event known as the Grand Tournament. At each competition, spectators wager on who will be the winner of the upcoming match. Anyone who can pay the entry fee of 20 gp can sign up to compete. Although most bouts end with one participant yielding or falling [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious), death is always a possible outcome in the Bowl of Judgment.

Sheed Caltor, a chaotic neutral, orc noble, is the suave ringmaster of the Bowl. Sheed is mostly concerned with his image, his income, and his status among the upper crust of Ank'Harel.

#### Indala Skyport

_Skyship Port_

Skyship travel is undertaken primarily by those who want to avoid the time and danger of an ocean voyage or a long trek through the desert—and who can afford the cost of such transportation. The Indala Skyport dates to the earliest days of skyship travel. Its central terminal is world-famous for its elaborate stained-glass ceiling, which depicts a mosaic of the surface of Exandria with glowing dots moving across it, representing each skyship the Alsfarin Union currently has in flight.

Outbound flights from the Indala Skyport connect to other major skyports in Exandria, including Vasselheim in Issylra, Port Damali in Wildemount, and Emon and Whitestone in Tal'Dorei.

#### Ord Bastion

_Headquarters of the Hands of Ord_

In contrast to the heavily embellished architecture of the Cerulean Palace, the towering walls of Ord Bastion are built from sturdy mud bricks, undecorated except for simple, angular carvings that adorn the tops of the building's watchtowers.

Ord Bastion serves principally as the barracks and training center for the members of the Hands of Ord, but since membership in the Hands is a life-long commitment, many members have brought their families to live in the bastion, creating a small community bound together by love and loyalty.

### Sigil District

The Sigil District is one of the smaller districts in Ank'Harel but also one of the busiest. People from across the city commute here every day to study at the district's various centers of learning. From basic skills and trades to the most esoteric arcane ideals, various intellectual pursuits are represented in the Sigil District.

The Allegiance of Allsight is a pervasive presence in this district; many of the faction's members and affiliates are on the faculties and staffs of these schools. Institutions of learning constructed in Ank'Harel's infancy abut structures of more modern architecture, and buildings representing cultures from across Exandria are a counterpoint to the grand, Marquesian-style domes of the Crystal Chateau. At the heart of the district is the excavation that leads to Cael Morrow, the mysterious sunken city (see "Maw of Cael Morrow" below).

The Streets of the Sigil District map shows a small segment of the district associated with the faction missions later in the chapter. It includes the following locations:

- **S1 Crystal Chateau Entrance..** This elite university is described below.
- **S2 Teleportation Atrium..** A permanent teleportation circle stands in the center of this austere, domed building. Most [teleportation tablets](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) made by the Allegiance of Allsight are keyed to this circle.
- **S3 The Frog and Kebab..** No actual frogs are served at this popular tavern, which is frequented by students of the Crystal Chateau.
- **S4 Emerald Ibis Relic Hall..** Watched over by statues made of green glass and shaped like giant ibises, this hall is where the Allegiance of Allsight examines newly discovered items. See "Consortium Mission 3: Elephant in the Room" in the Consortium Story Track.
- **S5 Scroll's Alcove..** This apartment building is used mostly by professors at the Crystal Chateau and visiting guest lecturers. See "Cobalt Soul Mission 1: The Cultist of Zehir" in the Cobalt Soul Story Track.
- **S6 Lawbearer's Librams..** One of dozens of libraries in the Sigil District, this is the most extensive legal library in the city.
- **S7 Boughs of the Wild Mother..** Students can be found studying in the shade of this courtyard's giant sycamore tree during the day. Some say a ghost lurks here at night (see "Consortium Mission 1: A Ghost in Our Midst" in the Consortium Story Track).

#### Crystal Chateau

_Elite University and Headquarters of the Allegiance of Allsight_

An immense structure of smoky quartz and white marble, the Crystal Chateau is a major landmark in the Sigil District. A small stream winds through the gardens around the building before flowing under an opening into the main hall, where the bubbling sound of its water is said to help inspire the highest of thoughts. A white iron fence closes off the premises to all except members of the Allegiance of Allsight.

The Crystal Chateau serves double duty as a university for the teaching of spellcraft and arcane theory and as the center for the Allegiance's operations. Though not all members of the Allegiance are students or professors at the university, every would-be pupil must first become a member of the faction. Tuition is free, since the Chateau's expenses are subsidized by the city in the expectation that the university's graduates will use their gifts to protect Ank'Harel and enhance its prestige across the world.

Jor Raashid, a lawful neutral, halfling [scholarly agent](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-agent-crcotn.md) (see appendix A), is the gatekeeper for the Crystal Chateau. Suspicious and condescending, Jor sternly prohibits nonmembers from entering the Chateau.

#### Maw of Cael Morrow

_Excavation Site Entrance_

What was once a public square has been converted into an excavation site, from where the Allegiance of Allsight conducts its exploration into the ruins of Cael Morrow. The "maw" is a 150-foot-diameter, roped-off hole, admission into which is prohibited to all except for holders of Allegiance of Allsight badges. A 10-foot-wide path spirals down along the edge of the maw, descending hundreds of feet into Cael Morrow (see chapter 5).

##### Protection

A contingent of five lawful neutral Scarbearer [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) patrols the rim of the maw, on the lookout for unauthorized visitors. They are led by a loyal, lawful good, orc [scholarly excavator](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-excavator-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) named Hakzorne. He permits only people who display Allegiance badges to enter the maw; Hakzorne gives only one warning before ordering the mercenaries to attack.

#### Omnival Library

_Public Library_

Tan stone columns and pointed archways form the circumference of this enormous tower on the northeast side of the Sigil District. Inside, texts from across Exandria fill shelves that line the wall space between the floor and the library's vaulted gold ceiling. Staircases and magical lifts provide access to the highest shelves, and on the floor sits a mixture of weathered wooden desks and colorful cushions.

Any individual is welcome to borrow from the library, though access to the most esoteric and delicate materials requires the approval of an Allegiance of Allsight headmaster. Recent additions to the library include copies of notes from the latest Cael Morrow expeditions.

The Omnival Library is managed by Bookkeeper Khime, a neutral good, orc [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md). He's convinced that shadowy forces are constantly trying to undermine Ank'Harel, and this penchant for conspiracy theories makes him incredibly observant. He's an excellent source of information about happenings in the city, despite his wild conclusions.

#### Teres Schoolhouse

_University_

The larger and less stringent of the city's two universities, Teres Schoolhouse offers a curriculum that features practical applications of magic as well as a wide range of trade skills. Its physical presence, though not as imposing as that of the Crystal Chateau, occupies a large portion of the Sigil District, made up of both older buildings of weathered brick and newer structures built from stone quarried from northern Marquet.

Academic schedules at Teres Schoolhouse are typically divided into two semesters, each five months long. The institution also puts on single-session educational seminars that anyone in the city is welcome to attend. As with the Crystal Chateau, tuition at Teres Schoolhouse is free for all residents of Ank'Harel.

### Suncut Bazaar

Crimson banners, hanging flags of all colors, and cloth drapery that provides shade over the crowded streets herald the entrance to the Suncut Bazaar, the center of commerce in Ank'Harel. Awnings stretch above open-air food stalls that offer treats ranging from fresh fruit to sweet semolina cakes to warm meat carved directly off a roasting spit. Most of the densely packed stone buildings are stores that sell artisan goods and shops that buy and sell magic items and nonmagical trinkets. In the center of the district lies the palatial Luck's Run casino.

The Streets of the Suncut Bazaar map shows a small segment of the district that comes into play in the faction missions later in the chapter. It includes the following locations:

- **T1 Welcome Arch..** This vaulted stone archway draped with crimson banners welcomes everyone to the bazaar.
- **T2 Battlements..** The walls of the Suncut Bazaar are made of sandstone and patrolled day and night by Hands of Ord [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) and [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md).
- **T3 Central Street..** This dusty red road that runs throughout the district is so crowded with shoppers, pickpockets, tourists, and locals that it can be hard to see the paving stones.
- **T4 Market Stalls..** Market stalls shaded by awnings line the streets and alleys of the bazaar.
- **T5 Luck's Run..** This casino is described below.
- **T6 Bone Garden..** The bazaar's most infamous pawn shop is described below.
- **T7 Mystic Pursuits..** This arcanist's abode is described below.
- **T8 First Eclipse..** Both a tavern and the secret headquarters of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream, this venue is described below. Its roof is where the characters appear if they used one of Aloysia's [teleportation tablets](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) at the end of chapter 3.
- **T9 Courtyard..** During business hours, hungry folk line up in front of the food stalls on the west side of this courtyard while others sit around the edge of the courtyard's fountain and share gossip.

#### Bone Garden

_Purveyor of Oddities and Exceptionalities_

The clatter of fish-bone wind chimes announces one's entrance into the Bone Garden: a combination pawn shop, antique store, and repository of strange and misplaced items. The shop, which stands near the main entrance of the bazaar, has become a running joke among the residents of Ank'Harel. Fruitless searches for a missing key or a lost earring often end with the lighthearted comment "It'll probably end up among the Bones within the week."

The Bone Garden is run by Rerosha, a chaotic good, human [acolyte](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md) who's a nonverbal young woman with a brazen attitude toward life. She uses facial expressions, gestures, and a sassy gray parrot named Akil to communicate.

#### First Eclipse

_Tavern and Headquarters of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream_

In sharp contrast to the glimmering Luck's Run casino across the street, First Eclipse is notable for its maroon stone walls and ash-black door. Inside, old ale barrels have been turned into tables, and the back wall is covered with painted lids from ales, wine, and liquor casks from across Exandria.

One of these cask lids bears a symbol not associated with any known brewer: a red crescent moon. Servers, if asked about it, are told to explain that this lid represents the "house ale." In truth, knocking three times on the cask lid reveals a secret door that leads to a hidden storeroom. Members of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream use this room as a base of operations. (The Consortium changes its headquarters frequently to avoid detection.)

The secret room is little more than a cellar with a long table in it, with a few locked cabinets containing fist-sized chunks of ruidium. It is used only for private mission briefings and rare gatherings of all five of the faction's masters.

First Eclipse is owned and operated by Satzrak Runestrider, a neutral evil, blue dragonborn [occult extollant](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-extollant-crcotn.md) (see appendix A). He is a loyal member of the faction, and he longs to keep the Consortium headquartered at his place permanently; the group has already used the tavern for three months longer than originally planned, so his hopes are up.

#### Luck's Run

_World-Renowned Casino_

The Luck's Run casino stands three stories tall and is made of speckled red porphyry and topped with metallic domes in the palatial Marquesian style. After dark, faint purplish light escapes from the slit-like windows of the casino, and the sounds of laughter and music carry into the nearby streets.

Inside the casino, tables draped in crimson cloth fills the floor space, each location crowded with patrons trying their hand at one of the games of chance. Employees dressed in uniforms of dark gray and gold push through the throng while carrying trays of food, drinks, and coin between tables.

The casino is owned and run by Adima Shemsilver, a chaotic neutral, halfling [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) who walks with the confidence of someone twice his height. Adima secretly uses half of the casino's earnings to fund the Veil, as his family has done for generations.

Three of the most popular games at Luck's Run are described below.

##### Avandra's Favor

This dice game has a 25 gp minimum bet. Each participant rolls 2d6 and wins back twice their bet on a roll of 7 or 12. A participant who doesn't win can roll another d6 and add it to their total by wagering an additional 25 gp. A participant can do this as many times as they want, until they "bust" by accumulating a total higher than 12.

##### Gambit of Ord

This card game requires a 50 gp initial bet, which goes into a pot in the center of the table. Each participant draws a card, then a second, and then a third. After each draw, each participant has a chance to raise the bet, stand pat, or fold. The participants reveal their hands after the third card is drawn. Whoever has the highest-ranking hand takes the pot.

To simulate the play of this game, have each participant roll dice in secret. At the first draw, all participants roll a d8. The second draw is a d6 roll, and the third is a d4 roll. Then, all reveal their dice, and whoever has the highest total wins.

##### Quon a Drensal

Also known as "Run of Luck," this game is a contest of lizard racing. Each player can bet 10 gp or more on a single racer in a field of three, and anyone who backs the winner gets back double the amount wagered. Those who bet on the second-place lizard get back half their wager.

To simulate the play of this game, roll 3d4 for each lizard. The winning lizard is the one with the highest total (ties are possible).

#### Mystic Pursuits

_Arcane Shop_

Colorful tapestries frame the entrance to this establishment. Beyond the threshold, silk curtains cover the walls, and magical baubles cover low wooden tables illuminated by scented candles. A soothsayer sits in the back of the room, her deep blue hood pulled down over her eyes and a deck of cards spread out before her—offering an invitation to peer into one's future, if one so dares.

The "soothsayer" is a charlatan named Amkezne, a chaotic neutral, tiefling [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md). She is a Crystal Chateau dropout who makes a living defrauding wide-eyed tourists with her mystical displays and fake enchanted trinkets. Customers who see through her act but treat her with respect can purchase any spell component worth 1,000 gp or less from Amkezne. She also has a collection of fine jewelry for sale, including five gold bracelets (25 gp each), three gem-studded gold rings (250 gp each), and two jewel-encrusted necklaces and tiaras (750 gp each). An [invisible stalker](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) watches over this collection and attacks anyone who tries to steal from it.

## Faction Story Tracks

### What Lies Beneath

#### Allegiance Story Track

This section details the missions in the Allegiance Story Track, which are summarized in the accompanying flowchart.

### Allegiance Mission 1: Deliver the Figurine

As rumors about Cael Morrow continue to spread, the Allegiance of Allsight's expeditions have been targeted by other factions and would-be thieves. The Allegiance has recently located an item that was stolen during an encounter with one such thief: a [figurine of wondrous power (marble elephant)](/compendium/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-marble-elephant.md), now lying among the oddities and trinkets for sale at the Bone Garden in the Suncut Bazaar. The proprietor of the shop, Rerosha, has agreed to hand over the item to the Allegiance of Allsight. The faction tasks the characters with retrieving the figurine from Rerosha and delivering it safely to the Crystal Chateau. See the "Suncut Bazaar" section of the "Ank'Harel Gazetteer" for information about the Bone Garden.

#### Getting the Mission

This mission is communicated to the characters in a letter dropped on the doorstep of wherever they are staying. The message reads:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Allegiance hopefuls,
> 
> We need you to pick up and deliver a marble figurine of an elephant that was stolen from us. We have located it at a curio shop called the Bone Garden in the Suncut Bazaar and arranged for the proprietor, Rerosha, to hand over the merchandise without a fuss. Simply bring the figurine to Gatekeeper Raashid at the Crystal Chateau, and your task is complete.
> 
> Welcome in advance to the team!—Professor Lymmle Wist, Allegiance of Allsight
^1d5

#### Volatile Figurine

Unknown to anyone who has come into contact with it, the elephant figurine was infected with ruidium during its time in Cael Morrow, and that substance has warped its magical properties.

When a character tries to retrieve the figurine, it reacts as if it had been activated, transforming into a crystalline version of the creature it was meant to become (use the [ruidium elephant](/compendium/bestiary/construct/ruidium-elephant-crcotn.md) stat block earlier in the chapter). This creature can't be controlled.

The figurine transforms even if the space where the elephant appears is occupied by other creatures. A creature in the space where the elephant appears must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage and be pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.

The elephant exits the shop and begins rampaging through the streets of the bazaar. As the characters pursue, have everyone roll initiative; this encounter can be played out using the Streets of the Suncut Bazaar map.

Reducing the elephant to 0 hit points causes it to transform back into a figurine, after which it can be handled and transported safely. The figurine can't transform again for seven days.

##### Success

When the characters bring the figurine to Gatekeeper Raashid, outside the Crystal Chateau (area S1 on the Streets of the Sigil District map), their task is complete.

##### Failure

If the characters fail to defeat the elephant or don't deliver the figurine, the Allegiance refuses their applications for membership. They'll need to find another faction to help them investigate the mysteries of the Apotheon.

#### Keeping the Figurine

If the characters keep the elephant figurine for themselves, the elephant it creates uses the [ruidium elephant](/compendium/bestiary/construct/ruidium-elephant-crcotn.md) stat block (see earlier in the chapter) and can't be controlled.

If the characters slay or redeem the Apotheon (see chapter 7), the figurine is rid of its ruidium corruption and functions like a normal [figurine of wondrous power (marble elephant)](/compendium/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-marble-elephant.md).

### Allegiance Mission 2: Search the Life Dome

Chasing down a rumor for the Allegiance of Allsight, the characters are sent to investigate a possible second point of access into Cael Morrow, said to be in the River District. Their time spent learning about the sunken city is cut short when mysterious forces attack the group with intent to kill.

#### Getting the Mission

Early one morning, [Prolix Yusaf](/compendium/bestiary/npc/prolix-yusaf-crcotn.md) meets with the characters:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The bright-eyed tiefling says, "As you might be aware, the Allegiance of Allsight is conducting a massive excavation project in the Sigil District. It's an effort to explore the ruins of Cael Morrow, a much older city below Ank'Harel.
> 
> "Well, the Allegiance has heard rumors of another entrance into Cael Morrow that runs through the city's oasis. Would you please do us the favor of investigating these claims? I'm authorized to pay your group three hundred gold pieces for your time and trouble."
^1dc

If the characters agree to help, Prolix informs them that Carliale Kroogan, the gnome supervisor at the Life Dome, is expecting them in the early afternoon (see "Life Dome" earlier in the chapter).

##### True Motives

Unknown to Prolix, the rumors of a second entrance to Cael Morrow were planted by Lymmle Wist, a member of the Sentinels of Memory who has infiltrated the Allegiance of Allsight by posing as a highly accredited professor of antiquities. Though Lymmle doesn't appear during this mission, her machinations drive the plot. The characters are walking into an ambush—an effort by the Sentinels of Memory to wipe out those who would bring Cael Morrow back into living memory.

#### Into the Life Dome

When they arrive at the Life Dome, the characters are met by Carliale Kroogan, who's standing outside:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "I rarely get visitors," the gnome explains before turning to face the Life Dome. He holds aloft a thin shard of iridescent, glowing quartz, and, with a quiet hum, one of the dome's glass panels suddenly comes alight with blue and purple arcane runes—which then flicker and fade, leaving behind an opening. "Come on in! I'll give you the tour."
^1df

The inside of the dome is humid and sweltering, the smell of damp earth hitting one's senses along with a blast of hot air. A series of crystal bridges span the oasis's 60-foot-diameter lake, and the edges of the dome are lined with vegetation. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 17 or higher notice a brief, cool current of air as they begin to move about inside the dome (the side effect of an [invisible stalker](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) stealing Carliale's magic crystal).

##### Inspecting the Oasis

The lake's bottom is a thick layer of silt. A character who surveys the area and makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check finds no disturbance in the sediment that would suggest an underground passage to lower caverns.

##### Talking with Carliale

Carliale tries to answer any questions the characters have about the oasis. He knows the following information:

- The oasis is the primary source of fresh water in Ank'Harel.
- The water originates from the flooded caverns below Ank'Harel. These caverns are also where Cael Morrow is located, which lends credence to the rumors of an ancient passageway that connects Cael Morrow with the oasis.
- Relics retrieved from the Allegiance of Allsight's expeditions indicate that Cael Morrow was the site of a pre-Calamity society originally built above the water. Carliale theorizes that natural tectonic shifting caused the city to slip beneath the surface, but the fluctuation of the water level in the caverns seems to defy explanation.
- The Life Dome regulates the water flow to and through the canals. Using a combination of enchantment and engineering, the Life Dome dispenses water from the lake into the major canals while also drawing extra moisture from the air to supplement the water flow when necessary.
- The Life Dome normally functions automatically. As chief supervisor, Carliale can manually override the dome's controls and adjust the water level as needed.

At some point during the conversation, Carliale notices that his arcane override—the magic crystal he uses to open the entrance to the Life Dome and to adjust the dome's controls—has disappeared from his pocket. He assures the party that he must have dropped it back at the entrance.

#### Sudden Surge

As Carliale begins searching for his missing arcane override crystal, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The surface of the lake begins to churn white with foam, and seconds later an enormous geyser of water bursts upward and outward, sending you flying.
^1e3

Everyone in the Life Dome is swept outside the dome and propelled along a 5-foot-deep canal by the sudden surge of water.

When they see that the characters survived the surge, two [invisible stalkers](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) move in for the kill. The [invisible stalkers](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) were summoned by Professor Lymmle Wist and infiltrated the Life Dome a short time ago without Carliale's knowledge, slipping through the entrance as the gnome arrived for work. The [invisible stalkers](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) focus their attacks on the characters, ignoring Carliale.

After the battle, Carliale suspects that the [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) stalkers' summoner is associated with either the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream or the Sentinels of Memory. He describes these factions to the characters if they ask about them (see "City Factions" earlier in the chapter).

Characters who encountered the [invisible stalker](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) at Mystic Pursuits (described earlier in the chapter) might assume that Amkezne, the owner of that shop, is behind the Life Dome incident. Amkezne denies any involvement and is telling the truth. If the characters use magical coercion or threaten to report her to the Hands of Ord, Amkezne tells them that she learned how to summon [invisible stalkers](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) in her final year at the Crystal Chateau and that the professor who taught her the arcane ritual was Lymmle Wist (see mission 3 of this story track).

#### Returning to the Chateau

After foiling the ambush, the characters can take a moment to regroup before returning to the Crystal Chateau. After he hears their report, Prolix pays the characters the agreed amount of 300 gp and deeply apologizes for the events of the day. He expresses gratitude for the characters' skill, saying that he wishes the Allegiance of Allsight had more like them among their ranks.

#### Joining the Allegiance

If this mission is successful, Prolix recommends the characters to Headmaster [Gryz Alakritos](/compendium/bestiary/npc/gryz-alakritos-crcotn.md) as potential new members. Within a week, Alakritos presents each character with a formal invitation to join the faction's ranks. Membership comes with the following benefits:

- Each new member receives an Allegiance of Allsight badge, which can be presented as proof of membership. If a badge is lost, a new one can be issued for 50 gp.
- Each new member receives a stylish Allegiance of Allsight outfit. If the outfit is lost or damaged, a replacement can be purchased for 10 gp.
- Each new member receives free lodging in Ank'Harel for as long as their membership lasts. The lodging is of modest quality (see "Lodging" earlier in the chapter).

The characters can't receive any more missions from the Allegiance of Allsight unless they become members of the faction.

### Allegiance Mission 3: The Proxies of Prolix

Months ago, Watcher Lymmle Wist of the Sentinels of Memory infiltrated the Allegiance of Allsight. She has since advanced through the ranks and become one of the individuals responsible for assigning missions to Allegiance agents. During this time, she has also been feeding information about Allegiance operations to the Sentinels of Memory and the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.

Lymmle previously owned a [ring of red fury](/compendium/items/ring-of-red-fury-crcotn.md) (see appendix B), which was given to her by the Consortium as a reward for her services. She has decided to use the ring as part of a grander scheme. Recently, with the Allegiance of Allsight on high alert after the attack at the Life Dome, Lymmle planted the ring on [Prolix Yusaf](/compendium/bestiary/npc/prolix-yusaf-crcotn.md) and plans to falsely accuse the tiefling of being a traitor. Her contact with the ruidium in the ring has left its mark on her skin.

#### Getting the Mission

The characters notice a dark figure clumsily following them as they stroll through Ank'Harel one night. Confronting the figure reveals it to be a harried and distressed [Prolix Yusaf](/compendium/bestiary/npc/prolix-yusaf-crcotn.md), who immediately asks if they can talk in private.

Prolix wears nondescript dark clothes instead of his usual Allegiance of Allsight attire. When he and the characters are away from prying ears, he explains his plight:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "I think someone is trying to frame me for the attack at the Life Dome," he whispers.
> 
> "Earlier today, a thief snatched my satchel as I was walking down the street. I reported the theft, then went about my business. A few hours ago, someone used a _sending_ spell to notify me that my satchel had found its way to the Crystal Chateau and that I should claim it at once. I was on my way to retrieve it when I found this."
> 
> Rummaging in his pockets, he pulls out a silver ring with a stripe of red metal. "I think someone slipped it into my pocket, but I swear it's not mine. It looks like one of the magic items salvaged from Cael Morrow, but I can't be sure. You believe me, right?"
^1e8

Prolix is earnest and desperate in his claims of innocence. He fears that whoever planted the ring on him also planted something in his satchel to further incriminate him. He has no intention of returning to the Crystal Chateau or checking in with his superiors until he learns who is trying to set him up.

If the characters agree to help, Prolix points them toward his friend, Bookkeeper Khime, who manages the Omnival Library in the Sigil District and has records of every item of antiquity salvaged from Cael Morrow. Prolix believes that if the characters can determine where the ring came from, they can find the mastermind behind this plot.

#### Hunt for the Truth

When the characters go to the Omnival Library, Khime greets them from behind the front desk. He isn't a member of the Allegiance of Allsight, but he is willing to assist the characters by producing the following information from the library's archives:

- **Expeditions to Cael Morrow..** The records contain only one mention of a ring: in the inventory of an expedition from two months ago, which was staffed by agents Anbara Flintbreaker and Idris Lornen and led by Professor Lymmle Wist. The log indicates that the group was accosted by a thief on its way back to the surface, but mention of what was stolen is missing from the record.
- **Sentinels of Memory..** Allegiance documents confirm that the Sentinels of Memory are a new faction, established at around the time the project to explore the sunken ruins began. The documents assert that the Sentinels of Memory believe the so-called "Under-Temple" is a prison, meant to be kept sealed and forgotten.
- **Ruidium..** The name coined by the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream to identify the reddish mineral found in the ruins of Cael Morrow has entered the academic lexicon. The extent of its properties has yet to be known, but early reports say that the mineral produces red crystalline veins in other substances—inorganic and organic alike—that remain in prolonged contact with it.

A character who examines the expedition records and makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices a pattern: some of the expedition logs and inventories of recovered items have been redacted or left unfinished. A character who succeeds on this check by 5 or more notices that all these records were from expeditions led by Lymmle Wist.

If asked for his opinion, Khime confides in the characters that he's inclined to believe the rumors that the Sentinels of Memory will do anything to achieve their goal: keeping Ank'Harel safe from whatever might be lurking below it. Furthermore, he believes the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream and the Sentinels of Memory are working together against their common enemy, the Allegiance of Allsight.

##### Interrogating the Excavators

To learn more about what they discovered in the library records, the characters can question the expedition members at the Crystal Chateau.

Anbara and Idris (lawful neutral, human [acolytes](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md)), the two agents from the expedition that recovered the ring, vaguely recall being attacked during their work, but they can't provide any details. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) or Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check discerns that this claim of ignorance is not a lie—Anbara and Idris have had their memories of the incident tampered with. Restoring their memories with a [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic causes them to recall that Professor Wist led the group through a wrong turn, to an area where they were accosted by an armed ruffian. They were knocked out in the ensuing scuffle, but they can't identify who cast the spell or wielded the weapon that [incapacitated](/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) them.

If Lymmle Wist (a neutral evil, human [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) is questioned, she deftly addresses the characters' inquiries, and her responses conform to the expedition records. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check notices a guarded expression in her eyes and a terse undertone in her voice, indicating her discomfort. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher notice thin, elevated red veins encircling the base of her right ring finger—the result of her exposure to the [ring of red fury](/compendium/items/ring-of-red-fury-crcotn.md) before she planted it on Prolix.

#### Infiltrator Exposed

The characters can present their findings to Headmaster [Gryz Alakritos](/compendium/bestiary/npc/gryz-alakritos-crcotn.md) (see "City Factions" earlier in the chapter) and make a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. The DC drops to 13 if Anbara and Idris are with the characters and at least one of them has had their memory restored. On a successful check, the headmaster immediately dispatches agents to apprehend Lymmle.

The characters can confront Lymmle directly by going to her office in the Crystal Chateau. Lymmle initially denies the accusation, then tries to turn the tables on the characters by accusing them of having ulterior motives. When it becomes clear to her that the characters are insistent, she casts [fly](/compendium/spells/fly.md) on herself and tries to escape by smashing through the window behind her desk. If she's unable to escape, Lymmle fights to the death.

#### Epilogue

After Lymmle is exposed as a traitor, Headmaster Alakritos gives the characters a pouch containing a reward of 50 pp. He also hands them a satchel and asks them to return it to Prolix—minus the Life Dome schematics and other incriminating paperwork planted in it by Lymmle.

In gratitude, Prolix lets the characters keep the [ring of red fury](/compendium/items/ring-of-red-fury-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) as long as they promise to share anything they learn about the ring's properties.

### Allegiance Mission 4: The Double Agent

Seven days after their previous mission for the Allegiance of Allsight, the characters are summoned to meet with Headmasters [James Cryon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/james-cryon-crcotn.md) and [Gryz Alakritos](/compendium/bestiary/npc/gryz-alakritos-crcotn.md) in Cryon's office at the Crystal Chateau. The headmasters want the characters to find a double agent who is undermining the Allegiance's activities in the ruins of Cael Morrow.

#### Getting the Mission

When the characters arrive for their meeting with the headmasters, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> As you step into the office of Headmaster Cryon, you see that both he and Headmaster Alakritos are present. The former welcomes you curtly, while the latter gestures for you to take seats in armchairs.
> 
> "It seems you can add counterespionage to your list of accomplishments," Headmaster Cryon says coolly.
> 
> "And a good thing, too!" Headmaster Alakritos follows up hastily. "There is trouble in Cael Morrow."
^1ef

[James Cryon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/james-cryon-crcotn.md) is a condescending elitist, while [Gryz Alakritos](/compendium/bestiary/npc/gryz-alakritos-crcotn.md) is less abrasive and more down-to-earth. Each, in his own way, has the best interests of the Allegiance of Allsight at heart. They brief the characters on the following details that Allegiance spies have uncovered:

- The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream has infiltrated the Allegiance's excavation site in Cael Morrow.
- There is a double agent in the archaeological team.
- This spy is presumably helping the Consortium find and smuggle ruidium.

The headmasters request that the characters accomplish the following tasks and report back within seven days:

- Enter Cael Morrow, travel to the Allegiance of Allsight's base camp, and meet with [Insight Acuere](/compendium/bestiary/npc/insight-acuere-crcotn.md), a professor of archaeology and the leader of the current expedition.
- Explore Cael Morrow and capture or kill the Consortium spy.

Alakritos gives each character an Allegiance of Allsight badge if they don't already have one, as well as a [potion of water breathing](/compendium/items/potion-of-water-breathing.md) (in case the character wants to travel outside the air-filled areas of Cael Morrow). The badges are proof of the characters' Allegiance affiliation and allow them to enter Cael Morrow and move around freely within the excavation site. Cryon warns them that the spy must have already acquired a badge.

The reward for eliminating the double agent is 1,000 gp and continued access to Cael Morrow for as long as the characters remain members of the Allegiance of Allsight.

#### Finding the Double Agent

The number of workers in the Cael Morrow archaeological expedition has dwindled recently. Currently, only Professor [Insight Acuere](/compendium/bestiary/npc/insight-acuere-crcotn.md), a kenku named [Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md), and a goliath named [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) are there. None of them is the double agent.

If the characters ask Professor Acuere about other members of the expedition, she mentions that many excavators have been lost. She seems most interested in learning the fate of her friend [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md), an adjunct professor of ancient literature at the Crystal Chateau. Unknown to Professor Acuere, [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) is the Consortium spy.

#### Key Locations

This mission takes place primarily in Cael Morrow. Key locations the characters must visit are as follows:

- **Maw of Cael Morrow..** This location is the entrance to the Drowned City (see the "Maw of Cael Morrow" section earlier in the chapter).

##### Allegiance Base Camp ({@area Chapter 5, Area M3|28b|x})

This site is the center of Allegiance operations in Cael Morrow. Professor [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) Acuere runs the show from here.

##### Hall of the Royal Library ({@area Chapter 5, Area M7a|2a1|x})

Here is where the spy, [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md), can be found. She is trying to find the so-called Key to the Netherdeep. If seven days pass before the characters reach this location, she is gone.

##### Cliffside Villa ({@area Chapter 5, Area M13|2be|x})

This site is where the characters can find the Key to the Netherdeep that [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) is searching for. If seven days pass and the characters haven't defeated [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md), the key is gone.

#### Returning to the Chateau

If the characters defeat [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md), the headmasters give them the 1,000 gp reward as promised, and Alakritos tells them to expect their next mission in a week's time. If the characters bring back the ruidium greataxe (the Key to the Netherdeep), they are awarded an additional 1,000 gp.

### Allegiance Mission 5: Scout the Rift

Seven days after the characters return from their first expedition into Cael Morrow, Headmaster Cryon invites them back to his office to brief them on a new mission that will lead them through a planar rift and into the Netherdeep.

#### Getting the Mission

Headmaster Cryon begins the meeting by sternly proclaiming, "The survival of the Allegiance of Allsight likely depends on the success of this mission." He then provides characters with the following details:

- The Allegiance of Allsight has found a planar rift in Cael Morrow that leads to an unknown destination.
- The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream has sent agents to the rift to figure out how to pass through it, with unknown results.
- If the Allegiance of Allsight is to prevent the Consortium from taking over Cael Morrow, the characters must enter the rift and learn what is on the other side.

A character who succeeds on a DC 19 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check realizes that Headmaster Cryon is on edge because he arranged this meeting without Headmaster Alakritos's knowledge. Prior to the characters' arrival, Alakritos and Cryon had a disagreement over the final point in the briefing. Alakritos believes that the rift must not be disturbed, but Cryon thinks that it contains a source of power that would help destroy the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream and the Sentinels of Memory.

Headmaster Cryon requests that the characters accomplish the following tasks and report back to him before seven days have elapsed:

- Find a way to open the rift.
- Enter the rift and confirm that ruidium can be found inside it.

If the characters acquired the Key to the Netherdeep in the previous mission, they have already accomplished their first goal. In that case, Cryon gives the greataxe to them so they can use it to open the rift. He also offers each character a [potion of water breathing](/compendium/items/potion-of-water-breathing.md), in case they have no other way to navigate the water-filled areas of Cael Morrow.

The reward for entering the rift (and thus, the Netherdeep) and reporting on what lies beyond is 1,000 gp.

#### Key Locations

This mission takes place primarily in Cael Morrow. Key locations the characters must visit are as follows:

- **Maw of Cael Morrow..** This location is the main entrance to the Drowned City (see the "Maw of Cael Morrow" section earlier in the chapter).

##### Cliffside Villa ({@area Chapter 5, Area M13|2be|x})

This site is where the characters can find the Key to the Netherdeep.

##### Temple of the Arch Heart ({@area Chapter 5, Area M9|2ad|x})

This structure is Alyxian's final prayer site. If the characters haven't acquired the Key to the Netherdeep, advancing the Jewel of Three Prayers to its [Exalted State](/compendium/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-exalted-crcotn.md) at this prayer site will enable them to enter the rift.

##### Rift to the Netherdeep ({@area Chapter 5, Area M17|2ce|x})

This planar rift connects the Netherdeep with the Material Plane.

#### Returning to the Chateau

When they enter the Netherdeep, the characters must contend with the water pressure (see "Netherdeep Features" in chapter 6). If they don't have sufficient protection, they'll need to return to the Crystal Chateau and acquire it.

After the mission concludes, the characters come back to the Chateau to find Cryon and Alakritos arguing furiously. Cryon turns to them with an expression of barely concealed glee and thanks them for their service. Alakritos glumly thanks them as well, then encourages them to rest up while they await their next mission. There is no turning back now that the rift has been breached.

### Allegiance Mission 6: Secure the Netherdeep

The final mission in the Allegiance Story Track requires the characters to delve into the Netherdeep and secure a large enough amount of ruidium to permanently thwart the Allegiance's enemies.

#### Getting the Mission

Seven days after the characters return from their previous mission, Headmasters Cryon and Alakritos brief the characters on their new job:

- In recent days, the Allegiance of Allsight has perfected the crafting of ruidium weapons and armor. Initial experimentation has established that such equipment provides its user with protection from the hazards of an underwater environment.
- Several of these weapons were issued to Allegiance scouts, who were given instructions to submerge themselves and explore the rift. All but one of them have failed to return and are presumed dead.
- The lone survivor briefly spoke to an expedition member before succumbing to her wounds. She said her ruidium weapon enabled her to survive the water pressure beyond the rift, and she described hearing the voice of a "sorrowful intelligence" as she navigated the Netherdeep, before running into a creature that laid her low.

The headmasters request that the characters accomplish the following tasks and inform them of the results before fourteen days have elapsed:

- Enter the Netherdeep.
- Contact the "sorrowful intelligence" that resides within, and convince it to allow the Allegiance of Allsight to extract ruidium without being threatened by the creatures of the Netherdeep.

If the party agrees to undertake the mission, the headmasters equip each character with a ruidium dagger. The headmasters' reward for completion of this mission is a promotion to the upper ranks of the Allegiance of Allsight and 5,000 gp each.

#### Failure

This mission, unbeknownst to the characters or anyone else, is doomed to fail. If the characters talk to Alyxian about harvesting ruidium while they're in the Netherdeep, Alyxian promises them whatever they want, as long as they free him from the Heart of Despair. The characters have no chance of claiming the reward, regardless of the adventure's outcome (see chapter 7).

### Vermilion Gambits

This section details the missions in the Consortium Story Track, which are summarized in the accompanying flowchart.

#### Consortium Story Track

### Consortium Mission 1: A Ghost in Our Midst

Characters who weren't introduced to the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream by Aloysia might have a hard time joining the faction, given its secretive nature. Those who want to pursue membership in the faction without Aloysia's help can spend a day gathering information from Ank'Harel's citizens. At the end of that time, any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check has learned that an organization of red-robed occultists meets in a tavern called First Eclipse.

If the characters enter First Eclipse (see the "Suncut Bazaar" section earlier in the chapter), they are greeted by the bartender, Satzrak Runestrider, a neutral evil, blue dragonborn [occult extollant](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-extollant-crcotn.md) (see appendix A). If they ask him about the Consortium, he gives each of them a drink on the house and tells them to keep quiet. When they finish their drinks, Satzrak hisses, "Go home and wait for a letter."

#### Getting the Mission

Characters who have expressed interest in joining the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream receive an unsigned letter at their lodgings. It reads:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Aspirants,
> 
> We have a mission that will test your abilities. Do not try to contact us again until you have fulfilled it.
> 
> Rumors say a ghost haunts the shrine to the Wild Mother in the Sigil District in the dark hours. Folk who enter or even pass too close the shrine at night hear dreadful wailing and feel the touch of blood-chilling, ghostly hands.
> 
> Learn the truth about this spirit and, if possible, turn its wrath to our benefit. Any advantage we can have in the Sigil District is a useful one.
^20b

#### Search for the Ghost

Finding the shrine is simple, since there is only one shrine to the Wild Mother in the Sigil District (area S7 on the Streets of the Sigil District map). If the characters investigate this area at night, one of them is targeted by a [chill touch](/compendium/spells/chill-touch.md) spell as a lonely wail fills the air. If they enter the shrine, they see movement inside.

The "ghost" is [Shira](/compendium/bestiary/npc/shira-crcotn.md), a shy, anxious 15-year-old human with innate spellcasting ability. Fearing for the safety of those around her as she learns to control her powers, [Shira](/compendium/bestiary/npc/shira-crcotn.md) has taken to using the shrine as a nighttime hiding place. She mimics the behavior of a spirit to frighten away others.

[Shira](/compendium/bestiary/npc/shira-crcotn.md) is a chaotic good, human [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md), with the following additional action option:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Spellcasting.** [Shira](/compendium/bestiary/npc/shira-crcotn.md) casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 10, +2 to hit with spell attacks):
> 
> At will: [chill touch](/compendium/spells/chill-touch.md)
> 
> 1/day each: [blindness/deafness](/compendium/spells/blindness-deafness.md), [ray of sickness](/compendium/spells/ray-of-sickness.md)
^20d

[Shira](/compendium/bestiary/npc/shira-crcotn.md) uses her spells to drive away intruders. A character can use an action to try to force her to surrender, doing so with a successful DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, whereupon [Shira](/compendium/bestiary/npc/shira-crcotn.md) breaks down into tears and ceases her attacks. Only then can she be convinced to try to find another place in the city to sleep. She will grudgingly accept being taken in by a foster parent, if the characters offer to help her with this solution.

#### A Home for Shira

If the characters want to find a safe home for [Shira](/compendium/bestiary/npc/shira-crcotn.md) and bring her to First Eclipse for that purpose, Satzrak the bartender shows a soft side of his persona and offers her a small, private room in the tavern, along with free room and board if she's willing to perform simple chores and "not make trouble." Satzrak is inwardly happy to be a kind, loving father figure to [Shira](/compendium/bestiary/npc/shira-crcotn.md).

### Consortium Mission 2: When Luck Runs Out

As a small organization with expensive needs, the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is in constant need of funds, prompting the faction's leaders to loan out the services of their agents and associates to customers who want protection.

Adima Shemsilver, the proprietor of the Luck's Run casino, has heard rumors that a group of thieves plans to rob the casino's coin vault. To avoid involving the Hands of Ord, Adima has turned to the Consortium for protection, and the Consortium turns to the characters.

#### Getting the Mission

The characters receive an urgently worded missive summoning them to First Eclipse, where Satzrak orders them a round of ale on the house and slides a note beneath one of the drinks that reads, "She's waiting in the back for you." If pressed for more information, Satzrak doesn't elaborate.

Inside the Consortium's hidden storeroom in the back of the tavern, the characters find [Aloysia Telfan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aloysia-telfan-crcotn.md). If Aloysia died earlier in the adventure, replace her with another [occult initiate](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-initiate-crcotn.md) (see appendix A), and modify the following text accordingly:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Well, you made it," Aloysia says. She hops off her stool and holds out a leather bag, jingling with the sound of coins. "I hope you're not disappointed by mercenary work. It's not as exciting as other jobs, but it pays well."
^212

Aloysia explains that the Consortium has been hired by Adima Shemsilver, the owner of Luck's Run, to guard the casino against a robbery rumored to be happening that night.

If the characters accept the task, Aloysia pays them 250 gp now and says that Luck's Run will pay them another 750 gp for the successful capture of the thieves, 500 gp of which is to be handed over to the Consortium. She tells them to arrive at Luck's Run an hour before sundown, when the captain of the casino's security staff will brief them further.

#### At the Casino

When the characters get to Luck's Run, Security Captain Nedosi Anay, a neutral, half-orc [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md), brusquely briefs them. She relays the following information:

- Nedosi's intelligence reports say that at least three thieves will be working together to pull off this operation, which begins at sundown.
- Nedosi assumes the thieves will target the casino's coin vault on the third floor, where most of the establishment's earnings are stored each day.
- The coin vault is sealed with a magic lock. Narrow chutes, each 6 inches in diameter, extend from the inside of the vault to dispensers on the lower floors. Only casino employees can access these dispensers, which they must do before doling out winnings to the casino's patrons.

Nedosi wants two characters to station themselves right outside the coin vault while the rest patrol the casino's ground floor with her. If the characters don't have the ability to communicate with each other from a distance, she gives each of them a fully charged [earring of message](/compendium/items/earring-of-message-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) to use for the night before ordering them to their posts. She demands that the characters use force only if necessary, and only of the nonlethal variety.

##### Casino Floor

At night the casino is crowded, as people filter in after work has finished for the day to try their hand at one of the casino's games. Each floor of the casino is patrolled by four [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md); in addition, the ground floor is staffed by ten [commoners](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md). A pair of finely upholstered spiral staircases in the back of the building connects the three floors. Each staircase is magical and functions like an escalator—one has stairs that carry patrons upward, while the other has stairs that move downward.

##### Vault Doors

Forged of gleaming steel, the casino's cylindrical coin vault sits in the center of the third floor—in full view from any direction, so no one can approach the vault without being seen.

The vault is 10 feet in diameter and rises 20 feet to the apex of the casino's domed ceiling. It appears to have no door, but a character who examines the vault and succeeds on a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a thin keyhole near its base. The vault's lock can be opened by using a master key, which only Nedosi and Adima possess, by a character who makes a successful DC 21 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md), or by magic. Nedosi has her copy of the master key on her person.

##### Vault Trap

If the vault is opened by any means other than using the master key, the vault's magical trap is triggered. Each creature within 5 feet of the vault must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 36 (8d8) psychic damage and is [stunned](/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [stunned](/rules/conditions.md#stunned).

The trap can't be disarmed, but successfully casting [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (DC 15) on the lock before an attempt is made to open it suppresses the trap for 1 minute, allowing the lock to be manipulated without negative consequences.

#### Casino Heist

As the sun sinks below the horizon, the thieves put their plan in motion. Three individuals are involved in the operation:

- Ena (neutral, human [berserker](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md)) masquerades as a casino patron.
- Duskwood (chaotic neutral, half-elf [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)), like Ena, masquerades as a casino patron and wears a [hat of disguise](/compendium/items/hat-of-disguise.md).
- [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) (lawful neutral, tiefling [assassin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)), the crew's leader, works at one of the casino's card tables—a job she has held for about a month. She carries a [potion of gaseous form](/compendium/items/potion-of-gaseous-form.md), a tiny packet containing [dust of disappearance](/compendium/items/dust-of-disappearance.md), and a [bag of holding](/compendium/items/bag-of-holding.md).

If any of the thieves are confronted before they can pull off the heist, they try to flee the casino and foil any pursuers by running through the streets. Resolve such a chase using the "chase rules" and the Urban Chase Complications table in the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

The planned heist has four stages:

- **Stage 1.** Lead-Up. Ena, Duskwood, and [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) begin on the ground floor of the casino. A character who scans the crowd and succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check notices Ena's disinterest in the dice game she's standing at. Shortly thereafter, Duskwood begins chatting with one of the guards near Nedosi, and a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check notices the half-elf watching someone over the shoulder of the guard.
- **Stage 2.** Infiltration. Characters on floor duty who know thieves' cant or have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher notice the three thieves flashing quick hand signals to each other. [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) abruptly excuses herself from the game she's running and heads toward the employee area; a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check can follow her without being noticed. If she is detained, [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) explains that she's on the way to collect winnings for one of her patrons, but a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check sees through the lie. If she is not prevented from doing so, [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) imbibes a [potion of gaseous form](/compendium/items/potion-of-gaseous-form.md) and enters one of the coin chutes that connect with the vault.
- **Stage 3.** Coin with Two Heads. When [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) has entered the coin chute, Ena stands up from her seat and starts berating the guard whom Duskwood is chatting with. As Nedosi tries to break up the fight, Duskwood lifts the casino master key from her pocket, an act that a character on floor duty can spot with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Duskwood then ascends the spiral staircase and uses their [hat of disguise](/compendium/items/hat-of-disguise.md) to assume Nedosi's visage before arriving on the third floor. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check sees through Duskwood's trick as the thief approaches the vault.

##### Stage 4

**Getaway**. Inside the vault, [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) dismisses her gaseous form, dumps a total of 10,000 gp into her [bag of holding](/compendium/items/bag-of-holding.md), and then uses [dust of disappearance](/compendium/items/dust-of-disappearance.md) to become [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible). Duskwood, disguised as Nedosi, unlocks the vault from the outside, pretends to inspect the interior as the [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) escapes, and shuts it again. Characters standing guard outside the vault hear [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) slip past them with a successful DC 24 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Duskwood and [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) both leave the third floor while Ena faints in the arms of a guard downstairs to create a minor distraction. Ena then heads outside to "get some air." If the other two thieves are not stopped, the pair reunites with Ena outside the casino, and all three escape into the night with their spoils.

##### Aiding and Abetting

If any of the thieves are approached privately about their intent, they offer the characters a cut of the stolen money, amounting to 800 gp, if they let the thieves perpetrate the heist. A character who makes a successful DC 11 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check involving any of the three thieves discerns they are earnest about this offer.

If the characters aid the thieves without getting caught, [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) gives them their cut and thanks them, promising to return the favor in the future. After the heist, finding [Koris](/compendium/bestiary/npc/koris-crcotn.md) in Ank'Harel requires 8 hours of searching and a successful DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, since she's keeping a low profile. A failed check can be repeated, but only after another search.

#### Returning to First Eclipse

The characters' stint as mercenaries ends at sunrise, after which they are expected to return to First Eclipse. Their mission has one of two outcomes, each described below.

##### Thieves Are Caught

If the characters apprehended the thieves, Nedosi thanks them and pays them the agreed-upon 750 gp before they depart the casino. She explains that, even though the casino is loath to interact with the Hands of Ord, the thieves will be turned over to the Hands for justice to take its course. The characters are welcome to keep any magic items they confiscated from the thieves.

Aloysia is waiting at First Eclipse to collect the 500 gp that is due to the Consortium. She says she hopes to see the characters advance in the ranks of the Consortium.

##### Thieves Escaped

If the characters were unable to stop the thieves or let them go, Nedosi is frustrated by their failure, but she still pays them 375 gp (half the agreed-upon amount) for their efforts.

When the characters return to First Eclipse and tell Aloysia what happened, she expresses disappointment but says the Consortium will overlook their failure if they're willing to provide the expected 500 gp.

#### Joining the Consortium

If the characters complete the mission and hand over the expected 500 gp, they are offered membership in the Consortium. Membership comes with the following benefits:

- Each new member receives a red robe like those worn by other members of the Consortium. If the robe is lost or damaged, a replacement can be purchased at First Eclipse for 1 gp.
- Each new member receives free lodging in Ank'Harel for as long as their membership lasts. The lodging is of squalid quality (see "Lodging" earlier in the chapter).
- Each new member receives a 10 percent discount on purchases at the arcane shop Mystic Pursuits (see "Mystic Pursuits" earlier in the chapter). The discount expires in thirty days.

The characters can't receive any more missions from the Consortium unless they become members of the faction.

### Consortium Mission 3: Elephant in the Room

The Allegiance of Allsight has recently come into possession of a ruidium magic item found in Cael Morrow. The leaders of the Consortium want the characters to infiltrate the Crystal Chateau and obtain the item for them.

#### Getting the Mission

The characters are summoned to First Eclipse, where Satzrak quietly informs them that one of the masters of the Consortium wants to speak with them, though he doesn't know why. Following Satzrak's directions, the characters enter the tavern's secret storeroom to find Master [Aradrine the Owl](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aradrine-the-owl-crcotn.md), a lawful neutral, goliath [occult silvertongue](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-silvertongue-crcotn.md) (see appendix A), waiting for them. For more information on goliaths, see the "Goliaths of Exandria" sidebar earlier in the chapter.

Aradrine expresses appreciation for the characters' decision to join their ranks before asking if they are now ready to learn the truth about the Consortium's studies in Ank'Harel:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Behold," Aradrine says, rolling up the sleeve of her robe to expose the web of pulsing red veins that spreads across her forearm. She brings out a dagger from the folds of her robe. Its silver blade is veined with organic growths the same color as the ones on her arm. "This," she says, pointing to the strip of metal, "is ruidium. A gift from Ruidus, the Moon of Ill Omen, salvaged from the ruins beneath the city. Some recoil at its power, but we embrace it."
^220

Aradrine explains that the Consortium first became aware of this strange mineral through the efforts of a spy who had access to Cael Morrow. The Consortium has sent other agents to infiltrate the excavation site and steal samples of the mineral, but the Allegiance of Allsight's control over Cael Morrow makes this task exceedingly difficult, prompting further acts of espionage in Ank'Harel.

Aradrine wants the characters to retrieve a [figurine of wondrous power](/compendium/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-marble-elephant.md) in the shape of an elephant that has been affected by ruidium. She believes the figurine is being kept inside the Crystal Chateau. She asks the characters to press the Crystal Chateau's gatekeeper, Jor Raashid, for information.

Locations in this mission are keyed to the Streets of the Sigil District map earlier in the chapter.

#### Grilling the Gatekeeper

The characters find Gatekeeper Jor Raashid (see "Crystal Chateau" earlier in the chapter) standing next to the double door that leads into the Crystal Chateau's entry hall (area S1). To coax information out of the halfling, a character must either deceive, intimidate, or otherwise persuade him by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If the party has successfully completed a mission for the Allegiance of Allsight and thus has been seen by Jor before, this check is made with advantage.

Jor knows that the elephant figurine has been moved from the Crystal Chateau to a vault inside the Emerald Ibis Relic Hall (area S4 on the Streets of the Sigil District map presented earlier in the chapter). If the characters fail to obtain this information by other means, a character can pry it from his mind with a [detect thoughts](/compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell or similar magic.

#### Assassins Above

As the characters travel to the storehouse where the elephant figurine is being kept, they are watched from the rooftops by two lawful evil, human [assassins](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) who have been hired by the Sentinels of Memory to grab the figurine from the storehouse and return it to the faction's headquarters. After watching the characters interact with Jor Raashid, the assassins follow them to the storehouse. When the characters arrive, the assassins attack. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 19 or higher spot the assassins before they attack and are not surprised during the first round of combat.

##### Long Hands of the Law

On initiative count 20 of the third round of combat, five Hands of Ord [knights](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) arrive to apprehend everyone involved in the brawl. The assassins try to flee rather than face arrest and incarceration. Two of the knights pursue the assassins while the remaining knights try to take the characters into custody. If the characters don't resist, they are held overnight in a Sigil District jail, then released the next morning and fined 50 gp each for disturbing the peace. This delay enables the Allegiance of Allsight to keep the [figurine of wondrous power](/compendium/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-marble-elephant.md) safe, and the mission ends in failure (see "Mission Failed" below).

#### Emerald Ibis Relic Hall

During the day, this storehouse is open to the public. Students of the Crystal Chateau mingle and study the items that are displayed in glass bells throughout this warmly furnished research hall.

##### Daytime Entry

The hall is managed by Relickeeper Kareema, a neutral good, orc [scholarly agent](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-agent-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) with messy dark curls and round glasses. If the characters convince her that they are members of the Allegiance of Allsight with a successful DC 18 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check, she reveals that the figurine was placed in the downstairs vault (see "Basement Vault" below). On a failed check, Kareema becomes suspicious of the characters' intentions; she gives them the information, but then scuttles away to alert her superiors.

##### Nighttime Entry

The hall's front door is locked at night. A character who makes a successful DC 21 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) can open the door. It can also be forced open by a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Anyone who breaks into the hall in this way is attacked by six animated statues that resemble ibises. The statues, which are made of green glass, patrol the public spaces during off hours. A single character can avoid the statues' notice with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check; if two or more characters are present, have them make a group check instead.

Each [animated glass statue](/compendium/bestiary/construct/animated-glass-statue-crcotn.md) uses the [giant vulture](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-vulture.md) stat block, with these changes:

- Each statue is a Construct that has [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.
- Each statue has immunity to the [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [paralyzed](/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified), and [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) conditions.

A search of the room reveals that the figurine isn't in the public display area. But the characters discover a staircase in the southeast corner of the building that leads down to the basement (see "Basement Vault" below), which is not patrolled by animated statues.

#### Basement Vault

The basement of the hall contains a hidden vault. A character who searches the basement and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the faint outline of a circular stone door in the wall next to a bookcase that is bolted to the floor.

A character who examines the bookcase and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check spots four tiny symbols engraved in its wood. A character who then succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes them as symbols of abjuration, evocation, divination, and transmutation. When a character casts a spell from one of those schools of magic while within 10 feet of the bookcase, the bookcase absorbs the spell (which is expended with no effect), and the corresponding rune begins to glow. If a spell from each of the four schools is absorbed by the bookcase, the vault door swings open. Magic cannot otherwise open the door.

A character can use an action to try to forcibly pry open the vault door, doing so with a successful DC 21 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Forcing the vault open, however, produces a loud, concussive blast of energy that fills a 15-foot cube immediately outside the vault. This trap can't be disarmed. Any creature in the cube must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Treasure

A short flight of stairs descends into the main chamber of the vault. Square alcoves line the walls, and inside one of them is the [figurine of wondrous power](/compendium/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-marble-elephant.md).

Most of the other alcoves are empty, but a thorough search of the vault also yields a set of [Nolzur's marvelous pigments](/compendium/items/nolzurs-marvelous-pigments.md) and a [wand of wonder](/compendium/items/wand-of-wonder.md).

#### Hasty Getaway

If the characters aroused Kareema's suspicions or activated the trap in the basement vault, they are intercepted as they exit the hall by Headmaster [James Cryon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/james-cryon-crcotn.md), a lawful neutral, elf [scholarly mastermind](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-mastermind-crcotn.md), and two lawful neutral [scholarly excavators](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-excavator-crcotn.md) serving as bodyguards (see appendix A for their stat blocks). Headmaster Cryon is willing to talk as long as the characters seem willing to relinquish the figurine, but if any character tries to escape with it, Headmaster Cryon and his bodyguards attack.

The three Allegiance members try to incapacitate the characters and reclaim any items that were removed from the vault. If Headmaster Cryon is reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, he curses and calls for a retreat, allowing the characters to get away.

#### Returning with the Elephant

Master Aradrine is delighted if the characters deliver the elephant figurine to her, and she allows them to keep any plunder they gained from their mission. In addition, she makes arrangements to have one ruidium weapon or a suit of ruidium armor of their choice (see appendix B) delivered to them within 1d6 days.

#### Keeping the Figurine

The characters can keep the elephant figurine, but they would be wise not to use it, for the elephant it creates uses the [ruidium elephant](/compendium/bestiary/construct/ruidium-elephant-crcotn.md) stat block (see earlier in the chapter) and can't be controlled.

If the characters slay or redeem the Apotheon (see chapter 7), the figurine is rid of its ruidium corruption and functions like a normal [figurine of wondrous power (marble elephant)](/compendium/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-marble-elephant.md).

#### Mission Failed

If the characters return to Aradrine without the figurine, the goliath beholds them coolly and snarls, "I have precious little sympathy for failures. Get out of my sight." Characters who beg for Aradrine's forgiveness only anger her further. If they refuse to leave, she calls in six [occult initiates](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-initiate-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) to remove them.

After a week of silence, the characters receive a letter from [Aloysia Telfan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aloysia-telfan-crcotn.md). If Aloysia died earlier in the adventure, the letter is sent by another Consortium agent (modify the following text accordingly):

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Fellow initiates,
> 
> Master Aradrine has decided to overlook your failure. Your connection to the Apotheon is too strong to allow a single misstep to disqualify you from further service. She requests your presence for a significant assignment—one that will require utmost stealth. Another failure will not be tolerated.
> 
> —[Aloysia Telfan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aloysia-telfan-crcotn.md)
^22d

### Consortium Mission 4: Key to the Netherdeep

Seven days after the end of their last mission, the characters are invited to meet with Aradrine at her home—a modest apartment with shuttered windows in Ank'Harel's Guided District. Read or paraphrase the following when they arrive:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A panel on the door to Aradrine's apartment slides open. Her eyes peer at you for a moment; then the panel closes and the door opens. The interior is dimly lit, and the walls are covered with astronomical charts and crimson drapery.
> 
> Aradrine is dressed not in her usual red robes, but in a simple, sleeveless tunic. The crimson growths and crystalline spines on her arms are in full view as she walks back to her chair.
^22f

Master Aradrine, hoping to gain the characters' trust by appearing vulnerable, provides the characters with the following information:

- A Consortium agent named [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) has infiltrated the archaeological site in Cael Morrow by posing as a member of the Allegiance of Allsight and befriending some Allegiance excavators.
- [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) reports that a rift has been opened in Cael Morrow, but no one can enter it without the proper key. Diviners hired by the Consortium claim that an object known as the Key to the Netherdeep, a greataxe encrusted with ruidium, lies somewhere in Cael Morrow.
- Aradrine fears that the Allegiance might be suspicious of [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) and doesn't want to risk losing the key.

Aradrine requests that the characters accomplish the following tasks and report back within three days:

- Enter Cael Morrow and avoid contact with Allegiance of Allsight personnel as much as possible.
- Rendezvous with [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md), who says she will be waiting inside Cael Morrow's Royal Library (area M7a in chapter 5).
- Secure the Key to the Netherdeep. (Unknown to Aradrine at this time, any ruidium weapon can be used as the key.)

Aradrine gives each character a stolen Allegiance of Allsight badge. These badges allow the characters to pose as Allegiance agents, enter Cael Morrow, and move around freely within the excavation site.

She promises the characters a reward of 1,000 gp for bringing back the Key to the Netherdeep.

#### Key Locations

This mission takes place primarily in Cael Morrow. Key locations the characters must visit are as follows:

- **Maw of Cael Morrow..** This location is the main entrance to the Drowned City (see the "Maw of Cael Morrow" section earlier in the chapter).

##### Royal Library Hall ({@area Chapter 5, Area M7a|2a1|x})

[Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) is here, searching for the Key to the Netherdeep. If three days pass before the characters reach this area, [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) has been found and killed by the characters' rivals, who are in league with the Allegiance of Allsight.

##### Cliffside Villa ({@area Chapter 5, Area M13|2be|x})

This site holds the Key to the Netherdeep: a ruidium greataxe. If three days pass before the characters reach this location, the key has already been removed by the characters' rivals.

If the rivals obtain the Key of the Netherdeep, they bring it to the Allegiance of Allsight's base camp in Cael Morrow (area M3 in chapter 5). The rivals are tasked with guarding the key but would sooner surrender than be killed for it.

#### Success

If the characters return to Aradrine with the Key to the Netherdeep, she takes it off their hands for further study and gives them their reward.

### Consortium Mission 5: Slay the Aboleth

Seven days after the characters successfully complete mission 4, Aradrine invites them to her home to brief them on a new mission. First, she conveys the following information:

- Cael Morrow contains a rift to the Netherdeep, the source of all ruidium.
- The rift is guarded by an aboleth that believes it is the Apotheon, a hero of legend.

Aradrine asks the characters to enter Cael Morrow and slay the aboleth, thus making it easier for the Consortium to salvage ruidium from the Netherdeep. Their reward for completing the mission is 1,000 gp.

#### Key Locations

This mission takes place primarily in Cael Morrow. Key locations in this mission include the following:

- **Maw of Cael Morrow..** This location is the main entrance to the Drowned City (see the "Maw of Cael Morrow" section earlier in the chapter).

##### Kelp Forest ({@area Chapter 5, Area M11|2b9|x})

The [Alyxian Aboleth](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/alyxian-aboleth-crcotn.md) lairs here, though the characters might encounter it elsewhere.

### Consortium Mission 6: Ruidium Monopoly

The final mission in this story track requires the characters to delve into the Netherdeep and ensure that the Consortium is the only faction in Ank'Harel that has access to ruidium.

Seven days after they successfully complete mission 5, Aradrine briefs the characters on their next assignment:

- To open Cael Morrow's rift to the Netherdeep, one needs a ruidium weapon (see appendix B). The Consortium has determined that any such weapon functions as a Key to the Netherdeep.
- The Allegiance of Allsight has sent agents into the rift. Their motives are unknown.

Aradrine asks the characters to accomplish the following tasks and report back before fourteen days have elapsed:

- Enter the Netherdeep. If the characters don't have at least one ruidium weapon in their possession to serve as a Key to the Netherdeep, Aradrine gives them the ruidium greataxe they retrieved in mission 4, assuming that mission was successful. (In its Exalted State, the Jewel of Three Prayers also enables travel through the rift.)
- Find the source of ruidium. If this source is a creature, make it an ally or capture it.

The reward for completion of this mission is a promotion to the rank of master within the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream, which comes with a salary of 1,000 gp per month.

#### Failure

Ultimately, this mission is doomed to fail. The characters can't give Aradrine what she wants. If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all ruidium ceases to exist; moreover, the characters can't hope to ally with the Apotheon until he is released, and releasing him when he is in his corrupted state makes an alliance with him impossible.

### Knowledge Is Power

This section details the missions in the Cobalt Soul Story Track, which are summarized in the accompanying flowchart.

#### Cobalt Soul Story Track

### Cobalt Soul Mission 1: The Cultist of Zehir

This introductory mission is used by the archivists of the Cobalt Soul to assess the characters' ability and potential value to the organization.

#### Getting the Mission

If the characters arrived in Ank'Harel with Question, the tiefling scholar they met in Bazzoxan in chapter 3, she greets them at their lodgings the morning after their arrival. Question knocks on the characters' door and cheerfully states that her superior, Iwo Zalarre (a chaotic good, half-orc [monastic operative](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/monastic-operative-crcotn.md); see appendix A), wants to speak with them. If the characters accept the meeting, Question takes them to the Temple of the Mentor, the headquarters of the Cobalt Soul in Ank'Harel (see "Temple of the Mentor" earlier in the chapter).

If the characters aren't invited to join the Cobalt Soul by Question, they can apply for membership by speaking to Iwo Zalarre at the Temple of the Mentor.

Read or paraphrase the following when the characters meet with Iwo Zalarre:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Iwo Zalarre stands at the edge of a balcony and points down at a pale wizard wearing academic robes. The wizard, who has numerous body piercings, seems to be minding his own business while reading a book. Next to him leans a staff topped with a carving of a snake's head.
> 
> Iwo whispers, "Our investigators report that this man is likely a cultist of Zehir the Cloaked Serpent, one of the Betrayer Gods. Your orders are to follow him back to his home and, without causing a scene, find out why he's here. If it's to cause trouble, apprehend him and turn him over to the Hands of Ord. Report back to me when you're done."
^243

The person of interest is a chaotic evil half-elf named [Laurin Ophidas](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laurin-ophidas-crcotn.md). He uses the [cult fanatic](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) stat block, with these changes:

- He has immunity to poison damage and the [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition.
- He wields a [staff of the adder](/compendium/items/staff-of-the-adder.md) and is attuned to it as though he were a cleric.

#### Ophidas's Motives

[Laurin Ophidas](/compendium/bestiary/npc/laurin-ophidas-crcotn.md) is a disgraced member of the Cerberus Assembly, an organization of spellcasters in the Dwendalian Empire in Wildemount. He fled from that organization after stealing a [staff of the adder](/compendium/items/staff-of-the-adder.md) from a superior. Convinced that the assembly's assassins are pursuing him, Ophidas is trying to locate other Zehir cultists in the city who will protect him. His search is not going well.

#### Following Ophidas

Shortly after the characters receive their orders, Ophidas leaves the Temple of the Mentor in a foul mood and hails a carriage to take him back to his lodgings in Scroll's Alcove, a stately apartment building in the Sigil District (see area S5 on the Streets of the Sigil District map). The characters can follow him in a carriage of their own, at a cost of 2 sp per rider.

#### Showdown

Characters who confront Ophidas can force him to divulge the information they seek in one of the following ways:

- A character can use an action to try to bully Ophidas into revealing his motives, doing so with a successful DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check.
- If Ophidas is reduced to half his hit points or fewer, he surrenders and answers any questions the characters put to him.

If the characters accost Ophidas in public, he hollers for the Hands of Ord. Five Hands of Ord [knights](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) arrive 3 rounds later. If the characters are still nearby when the Hands arrive, the guards try to arrest them and hold them overnight. If they don't resist, the characters are detained in a Sigil District jail, then released the next morning and assessed a fine of 50 gp each for disturbing the peace. While the characters are cooling their heels in jail, Ophidas (who is questioned by the Hands of Ord but not arrested) collects his belongings and disappears. The characters have no chance of finding him again.

##### Success

If the characters report back to Iwo with the truth about Ophidas's motives, Iwo assures the characters that they'll be called upon again in a few days' time and gives them one stone from a pair of [sending stones](/compendium/items/sending-stones.md) for future communication.

##### Failure

If the characters fail to learn Ophidas's motives before he disappears, Iwo says they must work their way up as librarians before he will give them another mission. Although this path might eventually lead to full membership, the characters know they can't wait that long to uncover the mysteries of the Apotheon, so they need to find another faction to join.

### Cobalt Soul Mission 2: Half-Baked Scheme

The characters' second mission for the Cobalt Soul requires them to stake out Old Man Kruuk, a half-orc baker suspected of being a purveyor of stolen goods. Their quiet surveillance explodes into a furious chase across the canals as the characters try to keep powerful magic out of the wrong hands.

#### Getting the Mission

Seven days after the characters successfully finish their first mission, Iwo Zalarre sends one of them a message via [sending stone](/compendium/items/sending-stones.md). Whichever character has the matching stone receives the message, which is as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Still interested in joining the Cobalt Soul? Meet me at the Temple of the Mentor. I have another mission for you."
^24b

When the characters reconnect with Iwo at the Temple of the Mentor, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Iwo shows you a map of the city, with a circle noting a location in the River District. "We suspect that a local baker named Kruuk is involved in the illegal sale of dangerous magic items, but we need proof before involving the Hands of Ord. The circle on the map shows where the bakery is located. We assume that Kruuk does all his black-market business after sundown, when the bakery closes. I suggest you wait until then to approach the place."
^24c

Iwo asks the characters to accomplish the following tasks:

- Obtain proof that Old Man Kruuk is selling magic items on the black market.
- Confiscate any magic items found at Kruuk's bakery and bring them to Iwo.

Iwo pays the characters 250 gp up front, with the promise of an additional 250 gp if they obtain proof that Kruuk is selling magic items and another 250 gp for each magic item retrieved from his bakery.

#### Kruuk Makes a Deal

While outwardly appearing as a kindly, elderly baker, Old Man Kruuk runs an efficient operation as a fence for stolen goods (see "Old Man Kruuk's" earlier in the chapter). His exploits have earned him connections with not only petty thieves but also professional mercenaries and black-market spellcasters.

#### River District Canal Map

The River District Canal map shows the following locations:

- **Q1 Old Man Kruuk's..** This establishment is described in the "Bakery by the Canal" section below.
- **Q2 Trees..** Several giant cedar trees grow in this district.
- **Q3 Canal..** This 5-foot-deep, 20-foot-wide canal is one of many such watercourses in the River District. The canals have ropes or bridges over them to make pedestrian travel through the district easier.

#### Bakery by the Canal

When the characters arrive at Old Man Kruuk's bakery shortly after sunset, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The soft sound of water lapping against canal banks is audible as you approach the building. Scents of honey and rose mingle with the smell of freshly cut grass. "Old Man Kruuk's" is painted in large letters above the door, and a sign hanging from the door's handle reads, "Sorry, we're closed! See you in the morning!"
^250

Inspecting the building's front and making a successful DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check enables a character to notice that the sign hanging from the door's handle is surrounded by a field of colored dots. The dots seem erratically placed to the untrained eye, but a character who knows thieves' cant recognizes the pattern as part of a code, identifying this place as a repository of stolen goods. The sign alone, however, is not enough to prove that Kruuk is trafficking in illicit magic items.

##### Q1a: Bakery Shop

The front door is unlocked, and a small silver bell on the door jingles as it's opened. Unsold items are still sitting in their display cases. Old Man Kruuk, a neutral, half-orc [bandit captain](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md), sits behind the counter, counting the day's proceeds.

The entry bell spoils any chance of the characters entering undetected. While some characters keep Kruuk occupied, another character can sneak away by making a successful DC 13 Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check.

If the characters try to engage Kruuk in conversation, he replies that the bakery is closed but offers to sell them some leftover tarts or rolls before they go.

A character who speaks to Kruuk in thieves' cant or succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check earns his trust, whereupon he divulges that a "magic shortsword" has recently come into his possession and that he plans to sell it later tonight (see "A Deal Goes Down" below). If the characters express interest in buying the weapon, Kruuk asks them to wait until his buyer arrives, after which he'll sell the blade to the highest bidder. If a character fails the check, Kruuk says nothing about the magic shortsword or his illegal business.

##### Q1b: Bakery

Kruuk's bakery is filthy, with waste bins filled with moldy dough and stale flatbread. Behind a table on the north wall is a secret door that leads to his back room (area Q1e). A character who examines the wall and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds the hidden door, which can be opened by pushing on it.

##### Q1c: Bedroom

Kruuk's bedroom contains a writing desk and chair, a mattress on the floor, shelves covered with personal belongings, and a pair of 25-pound dumbbells. On the north wall hangs a full-body painting of a scantily clad tiefling. The painting conceals a door to his back room (area Q1e).

##### Q1d: Courtyard

In the center of Kruuk's property is a grass-covered courtyard. It has wooden doors leading to all four rooms surrounding it. These doors are locked, but any of them can be opened by using a key Kruuk keeps on his person. A lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 16 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md). A door can be broken down by a character who makes a successful DC 11 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

##### Q1e: Back Room

The exterior door on the west wall is locked. The lock can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md). The door can be broken down by a character who succeeds on a DC 11 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, but the noise alerts anyone in the building.

This room smells of decay, and iron manacles are bolted to the wall. There are stains of various sorts on the floor. The room contains jugs of water, loose pieces of jewelry, and crates that hold low-value stolen goods.

A character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check locates a metal lockbox stowed underneath an upside-down crate in a corner of the room. The lockbox can be opened by a character who makes a successful DC 21 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md). It can also be pried open with a successful DC 16 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. If the box is forced open, poison gas sprays outward, and the character who opened it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d10) poison damage and be [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour.

The lockbox holds the ruidium shortsword that Kruuk plans to sell (see "A Deal Goes Down" below). If the characters have gained Kruuk's trust, he opens the lockbox to show them the sword, then explains its magical properties (see appendix B).

#### A Deal Goes Down

Kruuk plans to meet one hour after sunset with [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md), a chaotic neutral, gnome [occult extollant](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-extollant-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) working for the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream. [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md) carries a pouch containing five peridots (500 gp each).

At the appointed time, [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md) arrives at Kruuk's bakery. If the characters haven't neutralized him, Kruuk leads [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md) to the back room (area Q1e) so she can examine the ruidium shortsword. If he has more than one potential buyer, Kruuk holds an impromptu auction in the back room and starts the bidding at 1,000 gp. [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md) can't afford to pay more than 2,500 gp for the shortsword, and she attacks anyone who bids over that amount. [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md) surrenders if she is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer.

If [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md) has been taken out of the equation, a character can convince Kruuk to sell the shortsword for 500 gp by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, either by threatening his life or by convincing him that the characters are interested in being repeat customers.

##### Urban Chase

The characters can wait to snatch the ruidium shortsword from [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md) after her deal with Kruuk is done, in which case [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md) tries to flee with the sword rather than fight, resulting in a chase (use the "chase rules" and the Urban Chase Complications table in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). If [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md) is caught, she fights to keep the ruidium shortsword but surrenders it if she is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer.

#### Returning to the Temple

Iwo is happy to receive the ruidium shortsword and hands over the agreed-upon reward in exchange for it. Iwo is careful not to touch the weapon bare-handed. (After examining the sword carefully for a few days, the monks of the Cobalt Soul destroy it to ensure that it doesn't corrupt anyone.) If the characters seem reluctant to part with the sword, Iwo warns them that the weapon might be dangerous to its wielder. If necessary, Iwo increases the reward to 1,000 gp, hoping the extra coin will convince the characters to part with the weapon.

If the characters have Kruuk, [Ashann](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashann-crcotn.md), or both in their custody, Iwo has the criminals detained until the Hands of Ord can be summoned to take them away.

#### Joining the Cobalt Soul

Seven days after the characters successfully complete this mission, the archivists of the Cobalt Soul deem them worthy and motivated enough to join their organization as full members. The characters receive a brief, congratulatory message from Iwo via [sending stone](/compendium/items/sending-stones.md). Membership comes with the following benefits:

- Each new member receives a monastic robe like those worn by other members of the Cobalt Soul. If the robe is lost or damaged, a replacement can be purchased at the Temple of the Mentor for 1 gp.
- Each new member receives free lodging in Ank'Harel for as long as their membership lasts. The lodging is of comfortable quality (see "Lodging" earlier in the chapter).
- New members can buy the following magic items at the Temple of the Mentor: a spell scroll of [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) (10 gp), a spell scroll of [divination](/compendium/spells/divination.md) (125 gp), a spell scroll of [commune](/compendium/spells/commune.md) (250 gp), and a pair of [sending stones](/compendium/items/sending-stones.md) (250 gp).

The characters can't receive any more missions from the Cobalt Soul unless they become members of the faction.

### Cobalt Soul Mission 3: Elephant Uproar

After the Cobalt Soul receives reports of strange happenings in the Suncut Bazaar, High Curator [Jamil A'alithiya](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jamil-aalithiya-crcotn.md) surmises that the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream must be making progress researching the crimson substance known as ruidium. Concerned about the potentially destructive repercussions if the Consortium learns how to use it, Jamil sends the characters to infiltrate the Consortium's headquarters.

#### Getting the Mission

The next time the characters visit the Temple of the Mentor, Iwo informs them that the high curator wants to speak with them. The high curator's office is on the third floor. When the characters enter it, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Seated at the wide table is a young man no older than thirty, with brown skin and hazel eyes. His white robes are adorned with blue designs.
> 
> He smiles warmly as you enter. "Please, shut the door behind you," he says, closing the book in front of him. "I am High Curator [Jamil A'alithiya](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jamil-aalithiya-crcotn.md), and I've heard much about you.
> 
> "We know that the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is experimenting with a red substance its leaders call ruidium. Rumor has it the substance comes from the ruins of Cael Morrow, the underwater city beneath Ank'Harel.
> 
> "I'm worried that the Consortium is tampering with powers beyond its control. That is why I would like you to infiltrate the Consortium's headquarters—a tavern called First Eclipse—and find out anything you can about its research on ruidium. If you happen to come across any magic items in the Consortium's possession, please confiscate them and bring them to our temple for examination and safekeeping."
^25c

[Jamil A'alithiya](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jamil-aalithiya-crcotn.md), a neutral good, human [monastic high curator](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/monastic-high-curator-crcotn.md) (see appendix A), offers a reward of 1,000 gp for completing the mission.

Although he suspects that the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream has begun crafting ruidium weapons and armor, Jamil keeps this information to himself for the time being. He is hoping the characters will either confirm or dispel his suspicions.

#### A Bazaar Encounter

When the characters arrive at the Suncut Bazaar, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The sound of wood splintering and cries of panic echo through the streets, then are suddenly drowned out by a trumpeting roar that heralds the arrival of two red, crystalline elephants. One smashes through a stall as the other strides a few paces behind its companion.
^25e

This combat encounter takes place on the Streets of the Suncut Bazaar map. The crystalline creatures are two [ruidium elephants](/compendium/bestiary/construct/ruidium-elephant-crcotn.md) (see their stat block earlier in the adventure). These elephants are running amok and must be destroyed before they cause any further damage.

The first elephant that drops to 0 hit points turns into a tiny marble elephant [figurine of wondrous power](/compendium/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-marble-elephant.md) with thin veins of ruidium running through it.

The second elephant crumbles into ruidium dust when reduced to 0 hit points. A character who makes a successful DC 17 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check determines that this elephant was created using magic, with a small amount of ruidium as a material component; in other words, it was never a magic item to begin with.

Once the elephants have been dispatched, the characters can follow the elephants' trail of destruction back to First Eclipse. The characters are familiar with this tavern if they've had dealings with the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.

#### Keeping the Figurine

The characters can keep the elephant figurine, but they would be wise not to use it, for the elephant it creates uses the [ruidium elephant](/compendium/bestiary/construct/ruidium-elephant-crcotn.md) stat block (see earlier in the chapter) and can't be controlled.

If the characters slay or redeem the Apotheon (see chapter 7), the figurine is rid of its ruidium corruption and functions like a normal [figurine of wondrous power (marble elephant)](/compendium/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-marble-elephant.md).

#### First Eclipse

The elephants were released by Khelkur the Gull, a neutral evil, dwarf [occult silvertongue](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-silvertongue-crcotn.md) who's one of the masters of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream. He and the bartender, Satzrak Runestrider, a neutral evil, blue dragonborn [occult extollant](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-extollant-crcotn.md) (see appendix A for both stat blocks), are in First Eclipse's taproom, celebrating the success of their experiment. The tavern is otherwise empty.

When the characters enter, Satzrak barks, "We're closed!" and expects the characters to leave at once. If they don't, Khelkur says, "Leave now, or meet your doom!"

Unless the characters leave immediately, Khelkur and Satzrak attack.

After the battle, any character who searches Khelkur finds a crumpled note stuffed in one of his pockets. This note, written by one of his colleagues, bears the following message in Common:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Master Khelkur,
> 
> Our attempts to gain access to the rift have been disastrous. An aboleth haunts the Drowned City. It slaughtered all but one member of our last expedition. The creature calls itself Alyxian—certainly not an aboleth name, but not one I am familiar with either. But know this: Cael Morrow is where we must focus our efforts, lest the Allegiance of Allsight claim the only known source of ruidium for itself.
> 
> Our key to the rift is lost, but we have a spy in the Drowned City searching for it. Meanwhile, we have decided to secure a new headquarters. Please see that First Eclipse is cleared out—and quickly—before the Hands of Ord search the place.
> 
> Humbly, Master Dendarron
^261

Characters who search First Eclipse find no magic items or other treasure. Consortium agents under Khelkur's command have already emptied the tavern of valuables and moved the faction's headquarters to a new location.

#### Returning to the Temple

Jamil welcomes the characters back to the Temple of the Mentor at the end of the mission. If they turn over Dendarron's note, the elephant figurine, or both, he gives them the promised reward of 1,000 gp.

The handwritten note from Master Dendarron (whom Jamil recognizes as one of the leaders of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream) makes it clear that the Consortium is keen to secure more ruidium, which is accessible only through a rift in Cael Morrow. Jamil informs the characters that he will contact allies in the Allegiance of Allsight and arrange safe passage for the characters into the Drowned City. Until they hear from him, the characters can do as they please.

### Cobalt Soul Mission 4: Allegiance Alliance

Seven days after they complete the previous mission, the characters are invited to the Temple of the Mentor to meet with High Curator [Jamil A'alithiya](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jamil-aalithiya-crcotn.md), who plans to send them on a mission in the Drowned City.

#### Getting the Mission

Read or paraphrase the following when the characters arrive at Jamil's study:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> As you enter his study, the high curator spreads his arms wide and softly says, "Welcome. I am glad to see you again.
> 
> "The Allegiance of Allsight has granted you access to Cael Morrow. The Allegiance's control of the excavation site is threatened by the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream, so it's important that we act quickly.
> 
> "Ruidium is a magical substance that corrupts everything it touches. It comes from a place called the Netherdeep, which can be reached by passing through a rift in the heart of Cael Morrow. I've been told that passage through the rift requires some sort of key, but I don't know what form the key takes.
> 
> "I fear further unrest in Ank'Harel so long as the rift exists. The Netherdeep must be sealed off or destroyed, lest ruidium continue to find its way into Ank'Harel. But first thing's first. We need that key."
^265

Jamil believes that the Allegiance of Allsight and the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream are acting selfishly by taking advantage of their access to the Netherdeep. He asks the characters to accomplish the following tasks and report back before seven days have elapsed:

- Enter Cael Morrow and rendezvous with Professor [Insight Acuere](/compendium/bestiary/npc/insight-acuere-crcotn.md) at the Allegiance of Allsight base camp.
- Earn [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)'s trust and learn how to access the Netherdeep.
- Acquire the "key" to the Netherdeep.

Jamil promises the characters a reward of 1,000 gp if they find a key to the Netherdeep.

At the end of the meeting, Jamil gives each character an Allegiance of Allsight badge on loan from that organization. These badges will allow them to enter Cael Morrow and move around freely within the excavation site.

#### Insight's Quest

The characters can meet [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) in the Allegiance base camp (area M3 in chapter 5). She tells them that her companions are searching for the writings of an ancient hero who tried to save Cael Morrow from destruction during the Calamity. Earlier expeditions found dozens of stone tablets from the period in question at the south end of the excavation site. Her team, however, no longer has the force of arms to fight the dangerous creatures that lurk in this region. If the characters can find more of these tablets and return them to her, she'll be grateful.

##### Insight's Reward

If the characters bring back the tablet from area M10 in chapter 5, [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) shares the following information:

- [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) reveals the location of the rift leading to the Netherdeep (area M17 in chapter 5) and informs the characters that weapons infused with ruidium can open this rift.
- [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) believes there might be keys to the rift in Cael Morrow—left behind by agents of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.

#### Key Locations

This mission takes place primarily in Cael Morrow. Key locations the characters must visit are as follows:

- **Maw of Cael Morrow..** This location is the main entrance to the Drowned City (see the "Maw of Cael Morrow" section earlier in the chapter).

##### Allegiance Base Camp ({@area Chapter 5, Area M3|28b|x})

This location is the heart of Allegiance operations in Cael Morrow.

##### Unstable Building ({@area Chapter 5, Area M10|2b5|x})

This location contains the tablet that [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) seeks.

##### Cliffside Villa ({@area Chapter 5, Area M13|2be|x})

The "key" to enter the Netherdeep can be any ruidium weapon. Such an item can be found in this sunken villa.

#### Returning to the Temple

If the characters complete the mission and return to Jamil, he gives them the 1,000 gp reward and requests that they await another summons in seven days' time.

### Cobalt Soul Mission 5: Enemy of Our Enemies

Seven days after the characters complete the previous mission, Jamil requests another meeting with them, during which he imparts the following information:

- Tensions between the Allegiance of Allsight and the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream have grown in the past seven days.
- The rift to the Netherdeep is guarded by an aboleth that believes it is the Apotheon of legend, defending its realm against invaders.
- The Apotheon is said to have died in Cael Morrow at the end of the Calamity. Perhaps the aboleth is, indeed, some bizarre manifestation of this fallen hero.

Jamil needs the characters to accomplish one of the following tasks and report back within three days:

- If the aboleth is truly Alyxian, it might listen to reason. The characters must inform the aboleth that they are not enemies of the Apotheon and convince it to allow them to enter the rift.
- If the first task can't be accomplished, the characters must slay the aboleth so they have easier access to the Netherdeep when the time comes.

Jamil's reward for this task is 1,000 gp. He promises he will continue researching the Netherdeep in hopes that he can help them make their eventual journey into it.

#### Key Locations

This mission takes place primarily in Cael Morrow. Key locations the characters must visit are as follows:

- **Maw of Cael Morrow..** This location is the main entrance to the Drowned City (see the "Maw of Cael Morrow" section earlier in the chapter).

##### Temple of the Arch Heart ({@area Chapter 5, Area M9|2ad|x})

This location is Alyxian's final prayer site. Accessing it is necessary to unlock the full power of the Jewel of Three Prayers.

##### Kelp Forest ({@area Chapter 5, Area M11|2b9|x})

The Alyxian Aboleth lairs here, though the characters might encounter the creature elsewhere.

##### Rift to the Netherdeep ({@area Chapter 5, Area M17|2ce|x})

This planar rift connects the Netherdeep with the Material Plane.

#### Negotiating with the Aboleth

The [Alyxian Aboleth](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/alyxian-aboleth-crcotn.md) attacks the characters on sight. As an action, a character claiming to be Alyxian's friend or ally can try to persuade the aboleth to leave the party alone, doing so with a successful DC 25 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, or DC 15 if that character presents the Jewel of Three Prayers.

If the check fails, the aboleth rails against the characters, bellowing, "I am Alyxian! I am the Apotheon! I am divine, I am invincible! I am beyond mortal ken!" The delusional monster attacks its foes ruthlessly.

If the check succeeds, the aboleth gurgles contentedly and says, "Then, my friends, I will join your fight and defeat our shared enemies, just as I did so long ago." The aboleth no longer attacks the characters and, if they request it, harries their rivals and any other adversaries they identify.

### Cobalt Soul Mission 6: Destroy the Netherdeep

The final mission in the Cobalt Soul Story Track requires the characters to enter the Netherdeep and try to destroy it from the inside.

Seven days after they return from the previous mission, the characters receive their next mission from Jamil, who imparts the following information:

- Both the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream and the Allegiance of Allsight are trying to stockpile ruidium. If the flow of ruidium out of the Netherdeep isn't cut off immediately, the consequences could be disastrous.
- The Consortium has sent a group of skilled adventurers into the Netherdeep. (This group is the rival party.)
- To survive the underwater pressure of the Netherdeep, one needs an item at least partially made of ruidium. (The Jewel of Three Prayers also allows its wearer to withstand the pressure.)

Jamil requests that the characters find a way to destroy the Netherdeep and report back to him before fourteen days have elapsed. Jamil says he can think of no reward appropriate for accomplishing a task of this magnitude, but he offers the characters 2,000 gp each and hopes that will suffice.

#### Success

This mission can succeed only if the characters slay or redeem Alyxian, thus destroying the Netherdeep and all ruidium in the process (see chapter 7 for details).
