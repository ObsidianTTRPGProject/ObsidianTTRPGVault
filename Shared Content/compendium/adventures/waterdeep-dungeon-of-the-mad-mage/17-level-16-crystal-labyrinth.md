# Level 16: Crystal Labyrinth
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, p. 209* 

Githyanki recently turned the Crystal Labyrinth into an outpost of their interplanar empire. It houses a gate to Stardock, a hollowed-out asteroid in orbit around the planet Toril (one of many that form the asteroid cluster known as the Tears of Selûne). Together, the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock are designed for four 14th-level characters. Those who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to advance halfway to 15th level.

Before running this level of Undermountain, you should review the "Gith" entry in the "Monster Manual", because it contains information that will help you roleplay githyanki effectively. Additional information about githyanki society can be found in "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes", although that resource is not required to run the Crystal Labyrinth.

## What Dwells Here?

Githyanki tracking a splinter colony of mind flayers to Undermountain seized this level and turned what was once a crystalline maze into a fortress. From here, they launch attacks against the mind flayers on level 17. The githyanki also transformed Stardock into a crèche: a fortress dedicated to raising and training young warriors. Because creatures do not age on the Astral Plane, the githyanki must bring their offspring to the Material Plane to mature. Unfamiliar with the asteroid's actual name, the githyanki refer to Stardock as Crèche K'liir.

Schend and published in 1997, was the third of three modules in the short-lived "Dungeon Crawl" series of adventures designed for the second edition D&D game. _Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage_ presents alternative versions of the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock scaled for fifth edition and this product. If you want to expand this level of Undermountain, the original adventure would be a fine source of inspiration.

### Githyanki

The militaristic githyanki who live in the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock have three important tasks: protect the crèche, train young githyanki warriors, and destroy the mind flayer colony in Seadeeps (level 17).

#### Knights and the Draconic Tongue

Githyanki knights encountered in the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock speak Draconic in addition to their native language of Gith—all the better to communicate with their red dragon mounts.

#### Githyanki Leaders

The githyanki are led by [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md), a knight who is cruel to her trainees and soldiers. [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) recently acquired a [manual of gainful exercise](/compendium/items/manual-of-gainful-exercise.md) and a [tome of clear thought](/compendium/items/tome-of-clear-thought.md), and she has promised to award both items to her most accomplished soldier. In truth, she plans to read these tomes to gain their benefits herself, but uses the promise of this reward to trick her troops into running themselves ragged. [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s second in command, Urlon, is tired of the abuse and plots against her.

### Red Dragons

[Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md), an adult red dragon, is mother to six young red dragons that live in the Crystal Labyrinth and defend Crèche K'liir. [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md)'s children are named Ashranthax, Blazutranc, Infernexus, Meteoranzym, Smoakcant, and Zolcharrx.

#### Astyrranthor

[Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) can't treat Stardock as her lair, so she has no lair actions here. However, she has the following Innate Spellcasting trait:

##### Innate Spellcasting

[Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md)'s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

1/day each: [alarm](/compendium/spells/alarm.md), [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [gaseous form](/compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md), [misty step](/compendium/spells/misty-step.md), [passwall](/compendium/spells/passwall.md), [see invisibility](/compendium/spells/see-invisibility.md)

[Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) spends most of her time on the outer surface of the asteroid, prowling through the wreckage of spacefaring vessels that crashed into Stardock long ago. If combat breaks out inside Crèche K'liir, there is a 10|10 percent% chance chance that she hears the disturbance. She investigates immediately, joining the battle in progress and using her [gaseous form](/compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md), [misty step](/compendium/spells/misty-step.md), and [passwall](/compendium/spells/passwall.md) spells to enter hard-to-reach locations. [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) also keeps a specific watch over areas 12f, 13, and 16a from outside the asteroid. If she sees trouble or intruders in those areas, she attacks at once.

> [!quote] Crystal Golems
> 
> Crystal golems found throughout the Crystal Labyrinth look like 10-foot-tall githyanki warriors. They understand Gith but can't speak, and they attack any creatures that don't look like githyanki or red dragons. Each [crystal golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md) is a stone golem with these additional traits:
> 
> **Illumination.** The golem magically sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light goes out when the golem is destroyed.
> 
> **Light Intensity.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the illuminated golem and can see the golem must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the start of the creature's next turn.
> 
> A creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the golem until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the golem in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

## Crystal Dungeon

All area descriptions for this location are keyed to map 16. As one descends from level 15 or climbs up from level 17, the rough stone walls, floor, and ceiling give way to ever-widening veins of luminous crystal until every surface is made of the substance. In many areas, the githyanki have torn down the crystalline walls to create larger spaces.

Unless otherwise noted, the crystal dungeon has the following unique features:

- The dungeon is brightly lit throughout. The crystal walls, ceilings, and floor emit magical light that changes color every 10 minutes, shifting through all the hues of the rainbow.
- Doors are carved from single slabs of opaque white crystal similar in weight and consistency to stone.

### 1. Entry Hall

A [crystal golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md) (see the "Crystal Golems" sidebar) stands guard here. It attacks any creature not escorted by a githyanki or a red dragon. If combat erupts here, the githyanki warriors from area 2a investigate.

### 2. Western Cavern

The githyanki knocked down several walls to create this chamber, and much of the debris has yet to be cleared.

#### 2a. Ilmei's Watch

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Crystal Stalactite**. A 10-foot-long crystal stalactite hangs above a pit filled with silvery mist. Encased in the stalactite is Ilmei, a female [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A for statistics; see also "Crystal Stalactites").
> 
> **Guards**. Around the pit, four [githyanki warriors](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) (two males and two females) spar with each other to pass the time.
^82e

Fresh out of Crèche K'liir, the young githyanki warriors are hostile toward intruders. If two of them fall, the remaining ones retreat to area 3b or dive into the pit.

Creatures that fall into the pit are immediately transported to the Astral Plane (see "chapter 2" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more information).

#### 2b. Dragon Engravings

The walls of this chamber are engraved with images of armored githyanki knights riding red dragons.

#### 2c. Illithid Heads

Twelve severed mind flayer heads are mounted on the east and west walls of this partially destroyed area. A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of necromancy magic around each head, which is a Tiny object with AC 5, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a head to 0 hit points destroys it. Whenever a head is destroyed, any remaining mind flayer heads in the area that haven't been destroyed emit a telepathic scream. Each creature in the room takes 1d6 psychic damage for each screaming head (maximum 12d6).

### 3. Main Cavern

Githyanki twins named Arbez and Surlock are contained within crystal stalactites in this cavern.

#### 3a. Arbez's Watch

The creatures in area 3b investigate any disturbance in this portion of the cavern, which contains the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Crystal Stalactite**. A 10-foot-long crystal stalactite hangs above a pit filled with silvery mist. Encased in the stalactite is Arbez, a male [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A for statistics; see also "Crystal Stalactites").
> 
> **Straw Dummies**. Five freestanding straw dummies with the rough forms of mind flayers (marked X on map 16) stand north of the pit.
^833

Creatures that fall into the pit are immediately transported to the Astral Plane (see "chapter 2" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more information).

Githyanki warriors use the straw dummies as targets in combat training exercises. Each is a Medium object with AC 10, 10 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.

> [!quote] Crystal Stalactites
> 
> Four githyanki gish (see appendix A) are encased in transparent crystal stalactites in areas 2, 3, and 6. While encased, these githyanki remain aware of their surroundings but don't require air, food, or water. Until the crystal around them is destroyed, they can't be targeted by attacks or subjected to magical effects. Moreover, they are [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and can't use their War Magic feature or make longsword attacks. They cast spells through the crystal as though it wasn't there.
> 
> Each crystal stalactite is a Large inanimate object with AC 15, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A stalactite reduced to 0 hit points shatters, freeing the githyanki within. A githyanki whose stalactite is destroyed is no longer [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and falls into the pit of silvery mist below it, whereupon it returns to the Astral Plane.
^crystal-stalactites

#### 3b. Surlock's Watch

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Crystal Stalactite**. A 10-foot-long crystal stalactite hangs above a pit filled with silvery mist. Encased in the stalactite is Surlock, a male [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A for statistics; see also the "Crystal Stalactites" sidebar).
> 
> **Knight and Dragon**. Near the eastern edge of the pit, a female [githyanki knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) named Deslarr sits astride Ashranthax, a female [young red dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md).
^836

If they are not alerted to the characters' presence, Deslarr and the dragon chat in Draconic about how many illithids they must kill to prove themselves worthy of "[Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s magic books." They fight to the death.

Creatures that fall into the pit are immediately transported to the Astral Plane (see "chapter 2" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more information).

##### Treasure

Deslarr carries a _Stardock rod_ (see "Stardock Rods"). Her plate armor is set with eight black jaspers (50 gp each) and eight amber gemstones (100 gp each).

### 4. Barracks

Ten beds with pale white crystal frames are set along the walls. At any given time, ten [githyanki warriors](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) are resting in this area. If they have not been alerted, the githyanki are asleep when the characters arrive. They are hostile toward intruders and fight to the death.

### 5. Prison Cell

The crystal doors to this room are magically locked, but they open automatically for any creature that carries a _Stardock rod_ (see "Stardock Rods"). There are no physical locks to be picked, but a [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic also opens a door.

Magic wards in the room prevent any creature from teleporting into or out of it.

#### Marquox

A [mind flayer](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) named Marquox uses its [levitate](/compendium/spells/levitate.md) spell to float in the center of this otherwise empty room. It was captured while it searched this level for its companions, Tel'zact and Yeluit (see area 29c).

Marquox doesn't know why the githyanki are keeping it alive, but it knows it won't survive long in their captivity. If the characters don't attack it at once, Marquox proposes a deal. If they free it and help it rescue its companions, Marquox guarantees the party safe passage through level 17. A successful DC 16 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check reveals that the illithid has no intention of making good on its promise. If the githzerai zerths from level 15 are with the party, they refuse to help the mind flayer and insist that the characters kill it. If the characters choose Marquox over them, the githzerai abandon the party and withdraw to level 15.

Marquox knows about Stardock but has never visited the asteroid. It also knows that the gate to Stardock is in area 11, and that a black crystal rod is needed to activate it. If the characters allow it, Marquox follows them to Stardock, fighting alongside them until it reunites with its kin. At that point, the mind flayers either turn against the party (if the characters appear weak) or lure the characters to the mind flayer colony on level 17, where Extremiton (the colony's ulitharid leader) can decide what to do with them.

### 6. Eastern Cavern

The githyanki knocked down several walls to create this chamber, and much of the debris remains.

#### 6a. Mirrk's Watch

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Crystal Stalactite**. A 10-foot-long crystal stalactite hangs above a pit filled with silvery mist. Encased in the stalactite is Mirrk, a female [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A for statistics; see also "Crystal Stalactites").
> 
> **Guards**. Unless they have been lured elsewhere, six [githyanki warriors](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) (three females and three males) stand guard around the edge of the pit in the squares marked W on map 16.
^83d

The warriors speak in Gith about their dislike of [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) and their respect for Urlon. They are hostile toward intruders and fight until three or more of them fall, whereupon the remaining warriors retreat to area 7 or dive into the pit.

Creatures that fall into the pit are immediately transported to the Astral Plane (see "chapter 2" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more information).

#### 6b. Scrying Chamber

The north wall of this chamber hums and glows purple. A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of divination magic radiating from the wall. Any creature that spends 1 minute touching the wall can cast the [scrying](/compendium/spells/scrying.md) spell targeting the ulitharid on level 17, using the wall as a focus. A character who examines the wall can, with a successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check, ascertain that it's a scrying device and figure out how it works.

### 7. Anti-Illithid Defense

Two crystal golems (see "Crystal Golems") guard this room. They attack any creature that enters this area unescorted by a githyanki, a [crystal golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md), or a red dragon. If combat breaks out in this chamber, the githyanki warriors in area 6a come to investigate.

A permanent enchantment in this chamber grants any creature in the area advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and causes the [levitate](/compendium/spells/levitate.md) and [detect thoughts](/compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spells to automatically fail when cast.

### 8. Officer Quarters

Four beds with pale white crystal frames are set along the walls. A male [githyanki knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) named Eshant and a male [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A) named Theru stand in the middle of the room, engaged in a tense debate. Characters who get close to this area without alerting the githyanki hear the two arguing in Gith about which of them is worthier of "[Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s magic books." The debate is intense but stops short of physical violence. If the characters don't interrupt, the gish eventually backs down and withdraws to area 9 to cool his heels. Eshant and Theru attack intruders on sight.

#### Treasure

Eshant and Theru carry one _Stardock rod_ apiece (see "Stardock Rods").

Eshant's plate armor is set with six black jaspers (50 gp each) and six red spinels (100 gp each). Eshant also carries a [potion of greater healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) in a crystal vial worn on a thin platinum chain (25 gp) around his neck.

### 9. Trophy Room

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Stuffed Ulitharid**. A 10-foot-tall, stuffed ulitharid (see appendix A) stands in a 15-foot-high alcove along the south wall of the room.
> 
> **Illithid Heads**. Fifteen mounted mind flayer heads decorate the walls.
^843

### 10. Golem Laboratory

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Urlon**. Urlon, a male [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A), is using a set of mason's tools to carve the head of a half-completed [crystal golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md) lying atop a 10-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, 4-foot-high table in the west side of the room.
> 
> **Golem**. A [crystal golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md) (see "Crystal Golems") stands guard in the east side of the room, surrounded by shelves stacked with books, spell components, pieces of crystal, and mind flayer skulls.
^845

The [crystal golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md) doesn't attack unless Urlon orders it to do so, or if the characters attack it or Urlon first.

Urlon does not attack the characters unless he has no other choice. Believing that his superior, [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md), is a tyrant unfit for command, he tries to use the characters to eliminate her. This is true even if the characters are accompanied by githzerai from level 15; unlike most githyanki, Urlon sympathizes with githzerai and doesn't regard them with utter contempt.

If the characters are willing to listen, Urlon tells them in Common that [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) keeps two magic tomes meant to enhance strength and intellect in a chest in her quarters on Crèche K'liir. If the characters offer to kill [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md), Urlon opens the gate in area 11 for them. Urlon won't accompany the characters, however, since doing so would surely compromise his ability to assume command once [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) is dead. He doesn't care whether they keep [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s magic books or not.

To earn the characters' trust, Urlon answers any questions they have about the current state of the Crystal Labyrinth and the asteroid. If the characters attack him, Urlon retreats to Stardock by way of the gate in area 11 while the [crystal golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md) covers his escape.

#### Treasure

Urlon carries a _Stardock rod_ (see "Stardock Rods"), a set of mason's tools, and a green crystal wand (his arcane focus).

Amid the worthless skulls, spell components, and crystal fragments on the shelves are several books of interest:

- Wedged between red crystal bookends carved in the likeness of red dragons (250 gp for the pair) is a six-volume doctrine of planar philosophy written in Common titled _The Spectrum of Multiversal Beliefs_, which delves deeply into the conflicting cosmic philosophies of several different planar factions. Each volume is worth 250 gp separately, but the complete set is worth 2,500 gp.
- Stacked one atop another are three identical spellbooks shared by the githyanki gish. Each of these books contains the spells that Urlon and his fellow gish normally prepare (see appendix A), plus [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [fabricate](/compendium/spells/fabricate.md), [haste](/compendium/spells/haste.md), [hold person](/compendium/spells/hold-person.md), and [shield](/compendium/spells/shield.md).

### 11. Stardock Gate

The crystal doors to this room are magically locked, but they open automatically for any creature that carries a _Stardock rod_ (see "Stardock Rods"). There are no physical locks to be picked, but a [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic also opens a door.

The room contains the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Golem**. A [crystal golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md) (see "Crystal Golems") stands in the southernmost section of the room. It attacks any creature not escorted by a githyanki, a [crystal golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/crystal-golem-wdmm.md), or a red dragon.
> 
> **Gate to Stardock**. In the western section of the room, a stone arch set with glowing red crystals is embedded in the south wall.
> 
> **Pedestal**. Rising from the floor 10 feet in front of the arch is a 3-foot-high pedestal made of red crystal with a small hole in the top.
^848

Together, the arch and pedestal comprise a teleportation gate. The hole bored into the top of the pedestal is 1 inch wide and 6 inches deep. When a _Stardock rod_ (see "Stardock Rods") is inserted into the hole, the solid wall inside the arch disappears for 1 minute, replaced by an open doorway to area 12a. This magic gate remains open while the rod is in place and closes 1 minute after the rod is removed from the pedestal. While the gate is open, creatures in this room can clearly see into area 12a, and vice versa.

The pedestal and the archway are impervious to damage, and the red crystals embedded in the arch can't be removed. The first time a creature tries to pry a crystal from the arch, a random elder rune appears above the pedestal, targets a random creature within 60 feet of it, then disappears (see "Elder Runes"). Determine the elder rune randomly by drawing a card from the Elder Runes Deck (see appendix B).

> [!quote] Stardock Rods
> 
> A _Stardock rod_ is a 1-foot-long black crystal rod that is needed to open the magic gate in area 11 and its corresponding gate in area 12a. A _Stardock rod_ weighs 1 pound, radiates an aura of conjuration magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell, and has no other magical properties.

## Stardock

All area descriptions for this location are keyed to map 16.

Originally carved by dragons, the asteroid known as Stardock orbits the planet Toril—one of hundreds that form the asteroid belt known as the Tears of Selûne. Over ages, illithids, undead mages, and spacefaring pirates have fought over and expanded Stardock's halls, but the asteroid was long abandoned by the time the githyanki and their red dragon allies moved in. The asteroid's features are as follows:

- The restrictions on magic in Undermountain don't apply here, since Stardock is outside the dungeon.
- Interior areas are brightly lit by [continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md) spells cast on crumbling stone wall sconces.
- Tunnels have 20-foot-high arched ceilings, and rooms have flat 25-foot-high ceilings, unless otherwise noted. Staircases are carved out of solid rock and are 30 feet high and 30 feet long. Walls and ceilings are roughly hewn, and floors are smooth.
- The asteroid magically generates breathable air that fills Stardock's interior and extends out 120 feet from the asteroid. Beyond this range is the airless void of space. A creature can survive in space for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round) before it dies.
- The temperature inside the asteroid's air envelope is 70 degrees Fahrenheit unless otherwise noted.
- An [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) gravity plane cuts through the asteroid along its equator, as illustrated in the Side View of the asteroid on map 16. Creatures and objects inside the asteroid's air envelope fall toward this gravity plane. Creatures and objects inside the asteroid fall toward the floor, as normal.
- There are no cardinal directions (north, south, east, or west) in Stardock or in space, and compasses don't function here.

Creatures can propel themselves through space using magic such as [fly](/compendium/spells/fly.md) spells, but wings and other non-magical means of propulsion are useless in the frictionless void.

### 12. Dragons' Domain

[Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) and her six children make their home here. Magic keeps the temperature at 120 degrees Fahrenheit throughout these chambers, making it perfect for the dragons' comfort. Characters who stay in this area for more than 1 hour suffer the effects of extreme heat (see "chapter 5" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

#### 12a. Arch Gate

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Ceiling**. This room has a 30-foot-high, domed ceiling.
> 
> **Scales**. The floor is littered with red dragon scales.
> 
> **Gate to the Crystal Labyrinth**. A stone arch set with glowing red crystals is embedded in the back wall of an alcove.
> 
> **Pedestal**. Rising from the floor 10 feet in front of the arch is a 3-foot-high pedestal made of red crystal with a small hole in the top.
^84d

Inserting a _Stardock rod_ (see the "Stardock Rods," sidebar) into the hole in the pedestal creates an open doorway inside the arch that leads to area 11. The pedestal and archway are otherwise identical to those in area 11.

Any character who examines the scales and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check realizes that the scales came from multiple owners. Most were shed by an adult red dragon, while a few were cast off by one or more young red dragons.

#### 12b. Tiamat Shrine

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Tapestries**. Two beautiful tapestries hang on the walls.
> 
> **Carving**. Carved into the floor is a stylized, 15-foot-diameter disk-shaped engraving of Tiamat, her five chromatic dragon heads spewing their breath weapons.
^84f

One tapestry depicts Tiamat combating twelve storm giants. The other shows Tiamat battling a bearded and bloodied old man in wizard robes with seven golden canaries circling his head. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the old man as a representation of Bahamut, the god of good dragons, in human form, and the seven canaries as his polymorphed gold dragon advisors.

##### Treasure

Each tapestry is 20 feet on a side, weighs 25 pounds, and is worth 750 gp intact.

#### 12c. False Hatchery

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Lava Curtain**. A 30-foot-wide curtain of lava along one wall drains into a pool 1 foot deep, 30 feet long, and 10 feet wide. A secret door stands behind the lava curtain, opening into area 12d. The characters can't open or pass through the secret door without coming into contact with the lava.
> 
> **Eggs**. Six red-speckled dragon eggs sit in the lava pool.
^852

The lava curtain is created magically but is not itself magical. A creature that enters the lava for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) fire damage.

Each egg is 4 feet tall, hollow, and 500 pounds. A character who inspects the eggs closely and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check realizes that they are fakes made of polished stone.

#### 12d. Dragon Hatchery

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Lava Pool**. The entire floor is a 1-foot-deep pool of lava. The lava is created magically but is not itself magical. A creature that enters the lava floor for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) fire damage.

> **Egg**. A red-speckled dragon egg rests in the lava near the chamber's curved wall.
^854

The red dragon egg stands 4 feet high and weighs 250 pounds. To properly develop, the egg must spend another six months in an environment of extreme heat. When the egg hatches, a [red dragon wyrmling](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling.md) emerges. The wyrmling is loyal to no one except itself. If the characters steal the egg, [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) and every other dragon of her line will hunt the characters until the egg is recovered.

#### 12e. False Hoard

Loud noises in this area alert the denizens of areas 12f and 13, who remain where they are but can't be surprised.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Illusion**. A 20-foot-wide, 4-foot-high pile of coins, jewels, and art objects lies on the floor in the 20-foot-square area marked on map 16. The treasure pile is an illusion that can be dispelled (DC 16). A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals its illusory nature. The treasure has no substance, so any physical interaction with the pile also reveals that it's an illusion.
> 
> **Scales**. The floor around the treasure pile is littered with cast-off red dragon scales.
> 
> **Statues**. Two 20-foot-tall, gilded statues of dragons of an unknown type stand along one wall.
^856

Characters who examine the scales can tell that they came from a red dragon. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check realizes that the scales came from multiple dragons. Most were shed by an adult red dragon, while a few were cast off by one or more young red dragons.

The ancient statues testify to the unknown draconic creators of this chamber. They are impervious to damage, which prevents any of their gold leaf from being removed.

#### 12f. Dragons' Hoard

The characters hear the strumming of a lute (see area 13) as they approach this rough-hewn cave, the contents of which are as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Hoard**. An enormous pile of coins and gems fills this chamber. Sleeping under this hoard are two male [young red dragons](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md) named Blazutranc and Meteoranzym.
> 
> **Tunnel**. A wide tunnel strewn with cast-off red dragon scales breaks through the outer shell of the asteroid and forms a ledge overlooking the planet Toril.
^858

Blazutranc and Meteoranzym are slumbering beneath the treasure pile. Characters who approach quietly and succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check spot the gleaming red scales of the dragons beneath the treasure. When they become aware of intruders, the dragons fight until one of them is reduced to 60 hit points, whereupon they both leave the asteroid in search of their mother, [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md).

##### Treasure

The hoard consists of 249,280 cp, 121,472 sp, 11,302 ep, 6,025 gp, 200 pp, two ambers (100 gp each), four coral branches (250 gp each), two spinels (100 gp each), three bloodstones (50 gp each), five hematites (10 gp each), an old painting of a dwarf miner (25 gp), and a bear mask made of jade (250 gp).

### 13. Jerath's Quarters

Characters who heard the strumming lute in area 12f can follow the music to this chamber, which contains the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Jeath**. Jerath, a [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) [githyanki knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) with no eyes or armor (AC 12), sits in a chair strumming a lute. His greatsword leans against a wall within easy reach.
> 
> **Furnishings**. A lavish wood-framed bed stands near the wall across from four 2-foot-high, 6-inch-wide window slits. By peering through the slits, one can see the starry void of space beyond.
^85b

Jerath lost his eyes in a battle against the ulitharid on display in area 9. He saved [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md)'s life when she was a wyrmling, and she has cared for him since his injury. Characters who speak Gith and succeed on a DC 12 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check can convince Jerath that they are githyanki. Jerath shares any information he knows with fellow githyanki, including the layout of Stardock, the unhappiness of the young dragon Infernexus, and [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s cruelty.

If Jerath believes the characters are not githyanki, he tries to keep them in this area with conversation or a song. He knows that [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) crawls by the window slits once every 10 minutes to check on him. If she sees or smells intruders in Jerath's presence, she storms into area 12f, makes her way here, and dispatches them.

### 14. Infernexus's Quarters

The unhappiest of [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md)'s brood, a male [young red dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md) named Infernexus, claims this chamber as his lair. The dragon sleeps across from the door underneath four 2-foot-high, 6-inch-wide window slits that peer into the starry void.

[Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md)'s youngest child is miserable on Stardock. He is eager to leave the asteroid and begin life on his own, but his mother insists he help the githyanki. So he spends most of his time here, sleeping or darkly staring out into space.

If the characters do not attack him at once, Infernexus proposes a deal. He helps them achieve their goals in the asteroid if they promise to kill his mother and help him carve out a lair for himself in Undermountain. He's very particular and doesn't consider any lair other than the Twisted Caverns (level 4) suitable. If a deal is struck, Infernexus becomes the characters' loyal companion for 1d10 days. But if they haven't gotten the dragon to the Twisted Caverns by then, he betrays them.

If the characters attack Infernexus or refuse his deal, he fights until reduced to 100 hit points or fewer. He then screams for his mother, who hears the call and arrives at the window slits 1d4 + 1 rounds later.

### 15. Githyanki Trainees

Githyanki children are brought to the crèche to grow, train, and study in these connected caverns.

#### 15a. Training Area

If the characters make any loud noise here, the [githyanki knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) in area 15b investigates. This cavern has the following features:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Straw Dummies**. Straw dummies crafted to resemble mind flayers stand near the center of the chamber.
> 
> **Apparatus**. A large climbing apparatus made of black steel is mounted to one wall.
> 
> **Inscriptions**. Gith inscriptions cover the remaining walls. (They recount crimes perpetrated by the githzerai and the mind flayers against the githyanki.)
^85f

The straw dummies are used for combat practice. Each is a Medium object with AC 10, 10 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.

#### 15b. Tutor's Quarters

A male [githyanki knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) named Kaaltav dwells in this area. If not already alerted, the knight sleeps in a canopied four-poster and wakes at any loud noise. If he is alerted, the knight moves to area 15a to keep intruders from harming the children in area 15c.

##### Treasure

Kaaltav's plate armor is set with six zircons (50 gp each) and six violet garnets (100 gp each).

#### 15c. Githyanki Quarters

Twenty githyanki children (noncombatants) sleep in small stone-framed beds in this room. Any movement in the room wakes 1d6 of them, who see the characters and shout out in alarm. The githyanki knight in area 15b arrives 1 round later as the other young awake. While the knight fights the characters, the githyanki young run throughout the crèche and raise the alarm.

### 16. Nursery

Infant githyanki are brought to the crèche shortly after birth and raised in this nursery until they are old enough to undertake their training.

#### 16a. Sleeping Area

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Children**. Forty githyanki infants (noncombatants) sleep in crystal cradles arranged in five rows of eight.
> 
> **Window Slits**. Four 2-foot-long, 6-inch-wide window slits reveal the starry void of space beyond.
^865

A creature moving through this chamber must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to avoid waking the sleeping infants. On a failed check, or if any loud noise occurs in this area, the infant githyanki wake and begin to cry. Both githyanki knights in area 16b investigate quickly.

[Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) crawls by the window slits once every 10 minutes to check on the area. If she sees intruders here but the infant githyanki appear safe, she holds off attacking for fear of harming them. As soon as the intruders move into another area of Stardock, the dragon uses her magic or her burrowing speed to enter the asteroid and attack them.

#### 16b. Nursery Guardians

Two [githyanki knights](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md), a male named Ir'rigo and a female named Kritinaya, sleep in wooden beds against the walls. Any loud noise wakes the knights, who fight to the death against intruders.

##### Treasure

Ir'rigo's plate armor is set with six orange carnelians (50 gp each) and six amethysts (100 gp each). Kritinaya's plate armor is set with eight lapis lazuli gemstones (50 gp each) and two blue spinels (500 gp each).

### 17. War Wizards

Gish live and train in this section of Crèche K'liir.

#### 17a. Gish Study

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Furnishings**. Six cushioned chairs form a circle around a brazier of purple fire at the center of the room.
> 
> **Gish**. A female [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A) named Vheza sits in one chair, reading a tome.
^86a

If Vheza sees intruders, she flees to area 17b with her book and makes her stand there.

##### Treasure

The book that Vheza is reading is written in Gith and titled _The Ascension of Vlaakith_. It chronicles Vlaakith the Lich-Queen's rise to power in githyanki society and postulates that her absolute rulership would have been impossible had she not mastered arcane magic. The book also discusses the importance of wizardry as a githyanki tool for defeating their enemies and conquering the multiverse. The tome is worth 50 gp.

#### 17b. Gish Quarters

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Beds**. Six beds framed in white metal stand in a row down the center of the rough-walled room.
> 
> **Gish**. Two female [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A) named Evir and Hraznin sit on beds and debate the finer points of magic. Each gish uses a crystal orb as an arcane focus and fights to the death.
> 
> **Window Slits**. Four 2-foot-long, 6-inch-wide window slits offer views of stars, the planet Toril, and the occasional spectacular sunrise.
^86d

#### 17c. Arcane Training Ground

The scorched remains of straw dummies crafted to resemble illithids are scattered around this rough-walled octagonal room. Burn marks from spell training cover the walls, floor, and ceiling.

### 18. Library

The githyanki keep a modest library of books and maps on shelves carved into the asteroid's rock walls. These shelves run from the floor to the 15-foot-high ceiling of each chamber. Most githyanki use [mage hand](/compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) to reach higher shelves, but a character can climb a shelf with a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### 18a. Book Collections

The walls of this cavern and the two columns that support the roof are lined with books. All the volumes here are in Gith and concern the githyanki's history battling illithids and githzerai (see the "Gith" entry in the "Monster Manual").

#### 18b. Map Room

The shelves along the walls of this cavern are piled high with leather and bone tubes holding maps of planar locations and small, unnamed dungeons. A character who searches through the maps for 1 hour and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discovers a recently updated map of Stardock, though none of the asteroid's rooms are labeled.

#### 18c. Reading Room

Two cushioned chairs in this rough-walled room face 2-foot-long, 6-inch-wide window slits through which can be seen the void of space.

### 19. Warehouse

Food, water, and other supplies for the inhabitants of the crèche are stored here.

#### 19a. Loading Dock

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Warriors**. Four [githyanki warriors](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) are organizing crates and setting aside food for the kitchen. They attack in response to any threat or suspicious activity. If two githyanki fall, the survivors retreat to area 21.
> 
> **Containers**. Stacked about the room are forty crates filled with nonperishable food and forty barrels of fresh water.
> 
> **Beams**. Two thick wooden beams lean against the wall between sets of double doors.
^875

The food crates are each 2 feet on a side and weigh 50 pounds. The water barrels are 4 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds each. As an action, a creature can attempt a DC 22 Strength check to push over a stack of crates or barrels. A successful check triggers a domino effect, causing all the stacks to fall. Each creature on the floor of the room when the stacks topple must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone).

The beams can be used to bar the double doors from the inside—a defensive measure in case the asteroid is attacked by spacefaring creatures. Each beam is 8 feet long and weighs 250 pounds. Once the double doors are barred shut, only a siege engine or a creature that has the Siege Monster trait can force them open.

#### 19b. Cold Storage

This area extends under area 18b, as indicated on the map. A magic ward keeps the temperature in this area at 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Characters who stay in this area for more than 1 hour suffer the effects of extreme cold (see "chapter 5" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

The githyanki keep twelve crates here, filled with fresh produce and meat and stacked in two rows of six. Each crate is 2 feet on a side and weighs 50 pounds.

The foodstuffs come from distant worlds and are unfamiliar to most of Toril's population. Labels written in Gith reveal some of the crates' more savory contents, such as infinity vine stalks, H'cathan doom radishes, aartuk tongues, giant [space hamster](/compendium/bestiary/beast/space-hamster-wdmm.md) hocks, dried mortiss meat, pickled jammer leeches, and puffer steaks.

### 20. Dock

This stone dock was carved out of the asteroid. Despite its incalculable age, it's sturdy and safe. Because the dock is built along the asteroid's gravity plane, creatures can stand on its underside as easily as atop it. The experience of standing on the topside or underside of the dock can be disorienting, however, what with the planet Toril looming large below the asteroid.

The air around the dock is no different from the air in the asteroid, and the temperature here is 70 degrees Fahrenheit. These things cease to be true when one leaves the asteroid's air envelope, where the inhospitable vacuum of space awaits.

#### Ashtyrranthor Attacks!

The [adult red dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-red-dragon.md) [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) patrols the outside of the asteroid, staying inside its air envelope. If the characters stay on the dock for more than 10 minutes or make any loud noise while in this area, [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) notices them and swoops in for the kill.

#### Ship Arrivals

Spacefaring vessels dock here to bring in supplies for the inhabitants of Stardock. There are no ships at the dock while the characters are on the asteroid.

If you want to expand the characters' adventures to their widest possible extent, a githyanki astral ship or a spelljamming vessel could arrive while the characters are exploring Stardock. Where such a ship would go next is up to you.

### 21. Warrior Quarters

Githyanki warriors live and train in this area.

#### 21a. Guard Post

A male [githyanki knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) named Raajna and his mount, a female [young red dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md) named Smoakcant, are on duty here. They keep the warriors in line and defend the nursery (area 16). If they are not alerted to the characters' approach, the two are talking in Draconic, discussing how to best torture new mind flayer prisoners. The githyanki and the dragon fight intruders to the death.

##### Treasure

Raajna's plate armor is set with six red spinels (100 gp each) and two peridots (500 gp each).

#### 21b. Warriors' Quarters

This area extends under area 22, as indicated on map 16. The rough-walled chamber contains the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Warriors**. Ten [githyanki warriors](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) (five females and five males) reside here. If they have not been alerted, half of the githyanki are asleep when the characters arrive. The others are playing Dragonchess and talking in their native language.
> 
> **Furnishings**. Fifteen wooden bunk beds are arranged in three rows of five in the narrower portion of the room. Six round tables, each encircled by five chairs, stand in the wider area.
> 
> **Secret Trapdoor**. A secret trapdoor in the 30-foot-high ceiling leads to area 22. The trapdoor is a 3-foot-square stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to lift.
^87e

The githyanki fight intruders until six or more of them fall. The remaining warriors then retreat to area 27. The githyanki knight and the red dragon in area 21a investigate any combat or other disturbance in this area.

##### Treasure

There are five Dragonchess sets here. Each set has transparent crystal pieces and is worth 250 gp.

### 22. Al'chaia's Quarters

[Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) commands the githyanki forces in the Crystal Labyrinth and Crèche K'liir. This room serves as her quarters. The chamber's contents are as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Al'chaia**. [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md), a [githyanki knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) with 140 hit points, stands at a 5-foot-diameter round table in the center of the room, poring over reports written in Gith that document recent clashes with the mind flayers on level 17.
> 
> **Dragon**. Zolcharrx, a female [young red dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md), is curled up in a corner of the room, watching [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) wearily.
> 
> **Furnishings**. A huge, well-carved canopy bed standing against one wall has a small, shiny, black metal chest next to it (see "Treasure" below). Mounted on other walls are thirteen stuffed mind flayer heads.
> 
> **Secret Trapdoor**. A secret trapdoor in the floor under the table opens into the ceiling of area 21b. The trapdoor is a 3-foot-square stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to lift.
^881

The characters can avoid a fight here if they quickly inform [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md), in Draconic or Gith, that Urlon (see area 10) wants her dead. [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) thanks them for the information. She then promises the characters safe passage back to and through the Crystal Labyrinth, provided they leave Crèche K'liir as soon as they complete "one small task" for her.

If the characters are reluctant to accept her terms, [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) offers them a [manual of gainful exercise](/compendium/items/manual-of-gainful-exercise.md) or a [tome of clear thought](/compendium/items/tome-of-clear-thought.md) if they can get more information out of her githzerai prisoner, Ezria. Specifically, she wants to know why he's in Undermountain and how many other githzerai are with him. A successful DC 19 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check reveals that [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) has no intention of upholding her end of any deal.

If the characters agree to question Ezria, [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) and Zolcharrx escort them to the prison (area 29b) to meet the prisoner. If the characters obtain the information [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) requested, she and Zolcharrx usher characters from the prison to area 20, where [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) pretends the books are located. She then shouts for [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) before she and Zolcharrx attack. [Ashtyrranthor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ashtyrranthor-wdmm.md) joins the fight 1d4 + 1 rounds later.

[Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) fights until reduced to 90 hit points or fewer, then flees. Zolcharrx, ever loyal, fights to the death to cover [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s escape.

Characters who understand the Gith language can translate the battle reports in [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s custody with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Doing so reveals how many githyanki are currently stationed on level 17 of Undermountain, as well as the names of the githyanki leaders on that level.

#### Treasure

[Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s plate armor is set with eight black jaspers (50 gp each), eight red tourmalines (100 gp each), and four topazes (500 gp each).

The chest is locked. [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) hides the key to the chest in the sphincter-like maw of the stuffed mind flayer head closest to the chest. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools picks the lock, and a successful DC 30 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check forces the chest open. A [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic also opens it. The chest is a Small object with AC 19, 22 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It contains 900 gp, a [manual of gainful exercise](/compendium/items/manual-of-gainful-exercise.md), a [tome of clear thought](/compendium/items/tome-of-clear-thought.md), and a _Stardock rod_ (see "Stardock Rods").

### 23. Observation Room

This unoccupied room has four 2-foot-long, 6-inch-wide window slits that reveal starry space beyond. The githyanki observe incoming vessels from here.

A secret trapdoor in the floor opens into the ceiling of area 24. From here, it's a 30-foot drop to the floor of that chamber. The trapdoor is a 3-foot-square stone slab that can be lifted with a singular or combined Strength of 15 or higher.

### 24. Knights' Quarters

This area extends under area 23, as indicated on map 16. This chamber contains the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Knights**. Two male [githyanki knights](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) named Kr'rison and Vlaadric are engaged in an argument that's on the verge of coming to blows.
> 
> **Beds**. Four stone-framed beds line the south wall.
> 
> **Secret Trapdoor**. A secret trapdoor in the 30-foot-high ceiling leads to area 23. The trapdoor is a 3-foot-square stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to lift.
^885

If the characters get close to this area without alerting the githyanki, they hear the two arguing in Gith about which one of them deserves "[Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s magic books." If attacked, Kr'rison and Vlaadric fight together until one falls. The other then retreats to area 27.

#### Treasure

Kr'rison's plate armor is set with six red-brown carnelians (50 gp each) and four ambers (100 gp each). Vlaadric's plate armor is set with eight chalcedonies (50 gp each) and two aquamarines (500 gp each).

### 25. Memorial Hall

The names of githyanki who died hunting illithids on Toril are carved in neat rows on the walls of this chamber. The longest wall is dominated by a relief carving of a githyanki soldier battling three mind flayers.

### 26. Kitchen

The characters hear a lot of clatter as they approach this area, which extends under area 15a (as indicated on map 16). The kitchen contains the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Cooks**. Four [githyanki warriors](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) (two females and two males) prepare a large meal, moving between a pair of roaring iron stoves and a 10-foot-long table covered with pots, bowls, and cutlery.
> 
> **Shelves**. Shelves carved into the walls hold jars of spices and various other cooking ingredients.
^889

The warriors attack intruders on sight. Combat here brings reinforcements from area 27.

The stoves are piping hot. Any creature that touches a stove for the first time on a turn takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.

### 27. Mess Hall

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Furnishings**. Six 10-foot-long tables, each set with eight chairs, stand in neat rows.
> 
> **Githyanki**. Unless they have been drawn elsewhere, five [githyanki warriors](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) (three females and two males) and one male [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A) are eating together at a table, talking in low, angry tones.
^88b

If the characters get close to this area without alerting its occupants, they hear the githyanki complaining in Gith about [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s cruelty. The githyanki attack at once in response to any threat, fighting until four or more of them fall. Survivors then flee to area 30 without going through area 29.

### 28. Armory

The githyanki repair and store weapons and armor here.

#### 28a. Armor Storage

Ten suits of plate armor and thirty suits of half plate hang on wooden stands throughout the room. The armor is crafted in the baroque style favored by the githyanki, and the suits of plate armor have empty sockets and fittings where gemstones are meant to be set (though none are present in the suits displayed here).

#### 28b. Smithy and Weapon Storage

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Githyanki**. A female [githyanki warrior](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) named Salarrl is busy repairing armor at a forge. A wooden trestle table and an iron anvil are arranged nearby.
> 
> **Weapons**. Thirty greatswords hang on weapon racks mounted to the walls.
^88f

Salarrl is engrossed in her work. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check can sneak by her unnoticed. If she detects intruders, Salarrl retreats to area 30.

### 29. Prison

Enemies of the githyanki are imprisoned in this area, which consists of three large cells (areas 29a, 29b, and 29c) and a guard post (area 29d). A separate and permanent antimagic field fills the interior of each cell.

The doors to the cells, which stand outside the range of the antimagic fields, are magically locked. Any creature that carries a _Stardock rod_ (see "Stardock Rods") can open a cell door, which has no physical locks to be picked. A door can also be opened by a [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic cast outside the cells.

The guards in area 29d know when one of the cell doors is opened and investigate.

#### 29a. Empty Cell

The walls of this cell are covered in crudely etched graffiti dating back to a time before the githyanki took over Stardock.

#### 29b. Ezria's Cell

Ezria, a [githzerai zerth](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githzerai-zerth.md) with 32 hit points remaining, is imprisoned here. He lost his left eye years ago in a brawl with a blue slaad. An eye patch covers the loss but does little to hide the nasty scar across his face. He owes his fresh bruises to his githyanki hosts.

Ezria is normally calm and collected. That changes if the characters are accompanied by one or more mind flayers, whereupon Ezria loses his composure and tries to kill the illithids with his bare hands. He doesn't trust anyone who would ally with such creatures.

Ezria was caught spying on the githyanki in the Crystal Labyrinth. They have been torturing him for information, hoping to learn how many other githzerai are nearby. Ezria's will is nigh unbreakable, and he has answered none of the githyanki's questions. Ezria is not of a mind to share this information with the characters, either—at least not until they earn his trust by seeing him safely back to his friends on level 15.

If the characters profess to be enemies of the mind flayers, Ezria tells them that a mind flayer colony has formed in Seadeeps (level 17), and the githyanki are waging war against them. He will gladly accompany the characters if their intention is to wipe out the illithid colony. (As a party member, he's entitled to a full share of XP for defeating monsters.) At the very least, if the characters help Ezria escape, he asks to stay with them until they return to the Crystal Labyrinth. He then departs to rejoin his friends on level 15.

#### 29c. Imprisoned Illithids

Tel'zact and Yeluit, two [mind flayers](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) from Seadeeps (level 17), are held captive here. [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) is keeping them alive until they can be pitted against her finest githyanki knights in a display of battle prowess for the benefit of the young warriors in training.

If the characters try to engage with Tel'zact and Yeluit, the mind flayers propose a deal. With the aid of their [detect thoughts](/compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spells, the illithids have learned that [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) keeps a [manual of gainful exercise](/compendium/items/manual-of-gainful-exercise.md) and a [tome of clear thought](/compendium/items/tome-of-clear-thought.md) in her quarters. If the characters help the mind flayers escape, the illithids help them search for [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md)'s quarters (area 22) and claim the books. If an opportunity arises to turn against the characters for personal gain, the freed illithids take advantage of it.

#### 29d. Guard Room

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Gish**. Two female [githyanki gish](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-gish-mpmm.md) (see appendix A) named Aruut and Yangol stand in the middle of this unfurnished room, speaking to each other in low tones as they watch the cell doors.
> 
> **Green Crystals**. A glowing green crystal is embedded above each cell door.
^895

Characters who get close to the githyanki without alerting them overhear them talking (in Gith) about the mind flayer prisoners in area 29c. Aruut and Yangol are looking forward to the prisoners' executions. If a fight breaks out here, the githyanki in area 30 investigate.

A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of divination magic around each green crystal. Whenever a cell door is opened, the crystal above the doorway to that cell goes dark until the door closes. This is true regardless of which of a cell's two doors is opened. When Aruut and Yangol see a crystal go dark, they enter the cell to make sure nothing is amiss.

##### Treasure

Each githyanki gish carries a _Stardock rod_ (see "Stardock Rods").

### 30. Warrior Training

This area extends under area 31, as indicated on map 16. Characters who listen at a door to this room before entering hear a female voice barking commands in Gith and the sound of warriors in training. The chamber contains the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Githyanki**. A female [githyanki knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) named Saziq leads six [githyanki warriors](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) (three females and three males) in weapon drills.
> 
> **Training Equipment**. Thirty straw dummies shaped like illithids are arranged throughout the cavern. Racks of ropes and weights line the walls.
> 
> **Secret Trapdoor**. A secret trapdoor in the 30-foot-high ceiling leads to area 31. The trapdoor is a 3-foot-square stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to push open.
^898

If combat breaks out here, the githyanki gish in area 29d come to investigate. The githyanki attack anyone they perceive as an intruder and fight until five of their number fall, after which the rest retreat to area 21b.

The straw dummies are used for combat practice. Each is a Medium object with AC 10, 10 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.

#### Treasure

Saziq's plate armor is set with eight red-brown carnelians (50 gp each) and four deep green spinels (100 gp each). She also wears a plumed helm encrusted with eight citrines (50 gp each).

### 31. Observation Room

This room is devoid of furnishings and occupants. Four 2-foot-long, 6-inch-wide window slits look out toward the starry void of space.

A secret trapdoor in the floor opens into the ceiling of area 30. The trapdoor is a 3-foot-square stone slab that requires a successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to lift.

### 32. Graduation Chamber

Githyanki who attain the rank of warrior by hunting down and killing their first mind flayer are celebrated here. This cavern is also used for demonstrations of githyanki battle prowess, during which prisoners are executed by githyanki knights while young warriors cheer.

This cavern has the following features:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Scrying Eye**. When the characters enter this area for the first time, they see one of Halaster's scrying eyes floating in the middle of the cavern (see "Halaster's Lair"). It studies the characters for a minute or two before disappearing.
> 
> **Blood**. The floor is stained with pools of dry blood.
> 
> **Altar**. An 8-foot-high, rune-etched stone altar is situated in an alcove. It's topped with a life-size statue of a dagger-wielding githyanki warrior slaying a mind flayer.
^89c

The engravings on the altar, written in Gith, tell the story of how the githyanki freed themselves from the yoke of their illithid masters, shattered the mind flayer empires across the multiverse, and carved out their own kingdom on the Astral Plane under the rulership of Vlaakith the Lich-Queen. The altar conveniently omits any mention of the githzerai, but specific mention is made of Gith, the githyanki champion who led her people to freedom, and the sacrifices she made to ensure the future of her people. The statue atop the altar depicts Gith slaying an illithid oppressor to win her own freedom.

## Aftermath

If the party defeats [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) and leaves Urlon in charge, the Crystal Labyrinth and Stardock remain largely unchanged in the short term. Fearing that his betrayal of [Al'chaia](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alchaia-wdmm.md) might become known, Urlon orders his warriors to kill the characters if they ever cross paths with the githyanki again.

If the characters wipe out the githyanki and the red dragons, the mind flayers from level 17 are quick to take over the Crystal Labyrinth. If they acquire a _Stardock rod_, the illithids conquer the asteroid as well, hoping to commandeer the next astral vessel or spelljammer ship that comes to Stardock and invade new worlds.

The characters can secure Stardock as a base once the githyanki, dragons, and mind flayers are no longer threats. The asteroid is a quiet place most of the time, far removed from the perils and politics of Toril. The peace is interrupted every month or so by the arrival of a spelljamming vessel bearing provisions gathered from far-flung worlds. Such a vessel might be crewed by githyanki, gnomes, or some other spacefaring race.

About once a year, a githyanki-crewed astral ship delivers young githyanki to the crèche. A githyanki astral ship doesn't travel through space but rather shifts in and out of the Astral Plane, appearing literally out of nowhere next to the asteroid's dock and disappearing back into the silvery void once its delivery is complete. If the githyanki discover that Crèche K'liir has fallen, they retreat to the Astral Plane and return in short order with an overwhelming force to recapture the asteroid.

Halaster cares more about the Crystal Labyrinth than he does about Stardock. Suddenly unhappy with the "renovations" the githyanki have made, the Mad Mage might assert his control over the labyrinth and reshape it to suit his whims.
