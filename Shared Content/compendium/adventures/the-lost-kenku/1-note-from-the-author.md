# Note from the Author
*Source: The Lost Kenku, p. 2* 

to say this is a loosely constructed adventure may be an exaggeration of some degree. However, some patron saint of children requested a pdf of my adventure notes. So, here we are. I've use one version or another of this adventure to introduce people to the D&D experience as it has all the elements of a good game with very little ramp up time needed. The adventure structure is created in such a way to allow for as much or as little combat is desired. Encounters can be changed to suit a lvl1 campaign, and with a little imagination I imagine one could have fun altering it for a party in the high teens. Some nice paintings of Ancient Dragons and Neoliths may be in order.

Have fun with it. Change, add, or remove monsters, items, and characters as you see fit.

A special thanks to the wonderful donors of the Extra Life Charity and the Dungeons and Dragons Team. Together we can manage to do a little bit of good in this mind-flayer-run world.

## Wizard of Weirding

### Mind Flayer Alhoon

The Wizard Weirding is a mind flayer alhoon in disguise. It uses disguise self to appear as a male human wizard named Weirding. Long ago, it left the hive in search of power and immortality through magic. To blend in with the general population of Faerun, the alhoon married a human woman and adopted her child as his own. Over time, the alhoon was discovered by his wife, and was forced to eat her brain. Currently the alhoon runs the outpost of Weirding where he mines the local mountains for minerals to fund his research. The Wizard Weirding uses the people of Weirding as the subjects of his mind experiments.

The Wizard Weirding will attempt to capture new and interesting adventurers and either devour their brains, or preform experiments on them. If confronted violently the Wizard Weirding will attack the party and use the mind controlled population of the outpost to prevent anyone from escaping.

The [mind flayer alhoon](/compendium/bestiary/undead/alhoon-mpmm.md) stat block can be found in Volo's Guide to Monsters.

## Mez Kara

### Sun Elf Apprentice

Mez Kara is an elven [apprentice](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/apprentice-wizard-mpmm.md) to the Wizard Weirding. In reality, she is one of his mind controlled thralls. She doesn't know the wizard is an alhoon, but she knows he has granted her power.

She serves him willingly and is always looking for ways to please him. She will find powerful adventurers of great interest and convince them to stay at the manor house and meet the Wizard Weirding himself.

The apprentice stat block can be found in Volo's Guide to Monsters. Additionally, Mez Kara can cast friendship and charm person at Level 1.

## Gregor Forskog

### Thug and Bookie

Gregor is a miner and bookie. He and his gang take bets from the locals on just about everything. Currently, he is getting ready to make an example of Gnator Gnimmcap for not paying his debts by feeding Gnator's fingers to his lizard folk thug.

Gregor's gang consists of himself, a male lizard folk named Tooth, and a female goliath barbarian named Cat Keeper. Tooth can be distracted by tasty meats. Cat keeper has a weakness for cats. Otherwise they are brutes that will do anything Gregor asks of them. Gregor dreams of being part of a proper gang like the Zhentarim.

Use the [bandit captain](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) and [bandit](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) stats found in the Monster Manual for Gregor and his gang.

## Gnator Gnimmcap

### Grounds Keeper

Gnator Gnimmcap is the grounds keeper at the Weirding mansion. He has taken to drinking and gambling in order to escape the nightmares brought on by the experimentation of the Wizard Weirding. He has acquired a sizable debt to the bookie Gregor Forskog and is overdue in his payments.

Gantor Gnimmcap told Cawkrin Jones how to get into the mansion through the cellar in exchange for a 30 gold pieces (which he has now gambled away). In exchange for helping with his gambling debts, Gnator will gladly help adventurers, as long as it doesn't put him in danger.

## Tonk Hammertoes

### Bartender

Tonk Hammertoes is the bartender and owner of Bucket's Bottom. Tonk has been experimented on a little too much. He is short on words and intelligence. He will gladly serve ale, but getting useful information out of him is difficult. He has seen a Kenku, but when, where, and who the Kenku was exactly escapes his memory.

## Celest Weirding

### Daughter of the Wizard Weirding

Celest refuses to speak with her father and spends most of her time in her room crying. She is desperate to escape and will bargain with the players if she is convinced they will help her.

Celeste is the step daughter of the Wizard Weirding. She wants to leave the the manor and the village to explore the world on her own. Her dream is to visit the great city of Waterdeep with her boyfriend, Dicky Whit. Three nights ago Dicky helped her escape through her window, but they were caught by her father. She hasn't seen Dicky since and worries that her father has scared him off. She can't escape on her own due to the [kamadan](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/kamadan-toa.md)

roaming the grounds. Celest also sufferers from chronic headaches as a result of the experiments her father does on her. Celest is unaware of the experiments performed, but a perception DC 15 can see that celest wears a wig. If the wig is removed scars in an arcane pattern can be seen etched all over her scalp.

Unlike the many of his other experiments, wizard weirding has been trying to alter his daughters brain to become a powerful psionicist.

Celest can cast Mind Blast once a day.

## Cawkrin Jones

### The Lost Kenku

Cawkrin is currently trapped in an enchanted painting in the Wizard's Study. When he touched one of the Glass Cases, he was magically transported into the painting. Cawkrin is a Kenku and thief. If released, he will help the party in whatever way possible. He does not know Weirding's secret.

Use the [master thief](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/master-thief-mpmm.md) stat block from Volos Guide To Monsters for Cawkrin's stats.

## The Outpost of Weirding

Weirding is a small village outpost protected by tall 12' stone walls. The village consists of a small residential district, mining district, small commercial district, and the Manor of Weirding. Most of the population of Weirding has been subject to the Wizard's experimentation and will become thralls at his mental command. The signs of the experimentation can sometimes be seen ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception) DC 17 or higher) as small scars around the temples and scalp.

### Residential District

A handful of single family homes, small gardens, and small to medium sized livestock.

### Mining District

This area consists of mining barracks, equipment sheds, blacksmiths, and a large warehouse where minerals are stored.

Players will encounter miners coming and going from the mines.

#### What the Miners Know

Weirding pays well for six month contracts, after which they get to return to their homeland.

- The mountain behind the village is rich with gemstones and gold.
- There are occasional adventurers or traders that pass through.
- They have not seen a Kenku.
- Most recommend going to the tavern if the party wants to hear rumors.

Equipment such as rope, shovels, pickaxes, and torches may be found in the equipment sheds.

### Commercial District

Local trade is done in the commercial District. The largest building in the commercial district is the tavern inn, Bucket's Bottom. Other areas are a sundrie shop, general store, and butcher's shop.

#### Further Exploration

- **Sundrie Shop.** Balick's Goods run by Ballick the Gnome. Ballick sells various sundries and general goods. If asked, Balick will inform the party that a kenku came through five days ago and bought his entire stock of sunflower seeds. The party would know that Cawkrin Jones had a weakness for sunflower seeds.
- **Butcher Shop.** Nard's Meat Shop, ran by Nard, a female human, who sells various meats. Most meats are from various dinosaurs. A kenku came through five days ago and bought three raw dino-steaks. (Cawkrin later used the stakes to distract the Kamadan patrolling the Manor lawn.)
- **Tavern.** The Bucket's Bottom is always busy, no matter the time of day. The large tavern is filled with locals relaxing and working off steam from a long day (or nights) at the mine. There is also a small boxing/wrestling ring in the tavern where the locals gamble on fights between boxers. While there are plenty of characters about, a few jump out to the party:  
      
    - **Mez Kara.** drinking wine at a quiet corner table. Silently watching the patrons of the tavern.  
    - **Gnator Gnimmcap.** looking worried and anxious as the fight he is gambeling on seems not be going his way.  
    - **Gregor Forskog.** and his thugs are taking bets and collecting debts among the crowd around the fighting ring. Very soon he will confront Gnator about paying his debts.  
    - **Tonk Hammertoes,.** strange and oddly distant, quietly tends bar.

## Manor Of Weirding

The Manor of Weirding is a large, three story stone manor located on a hill near the back of the village. A stone wall 10 feet in height surrounds the Manor. A large iron gate acts as the only access through the wall. It is guarded by four humanoid guards. The stone walls are covered in vines that have bright yellow blossoms that glow in the dark.

### The Vines

The vines have thorns and are poisonous. If pricked, an adventurer will take 1d4 poison damage. A character can scale the wall and avoid the vines if they make a Dexterity check of DC15.

### The Gate

The Large Iron gate is closed. It is guarded by four Guards that will refuse entry unless escorted by the apprentice Mez or the grounds keeper Gnator Gnimmcap. Use the Guard Stat Block in the Monster Manual.

### The Yard

A small yard consisting of dirt, grass, and the occasion flower seperates the main manor house from the sturrounding wall. Three trained Kamadan roam the yard, guarding against intruders. Use Kamadan stat block in Tomb of Annihilation.

### Entrances into the Manor

The the main entrance to the mannor are a large set of double doors made of solid wood. They are shut and locked in the evening and night. The door can be broken open with a Strength check of DC 18. The lock can be picked with a [Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand) check of DC 17. Entry through the Front Doors leads to the Foyer.

The cellar doors are located at the rear of the Manor, and lead to the cellar below the manor. A strength check of DC 16 can break them open. [Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand) DC 13 check will pick the lock. The cellar doors lead to the Cellar.

Windows to various rooms can be seen on the mansion. Most of them are protected with iron grates. The Iron grates are attached directly into the iron window frame and cannot be opened or removed without the use of force (or a hack saw). A DC 24 Strength check is required to remove the iron window grates. One window's iron grates are bent open, leading to Celest Weirding's Room.

Doors line the Gallery hall leading to the Wizard's Study Lab, Celest's Room, Weirding's Room, and Wizard's Study Library.

#### Wizard's Study Lab

Each body's head has a small round hole located at the top of the skull. Bodies include: a bug bear, a goblin, a male human, and a mind flayer. The male human is still dripping blood. A shelf filled with organs in jars. One of the shelves is a fomorian eye that will curse anyone it sees with the "Evil Eye" (the description of the Evil Eye can be found in the [fomorian](/compendium/bestiary/giant/fomorian.md) entry in the Monster Manual).

The doorway to the room is magical. Any item taken through the door way will trigger the spell [Alarm](/compendium/spells/alarm.md).

The glass cases can be opened by picking the locks (DC 15) or breaking the glass. If the lock pick fails or the glass is touched by anyone but the Wizard Weirding, the player attempting to open the case will be magically teleported into the painting in the room and appear next to the kenku, Cawkrin Jones.

#### Items of Interest

- The painting is a magical prison triggered by anyone trying to break into the glass cases. The painting can be disenchanted or disabled by destroying the frame of the painting.

- The Book: Brain Dead, a Psionic's Guide to Necromancy can be found in one of the locked Glass Cases.
- A Deck of Many Things can be found in one of the locked glass cases (see "Deck of Many Things", page 162 of the Dungeon Masters Guide)
- A Scroll of Fireball can be found in one of the locked glass cases.
- A Potion of Greater Healing can be found in one of the locked glass cases.

### Cellar

A large stone-lined cellar spans the manor. Inside the cellar are rows of wine racks. Near the back of the cellar are iron cages, all empty save one which contains a kobold named Quinn Quinn.

The walls of the cellar look different than that of the manor. Some still have old hieroglyphs depicting chultan dwarves. A history check of DC 14 will reveal that the manor was built on a much older foundation. Along one of the walls there is wine rack that is out of line with the rest in the cellar. Pushing it aside reveals a secret passage that leads outside, opening behind the Bucket's Bottom.

Mez Kara may also be in the cellar preparing to bring up Quinn Quinn for experimentation.

### Encounters of Manor Weirding

The players may run into one of the servants of the Manor Weirding during any exploration. The servants all suffer one form of disability or another from the wizard's overzealous experimentation. Examples include: constantly drooling, seeming half asleep, zombie-like behavior, high paranoia, and the inability to control the volume of their voice.

Celeste can only be encountered in her room, but may choose to follow the party in order to escape. The Wizard Weirding does not sleep or eat (anything but brains) and often wanders the mansion. If the players see him and the Wizard is unaware of their presence, he will be levitating in the manner of a mind flayer rather than walking. If an alarm of any kind is raised, the Wizard will show up.

#### Nut Puncher Quinn Quinn

[Kobold](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) who specializes in punching folks in the nuts. He is covered in dragon feces. If released from his iron cage Quinn Quinn will attempt to punch any male in the gonads while screaming, "I'm Nut Puncher Quinn Quinn!" and then run away.
