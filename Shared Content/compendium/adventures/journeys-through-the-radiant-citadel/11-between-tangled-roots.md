_An Adventure for 10th-Level Characters_

When a legendary dragon known as a [bakunawa](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/bakunawa-jttrc.md) appears and attacks a town that has long revered its kind, the characters are called upon to learn why it has gone on a rampage. They must track down the bakunawa and discover the reason for its ire before dragon hunters slay the sacred creature.

## Background

The bakunawa known as Pangil ng Buwan has long dwelled on the dangerous island of Lambakluha, once the holiest site on the Dayawlongon archipelago. Its dwelling lies before the great tree-temple called Bathalang Puno, a massive, mighty, sacred tree that was long ago burned by invaders. In the years that followed the tree's desecration, evil spirits infested the island. These foul spirits caused unnatural growths to manifest—spirit blisters that corrupt the land and its creatures. Gradually, this sickness encroached on Pangil ng Buwan's lair. While the ancient bakunawa slept, strangling roots enveloped it and poured poison into its being for centuries.

When Pangil ng Buwan awoke not long ago, its corruption caused it to hate all it once loved. After raging across Lambakluha, it sought its ancient spirit companion, [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md). But its one-time feelings of companionship has turned to rage, and it wreaks vast destruction in its search.

### Setting the Adventure

This adventure and the islands of the Dayawlongon archipelago can appear in any setting. The following are suggestions for contextualizing the adventure in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters traveling from the Radiant Citadel arrive in Dayawlongon near the town of Kalapang. While this adventure visits just two of the local islands, the "Dayawlongon Gazetteer" section provides context for further adventures you might have in the region.
- **Eberron.** The eastern coast of Sarlona or the seas around Aerenal could incorporate the Dayawlongon archipelago, or the islands could be in a new chain convenient to your other adventures.
- **Forgotten Realms.** Various islands in the Sea of Swords, such as those off the coast of Tethyr, could host the adventure's locations. The Dayawlongon archipelago could also be in the Sea of Fallen Stars, the Shining Sea, or elsewhere.

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure:

- **Call of the Storyteller.** Via a mutual connection, the characters receive a plea to come to Kalapang from a binukot, a regional bard who serves as a repository of Dayawlongon's history. This performer, [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md), seeks the help of experienced adventurers for a delicate mission with a handsome reward.
- **Monster Hunt.** The characters hear rumors of a monster rampaging across the Dayawlongon archipelago. But soon after they arrive in the region, they receive word that the binukot [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) seeks a word with them, as not all is what it seems.
- **Rare Sighting.** A scholar friend of the characters has heard that a bakunawa, an exceptionally rare type of dragon, has appeared on the Dayawlongon archipelago. They entreat the characters to go and fetch a scale from the creature. To start the characters' quest, the scholar points them toward a local expert, [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md), in the town of Kalapang.

## Starting the Adventure

The adventure begins as the characters approach Kalapang. As they draw near, they witness a calamity. Read or paraphrase the following text to set the scene:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The trip to Kalapang has been uneventful, with travelers and trade wagons regularly passing. Soon the pale, vine-covered wall surrounding the town appears in the distance.
> 
> Suddenly, from the clear sky crackles a bolt of lightning followed by a thunderous screech. Above the town circles a mighty draconic form—an iridescent creature wreathed in lightning and with multiple sets of wings. As smoke begins to rise from Kalapang, the creature dives toward the town.
^2ec

The characters are still a mile from Kalapang when Pangil ng Buwan—a [bakunawa](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/bakunawa-jttrc.md) (see the end of this adventure)—attacks. The attack is swift; the creature strafes the town, vanishes among the buildings for an instant, then soars away to the northwest. No matter what methods the characters use to reach Kalapang, the bakunawa has already departed by the time they reach town.

As the characters near Kalapang, they see people fetching water to put out fires and others tending to the wounded and scared. A character who asks these people what happened learns the following:

- A bakunawa came out of nowhere and attacked. Its lightning breath and brief rampage caused terror, fires, and ruin.
- A bakunawa is a kind of dragon said to hold power over the seas and skies.
- Dayawlongon was once protected by gigantic bakunawa, but they vanished long ago. Their smaller descendants are rare.
- Bakunawa are sacred in the region, though dragon hunters pursue rumors of them, hoping to sell their body parts for gold or as sacred relics.

Characters who help the locals are thanked, but the locals largely have the situation under control. The characters are allowed to enter the walled town unimpeded.

### Destruction in Kalapang

As the characters enter Kalapang, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The streets of Kalapang are filled with rushing people, some trying to douse smoldering rooftops, others tending to the wounded or to crying youngsters. Nearby, a row of homes lies in rubble. Iridescent blue scales are scattered amid the debris.
> 
> A woman wearing a teal dress embroidered with golden constellations surveys the destruction. She waves in your direction, then approaches. "You arrived at a difficult time. I'd hoped to prevent exactly this," she says, gesturing at the fallen building. "I am [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md). Thank you for answering my call." The woman pauses, looking around at the chaos, before addressing you again. "Follow me. I know a place where we won't have to worry about others overhearing—and there's someone I need you to meet."
^2ee

Before the characters can go with [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md), the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score notices something moving amid the debris. A character who investigates realizes someone's trapped in the rubble. Clearing the rubble safely requires a character to make a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a failed check, they find one of the home's residents (a [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) with 0 hit points. On a successful check, they find the resident coughing but largely unharmed. Whether found conscious or restored by healing, the resident thanks the characters. The resident can't reward the characters but speaks well of them to the whole neighborhood—a development that impresses [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md).

### The Spirit and the Storyteller

Following the rescue, [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) asks the characters to follow her to a quiet, nearby courtyard shaded by an ancient salingbobog tree. When the group arrives, a figure steps from the base of the tree. This is [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md), a ninuno and [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md)'s partner. Light clothing of leaves and vines grows from [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md)'s body, and when [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) speaks, their voice sounds like rustling leaves. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) or Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check knows that a ninuno is a spirit of the land, similar to a dryad, who serves as an intermediary between the living and the gods. [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) or [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) shares these details if asked, along with any specifics from the "Life in Dayawlongon" section later in this adventure.

#### Nimuel

[Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) (neutral good, human [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) is a binukot in Kalapang, a scholar who collects and orally shares the region's wisdom, laws, traditions, culture, songs, poetry, literature, and more. Though young, she is so distinguished that many come to her for guidance and for stewarding their own stories.

##### Personality Trait

"I seek to honor the gods with every song I sing and every word I speak."

##### Ideal

"The history of our land is rich with wonders and missteps. By sharing these truths, I can help create a greater future."

##### Bond

"My tie to [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) is special and brings me closer to the divine."

##### Flaw

"I would never question the will of the gods or their servants."

#### Lungtian

The ninuno [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) (chaotic good [dryad](/compendium/bestiary/fey/dryad.md)) was once a human and one of the first binukots of Kalapang. In this earlier life, they fought to defend the land from invaders alongside Pangil ng Buwan and formed a deep friendship with the bakunawa. When [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) died, the gods brought their spirit back as a dryad-like ninuno.

##### Personality Trait

"I am devoted to whoever protects the land and its people."

##### Ideal

"The land and its ways must be defended, most of all those ancient beings—like bakunawa—who created all that exists today."

##### Bond

"My love for [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) makes me feel like my old self."

##### Flaw

"I compare all mortals I meet to the heroes I've known throughout my long life."

#### The Bakunawa's Wrath

[Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) introduces [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md), then moves on to explain that the message she sent the characters arose from the ninuno's concern. The two share the following information:

- The bakunawa that attacked Kalapang is named Pangil ng Buwan, and it is one of the oldest of its kind. It fought against foreign invaders long ago and has never been hostile toward the land's people.
- Pangil ng Buwan was a friend to [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md), but the bakunawa disappeared more than two hundred years ago.
- A few weeks ago, [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) began having visions of corruption centered on the island of Lambakluha, once a holy place and now a ruined land. Pangil ng Buwan appeared in these visions, leaving [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) to believe the bakunawa still lives.
- [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) and [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) ask the characters to seek out Pangil ng Buwan, discover what's happened to it, and bring it peace.
- [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) offers the characters 600 gp apiece as a reward, while [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) promises them a divine blessing (see "Ninuno's Mark" in the adventure's conclusion).

Additionally, [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) and [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) can share any information from the "Dayawlongon Gazetteer" section later in this adventure. Before the conversation ends, [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) shares one more important piece of information:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "During the attack, I could feel Pangil ng Buwan," [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) whispers. "There was a shadow in its spirit. Something poisonous and pulsing, a sickness I don't know. The bakunawa seemed to be fighting with itself. I believe that's why we've seen many injured but no dead among the rubble."
> 
> [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) glances toward the street, still packed with wounded and scared people, then continues. "I want you to know and understand this—after today, I don't expect many to have the ears to hear such things."
^2fb

#### Mission to Lambakluha

If the characters agree to [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) and [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md)'s terms, [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) tells the characters that Pangil ng Buwan's home was once the island of Lambakluha. The pair originally wanted the characters to journey to the island and discover the source of [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md)'s visions along with any signs of Pangil ng Buwan. Now, this mission is even more urgent—the bakunawa must be found and calmed.

A sea voyage to Lambakluha would be perilous due to the raging whirlpools that separate the archipelago's islands, but the characters can reach Lambakluha in an easy two-day journey by traversing Flames Everlasting, one of the skybridges that connect the islands. This skybridge stretches from the island of Malabulak to Lambakluha, where Pangil ng Buwan once made its home in Bathalang Puno, a massive holy tree killed long ago. The island is largely deserted, but at the end of Flames Everlasting is a camp called the Final Steps of Courage, home to soldiers and scholars seeking to fight back the dangers infesting the island.

### Preparations in Kalapang

Although [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) and [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) encourage the characters to depart for Lambakluha as swiftly as possible, the party can rest and resupply in Kalapang as long as the characters need. Pangil ng Buwan doesn't threaten the town again during this time.

Characters who explore the town find the people hospitable but distracted, fearing that the bakunawa might return at any moment. Most shops are closed, but the characters can find shops selling "any item" from the "Player's Handbook". A local inn called the Root and Roost offers rooms for 1 gp a night. The price normally includes a hot meal, but with everything going on, the kitchen offers only a cold meal of mangoes and shrimp paste.

## Traveling the Skybridge

Journeying from Kalapang to the foot of the Flames Everlasting Skybridge takes only a few hours. Travel is quick along the main roads, and word of the attack on Kalapang has spread to the few travelers the party meets. Most people are headed away from Kalapang, believing the bakunawa will return.

As the characters near the skybridge, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A magnificent bridge arcs into the air, stretching high above the trees and over the sea beyond. The span soars without supports, its path bending in serpentine curves that stretch into the distance. The bridge is over a hundred feet wide, and statues of stern, draconic creatures adorn it.
^2ff

Flames Everlasting is typical of the skybridges that connect the islands of the Dayawlongon archipelago, though it's used less than the others. These legendary structures were created by draconic magic in the distant past and still feature prominently in local legends. Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check know the details about skybridges from the "Noteworthy Sites" section at the end of this adventure. Any travelers the characters pass are also happy to share these details.

### Dragon Hunters

As the characters approach the foot of the skybridge, they find a group of five locals with horses resting and sharing a meal at the roadside. The five are well armed and look like hunters or adventurers. If the characters approach openly, the group's leader waves them over. When the characters are within earshot, the leader introduces himself as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Hail travelers! I'm [Paolo Maykapal](/compendium/bestiary/npc/paolo-maykapal-jttrc.md), and judging by your road, I guess that you've come from Kalapang. Tell me, were you there during the attack? Are the rumors true? If Pangil ng Buwan has returned, I swear by all my ancestors that the monster will die by my hand."
^301

Paolo is the group's leader, and he travels with four of his cousins: Dolores, Raqua, Senedicto, and Yomas. They were raised together and share Paolo's conviction that they must slay the bakunawa as vengeance for wrongs done to their clan. All five [dragon hunters](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-hunter-jttrc.md) are lawful neutral humans. They use the [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) stat block with the following adjustments:

- They wear [studded leather armor](/compendium/items/studded-leather-armor.md) that gives them AC 13.
- Replace the Heavy Crossbow action with the action below.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, ranged 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.
^302

#### Paolo Maykapal

One of the city of Laguna's finest heroes, [Paolo Maykapal](/compendium/bestiary/npc/paolo-maykapal-jttrc.md) has trained his entire life to kill bakunawa. He is warm and friendly but is uncompromising when it comes to carrying out his work. Now that Pangil ng Buwan has returned, his duty to the memory of his clan's founder and ancestors is clear. He's willing to engage in underhanded behavior to ensure he and his team succeed.

##### Personality Trait

"Everything I do and say has a purpose. I've no time for frivolities."

##### Ideal

"I want to be a living example of a true Dayawlongo: one who gives everything for family and country."

##### Bond

"What I want matters less than what is good for my home."

##### Flaw

"I will use anyone who isn't part of my family as a means to an end."

#### The Dragon Hunters' Offer

Paolo and his group listen intently to anything the characters share and ask them about the bakunawa, what it looked like, and how it behaved. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check can tell Paolo is trying to learn all he can about the bakunawa but is less concerned about Kalapang or its people.

If the characters don't share details of their experience with Paolo, he still recognizes them as adventurers and asks them to join his group as they head to Lambakluha to slay Pangil ng Buwan.

Even if the characters don't join the dragon hunters, Paolo eagerly discusses any of the following points:

- Pangil ng Buwan was seen flying away to the southwest. Paolo and his group plan to follow via the skybridge.
- Paolo and his cousins hate Pangil ng Buwan due to the Maykapal Clan's blood feud with the bakunawa. During the region's last revolution against foreign aggression two hundred years ago, Pangil ng Buwan abandoned the defense of the city of Laguna. This resulted in the death of Urian, the founder of Laguna and the Maykapal Clan.
- Generations of Laguna hunters have grown up on stories of Pangil ng Buwan's betrayal. When Paolo heard word of a bakunawa seen in the skies over Dayawlongon, he began to seek the creature so he can settle his clan's blood feud.
- Paolo is also certain he and his group can make a profit from selling pieces of the bakunawa's corpse and would split the profits with the characters.

To anyone who speaks out against hunting the bakunawa, Paolo laughs and says:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Yes, yes. I hear those who speak of the monsters as though they're gods. But Pangil ng Buwan is a god who left my people, my city, the founder of my clan to die. Surely you understand my position?"
^30a

Nothing any character can say deters Paolo or his allies from their quest. If the characters decide to work with Paolo's group, the two groups travel to Lambakluha together. If the party chooses not to accompany Paolo and his group, Paolo politely wishes them safe travels but says nothing more of the dragon hunters' plans. His group then hangs back. They ultimately use [necklaces of prayer beads](/compendium/items/necklace-of-prayer-beads.md) from a bonesinger (see the following section) that they had previously aided to [wind walk](/compendium/spells/wind-walk.md) to Lambakluha and reach Bathalang Puno about the same time as the characters.

### Traveling the Skybridge

The journey across the Flames Everlasting Skybridge takes 36 hours, with the incredible bridge soaring 600 feet or more over forests, steep hills, and the sea. Like all the skybridges between the Dayawlongon islands, this bridge is well-lit by gentle magical light at night. It once featured way stations, but few travel to Lambakluha anymore, so the way stations are abandoned, and the party encounters few people during their travels. As the characters make their way to Lambakluha, roll on the Skybridge Sights table after every 12 hours of travel—or whenever you see fit—to determine what encounters they have.

**Skybridge Sights**

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Bonesinger (see below) |
| 2 | A small storm reveals itself to be a violent group of three [air elementals](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md). |
| 3 | A dead wyvern lies on the skybridge, its body scorched by lightning. |
| 4 | A curious and friendly [cloud giant](/compendium/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md) is surprised to see travelers on the skybridge and asks them at length about recent happenings in the lands below. |
^skybridge-sights

#### Bonesinger

As the characters travel the skybridge, they might encounter a lone old woman crouching near one of the draconic statues adorning the bridge, singing to it in a gentle voice. This is Ina (neutral good, human [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md)), a skybridge tender known as a bonesinger. She tends the magic that supports and protects Flames Everlasting and honors the many gigantic, ancient bakunawa whose bones are infused into the bridge.

Ina greets the characters courteously and warns them of the dangers of Lambakluha. The bonesinger has not yet heard of the attack in Kalapang and is horrified if the characters share the news with her. If asked about recent bakunawa activity, Ina says she's heard a bakunawa's call over the skybridge in the night, but she has seen nothing.

After conversing with the characters, Ina returns to her ritual song and invites the characters to join in. Any character can sing with her, but those who do so and succeed on a DC 18 Charisma ([Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check impress the bonesinger. She thanks the first character to impress her by giving them her [necklace of prayer beads](/compendium/items/necklace-of-prayer-beads.md). The necklace's beads look like tiny fangs and include a bead of [wind walk](/compendium/spells/wind-walk.md) and 1d4 other magic beads.

#### Sighting Lambakluha

A few hours before the party reaches Lambakluha, the party spots their destination:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The mist on the horizon parts, revealing a gigantic tree thousands of feet tall, its highest branches hidden by clouds. The great tree's boughs are bent, barren, and lifeless.
^30e

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check knows this tree is Bathalang Puno, one of the holy trees of the Dayawlongon archipelago that was burned by invaders long ago. Soon after the characters sight the tree, the stench of ash permeates the air.

## Lambakluha

Once a verdant island with an expansive network of rivers and mangrove forests, Lambakluha is now a rank swamp. Tormented spirits haunt the island, especially its ruined communities, and their corruptive influence blights the surviving life. The island can be reached by two skybridges: Flames Everlasting, which the characters traveled, and Hope's Dagger, which leads to another island to the west.

Lambakluha is depicted on map 10.1.

### The Final Steps of Courage

As the characters pass the final bend of Flames Everlasting, read the following description of the skybridge's end:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The skybridge descends onto a sizable island overgrown with tangled swamp vegetation and covered in a haze tasting of ash. A few acres at the skybridge's end have been cleared and surrounded by a wooden palisade. Within, simple wooden buildings and dingy tents form an encampment.
^311

The camp is called the Final Steps of Courage, and beyond it spreads the blighted landscape of Lambakluha. The skybridge ends within the redoubt's wooden walls, which hold tents for a few dozen soldiers and scholars, as well as a mess hall and trading post. The camp's amenities are for those working there, but if the characters distinguish themselves as the soldiers' allies or succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check with mess hall or trading post staff, they can use the facilities, too.

Should the characters follow the skybridge into the camp, four sentries (use the [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) stat block) armed with crossbows stop them and question them about their origins, business, and destination.

#### Attack on the Final Steps

As the characters converse with the sentries, a horn sounds from the camp's south gate. The sentries run toward the opposite side of the camp while the camp staff scatter. If the characters follow the sound, they see several tortured-looking incorporeal Undead attacking the camp's south gate and soldiers making an organized defense. A moment later, whether the characters are near the gate or elsewhere, three [wraiths](/compendium/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) that look like the spirits of burn victims close in on the characters and attack.

#### What the Soldiers Know

If the characters defeat the wraiths, the camp's commander, Captain Atoy, thanks the characters and welcomes them to rest, eat, and resupply.

The soldiers and scholars of the camp are here in hopes of reclaiming Lambakluha and making it safe for resettlement. Their work is slow, as the tortured spirits of the land attack at random intervals. The soldiers are used to defending against spirits, but in recent weeks they've spotted flashes of blue lightning near Bathalang Puno, Pangil ng Buwan's storied lair.

If the characters explain to Captain Atoy or others in the camp that they're seeking Bathalang Puno and Pangil ng Buwan, the soldiers warn them of the danger, not just of the bakunawa but of the miles of swamp known as the Weeping Paths that the characters will have to traverse. If the characters ask anyone in the camp about what dangers they might face, the soldiers speak of Undead and of vicious vegetation.

##### Swapping Stories

The camp's inhabitants are starved for stories of the outside world. After the attack, several ask the characters to share a meal and tell them of their travels. If the characters agree, in the course of their discussions a soldier relates recent gossip about a scouting troop that returned from a ruin called Sorrow's Zenith and described strange vegetation that "breathed with hatred." No one in the camp knows more than this, as the scouts left the island weeks ago. However, the remaining troops can direct the characters to Sorrow's Zenith if the characters wish to investigate further.

### The Weeping Paths

When the characters leave the Final Steps of Courage for the Weeping Paths, read the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Beyond the camp, the ash-heavy air closes in. Decay and ruin are everywhere, from the murky water flowing through the endless swamp to the mildewed vines and the rotting roots of swollen mangrove and banyan trees.
^316

The Weeping Paths is a treacherous quagmire home to malicious spirits. The swamp and the overgrown hills beyond are "difficult terrain". At a normal pace, it takes the party a full day to reach Bathalang Puno (24 miles away), or half a day to reach Sorrow's Zenith (12 miles away) and then two thirds of a day to reach Bathalang Puno (9 miles away; see the "Player's Handbook" for "details on travel pace"). The entire region is also "lightly obscured" by foliage and haze, causing creatures to have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

Threats lurk amid the wilds. For every 3 miles the party travels, roll on the Weeping Paths Encounters table.

**Weeping Paths Encounters**

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1–3 | Miasma (see below) |
| 4–5 | A [wraith](/compendium/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) appears and attacks the party. It looks like one of the characters, albeit covered in terrible burns. |
| 6–7 | Three [shambling mounds](/compendium/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) emerge from a heap of rotting vegetation near a ruined statue and attack the party. |
| 8–9 | A fire-scarred [treant](/compendium/bestiary/plant/treant.md) awakens and attacks the characters, blaming them for the destruction of its home. |
| 10 | Voices of Flame (see below) |
^weeping-paths-encounters

#### Miasma

The haze surrounding the characters coalesces into a dense, gray miasma. A minute before this occurs, characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) or ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check notice the haze growing thicker and more pungent. If the characters notice, they can avoid the miasma by rushing out of the area. If they don't, a toxic, 20-foot-radius sphere surrounds a random character. Creatures in this sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. The miasma is stationary and dissipates 1 minute later.

Roll on the Weeping Paths Encounters table again for another encounter that occurs soon after, rerolling another miasma encounter.

#### Voices of Flame

Dozens of gray, spectral figures appear in the haze around the party and move along with them. The forms can't be harmed or warded away by any means. Soon after the shapes appear, the figures begin speaking as one, telling the grim fates of those who perished during the razing of Bathalang Puno. The figures relate terrible ends like burning alive in their homes or being crushed by massive, falling tree limbs. After the recitation of each grim fate, one of the forms bursts into flames and vanishes. After a minute, a voice from the haze asks each character, "Tell us. How did you die?" Characters who respond with a tragic tale, even a fictitious one, are unharmed. Characters who don't must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or burst into flames and take 35 (10d6) points of fire damage.

### Sorrow's Zenith

Out of the way from the path to Bathalang Puno is a ruined temple called Sorrow's Zenith. If the characters visit the site, they notice an unusual growth covering a weathered statue. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An ancient statue of a bakunawa is cracked with age and covered with unusual vines. Amid a cluster of tangled roots, a blister-like growth heaves like a breathing thing and glows with a sickly light.
^31a

A character who studies the blister and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check realizes that the movement within the mass is the shifting of tiny, ghostly figures. A character who has proficiency in the [Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature) skill recognizes that these vines and the blister are unnatural. With a successful DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check made to examine the blister, a character determines the vines are drawing spiritual energy from the land and concentrating that energy within the blister. However, the nature and purpose of that magic are unclear.

The blister is a Medium object with AC 17; 30 hit points; vulnerability to fire and radiant damage; and immunity to acid, necrotic, and psychic damage. If destroyed, the blister bursts with a chorus of distant sighs. A moment later, a spectral figure appears.

#### Memory of Peace

If the characters destroy the spirit blister, the spirit of a ninuno appears and thanks them for releasing it from the bitter memories trapped within the blister. The spirit has forgotten its name, but it can share the following details:

- It was once a protector of Lambakluha and the temple that stood here, but when invaders burned the sacred tree Bathalang Puno and the surrounding city, the ninuno was overwhelmed by the pain of those who died.
- Angry spirits still haunt the island, their memories corrupting its vegetation and creatures.
- The spirit knows stories of Pangil ng Buwan, but fears that if the bakunawa went into dormancy on the island, wicked spirits could have corrupted it.
- The spirit encourages the characters to destroy any other spirit blisters they see and release the spirits brooding within. It knows that the blisters are vulnerable to flames and divine light.

After conversing with the characters, the spirit vanishes.

### Roots of Bathalang Puno

The swamps grow drier and more densely forested within a couple miles of Bathalang Puno, with vines and mangroves ensnaring ancient, overgrown ruins. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check knows that a great city once spread around the sacred tree; the crumbled structures are that city's ruins and the remnants of a destroyed skybridge called Moon's Respite.

Once the characters reach Bathalang Puno, they must still find Pangil ng Buwan's lair. Circling the great tree takes over an hour. But while searching for the lair, if a character succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check, they find marks suggesting the passage of a massive creature and can follow that trail to Pangil ng Buwan's lair in 10 minutes.

If the characters are not traveling with Paolo and his group, a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check notices booted tracks headed in the direction opposite them—the wrong way around the massive tree. These are the tracks of [Paolo Maykapal](/compendium/bestiary/npc/paolo-maykapal-jttrc.md) and his dragon hunters, who arrived ahead of the characters and who are also searching for the bakunawa.

#### Facing the Dragon Hunters

If the characters follow the dragon hunters, they catch up to them as the hunters conduct a stealthy—and slow—search. Paolo and his cousins are surprised to see the characters but aren't deterred from their hunt. If a character tells the dragon hunters that Pangil ng Buwan isn't behaving naturally and succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, Paolo wants to see the bakunawa himself and will decide its fate then. If hostilities break out, the [dragon hunters](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-hunter-jttrc.md) defend themselves, using the stat blocks of five [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) (see "The Dragon Hunters" earlier in this adventure).

#### The Bakunawa's Lair

Map 10.2 represents Pangil ng Buwan's lair. When the characters arrive, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Charred roots the size of buildings surround an open clearing with a broad patch of blackened ground. Nearby lie pieces of a fallen skybridge. At the clearing's center, writhing vines with glowing, green veins wrap around the massive form of Pangil ng Buwan. These vines emanate from four green, blister-like growths entangled amid the great tree's roots.
^31f

Whether the creature is alone or the dragon hunters are present depends on whether the characters found a direct path to the lair and whether they met the dragon hunters along the way. See "Dragon Hunters" below for more details.

Pangil ng Buwan (see the [bakunawa](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/bakunawa-jttrc.md) stat block at the end of this adventure) is covered in vines but is not [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained). The creature is half awake, resting as the corrupt vines spread hateful thoughts into its mind. Once the bakunawa notices creatures in its lair, it attacks.

##### Calming the Bakunawa

Pangil ng Buwan isn't currently in control of itself and can't be reasoned with, as the spirit blisters in its lair cause it to see the party as the invaders of Lambakluha who haunt its dreams. The dragon's eyes glow with sickly green light the same color as the nearby spirit blisters. If a creature casts [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (DC 15) or [greater restoration](/compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) on Pangil ng Buwan, the bakunawa is [stunned](/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn, but then its rage surges anew. The only way to end Pangil ng Buwan's rampage is destroying the four spirit blisters in its lair.

##### Corrupted Ground

Gigantic roots surround the area where Pangil ng Buwan rests. The roots and the rubble of the fallen skybridge are "difficult terrain".

At the center of the clearing, a patch of blighted ground marks the area of intense corruption where the bakunawa suffered years of nightmares. A creature that enters that area or starts its turn there is overwhelmed by visions of the burning of Bathalang Puno and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage.

##### Spirit Blisters

Four spirit blisters have corrupted the bakunawa's mind. A character who investigates a blister can make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) or Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. On a success, they notice the glow of the blisters matches the glow of the bakunawa's eyes.

The blisters are Medium objects with AC 17; 30 hit points; vulnerability to fire and radiant damage; and immunity to acid, necrotic, and psychic damage. Pangil ng Buwan defends the spirit blisters and prioritizes attacking any creature that damages the blisters.

##### Dragon Hunters

If, after arriving at the great tree, the characters took the direct path to Pangil ng Buwan's lair, the bakunawa is alone when they arrive, but Paolo and his [dragon hunters](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-hunter-jttrc.md) (five [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md); see "The Dragon Hunters" earlier in this adventure) arrive 3 rounds later. If the characters took an indirect path but didn't interact with the dragon hunters, the dragon hunters are already there and are about to attack.

Unless the characters have previously convinced Paolo to hold back, the dragon hunters immediately attack. Rather than rolling for the dragon hunters' attacks, assume any of the five [dragon hunters](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-hunter-jttrc.md) not engaged in combat with the characters or otherwise prevented from attacking deals 10 damage to Pangil ng Buwan each round. If a character points out to Paolo that the spirit blisters are affecting Pangil ng Buwan and succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, Paolo and his allies stand down.

##### Treasure

Pangil ng Buwan has a small hoard beneath the burnt tree roots. If the bakunawa is freed, it gives the characters its treasure in thanks. If it is slain, a character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the hidden cache beneath one of the giant roots. Pangil ng Buwan's treasure consists of 320 gp, 5,800 sp, three opal figurines of dugongs worth 150 gp a piece, an arrow of dragon slaying, a [necklace of adaptation](/compendium/items/necklace-of-adaptation.md), and a [staff of the python](/compendium/items/staff-of-the-python.md).

#### The End of Despair

If Pangil ng Buwan is cleansed of the spirit blisters' corruption, the bakunawa thanks the party for saving it and shares the following information:

- Pangil ng Buwan recounts the details in the "Background" section.
- The bakunawa remembers [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) fondly and was able to stop itself from harming the people of Kalapang when it sensed the ninuno's presence.
- If the characters mention Laguna, Pangil ng Buwan expresses remorse for not being there when the city was attacked. The bakunawa and Urian Maykapal, Paolo's ancestor, were close friends, but the day prior to the attack, the two had a disagreement. Pangil ng Buwan left Laguna to clear its head and heard about the violence too late.

## Conclusion

If the characters save Pangil ng Buwan, the bakunawa accompanies them back to Kalapang. Pangil ng Buwan apologizes to the townsfolk, explains the cause of the attack, and promises to aid in restoring the town. [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) and [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) reward the characters as promised, with [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) bestowing the Ninuno's Mark charm upon each of them (see "Ninuno's Mark" below).

If the party is unable to save Pangil ng Buwan, [Nimuel](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nimuel-jttrc.md) and [Lungtian](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lungtian-jttrc.md) accept their report of the corruption that destroyed the bakunawa, assigns them no blame, and pays them as promised. If Paolo's band slays the bakunawa and the characters leave them with its body, a week later the characters receive a parcel from Paolo with 150 gp and a bakunawa tooth for each character—their cut for assisting the dragon hunters or not standing in their way.

### Ninuno's Mark

A ninuno, one of the spirits of the Dayawlongon archipelago, grants you its insight as a charm (a type of "supernatural gift" detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). This charm allows you to cast either [augury](/compendium/spells/augury.md) or [speak with plants](/compendium/spells/speak-with-plants.md) once per day. Once used three times, this charm vanishes from you.

## Dayawlongon Gazetteer

For any first-time visitor to the archipelago of Dayawlongon, the skybridges are a stunning sight. Both roadways and refuges, with whole communities dwelling along some of the miles-long spans, these structures were built centuries ago with the help of great bakunawa—massive, serpentine dragons endemic to Dayawlongon's five main islands and dozens of smaller islands, which were much larger than the bakunawa that remain. The skybridges are the safest way to travel between many islands, high above the whirlpools that churn in the sea below. However, centuries of conflict have taken their toll on those structures; the great bakunawa whose bones and magic infuse them are long gone; and the artisan-warriors who maintain the bridges, known as bonesingers, are disappearing from history.

Dayawlongon has survived battles between its resident clans and the incursions of five foreign powers, and it has been independent and largely at peace for the last two centuries. In ages past, bakunawa served as mediators and defenders of the islands, but successive waves of invasion targeted the creatures, drastically reducing their numbers. Today, the islands' residents fiercely defend their home and seek to honor the history stolen by centuries of war.

### Features

Those familiar with the Dayawlongon archipelago know the following details:

- **Hallmarks.** The archipelago is known for the gigantic skybridges and sacred trees that tower over the islands. Serpentine Dragons called [bakunawa](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/bakunawa-jttrc.md), now rare, once defended the islands, and their bones and magic are infused into the skybridges.
- **People.** Most Dayawlongos are human, with dark hair and brown skin. Eyes of yellow, green, or brown are most common. Dragonborn and tieflings are also indigenous to the archipelago; many Dayawlongo dragonborn have iridescent scales and serpentine features, and many tieflings have iridescent feathers.
- **Languages.** Most folk in Dayawlongon speak Common and Snakesong, a dialect of Draconic that tales say was taught to the locals by bakunawa.

### Noteworthy Sites

Dayawlongon is a tropical archipelago whose waters hold massive whirlpools that make boat travel between the islands challenging. Winding rivers, deep jungles, and mountains define its five major islands.

#### Kalapang

Kalapang, the largest community on the island of Malabulak, stands among verdant fields. The city is a blend of old and new, with ancient religious sites and relics of foreign rule constructed alongside newer structures built by traders and immigrants looking for security. Kalapang is welcoming toward foreigners and encourages visitors. Powerful clans and the mercantile ventures regularly hire adventurers for trade excursions and exploration—such as journeys to the island of Lambakluha.

#### Lambakluha

The island of Lambakluha is known as the "Vale of Tears" in Snakesong. It was once the holiest place in Dayawlongon, home to Bathalang Puno, a temple city nestled within the roots of a colossal banyan tree that shared the city's name. That great tree was said to be where islanders' souls went after death. Some of these souls transcended into ninunos—dryad-like spirits of the land who serve as stewards to the gods and resided in the surrounding lands. Colonizing invaders burned the great tree and razed Bathalang Puno, killing untold people and spirits alike. In the aftermath, Lambakluha became a cursed place, where spirits seethe in the land, spreading corruption across the island.

Decades ago, an expedition from Kalapang set up a camp on the island called the Final Steps of Courage, hoping to exorcise the land's tormented spirits. Thus far, these soldiers and scholars have made little progress toward their goal.

#### Skybridges

A gift from bakunawa to the first folk of the archipelago, the skybridges of Dayawlongon are magical feats of architecture that connect many of the region's islands. Travelers are common, and the most traveled skybridges hold small communities where they can rest and resupply. Legend holds that the bones of enormous bakunawa were infused into the skybridges in ages past, with the creatures' blessing. Only bonesingers, people chosen as stewards of the skybridges, know how to maintain the magic that keeps the skybridges safe.

### Life in Dayawlongon

Several truths shape life on the Dayawlongon archipelago; some are deeply rooted traditions, and others have been molded by foreign influences.

#### Ancestral Strength

Reverence toward one's ancestors is deeply ingrained in Dayawlongo society, where a passion for the past is demonstrated by people's love for oaths, poetry, and song. Ancestors sometimes return as guardians called ninunos, spirits of the dead who have taken on new, dryad-like forms and serve as intercessors between mortals, the gods, and the land. Ninunos watch over their bloodlines, bestowing good fortune on pious descendants or curses upon those who put their own needs over those of the family and broader community.

#### Bonesingers

Artisan-warriors, bonesingers dedicate their lives to maintaining the skybridges. In the ancient past, bonesingers oversaw the final rites when great bakunawa died, then infused the creatures' bones into the magical bridges that unite Dayawlongon as one land. During the days of the first colonial incursions, bonesingers became Dayawlongon's earliest freedom fighters, but their victories came at a great cost. Many skybridges became battlegrounds, and countless allied bakunawa were lost. Today, the gigantic bakunawa of old are gone, and few of their smaller descendants remain. The loss of these great creatures and their magic prevents the creation of new skybridges.

#### Clans and Reputation

Dozens of clans unite families across the Dayawlongon archipelago. Marriages are unions of clans as much as unions between individuals. Adoptions, polyamorous relationships, and other generous family bonds create varied ways to join different clans. Clans have few proscribed roles for their members, with each group sharing responsibilities in ways that work for their members.

Reputation carries great value in Dayawlongon, and a person's reputation also shapes that of their loved ones in the eyes of peers. A Dayawlongo treats their best friend's children like their own offspring and curses the names of their enemy's family.

#### Debt of the Soul

One of the cornerstones of Dayawlongo culture is the concept of _utang ng loob_, a debt of the soul. If someone saves another from mortal peril or assists another at great cost to themself, a soul debt is formed between the people in question and their bloodlines. This debt holds throughout any number of generations until it is repaid. Failing to respect a soul debt is the deepest form of betrayal for Dayawlongos and the root of countless blood feuds.

#### Names

Traditionally, Dayawlongos have a personal name followed by a clan name. Personal names are varied and often reflect a characteristic that a ninuno connected to an individual or their family found desirable. However, some personal names are relics of colonization and have foreign origins. The following names are common in Dayawlongo:

- **Feminine.** Asterio, Corazon, Flordeliza, Modesta, Sinta
- **Masculine.** Amado, Estanislao, Gio, Joaquin, Mirikit
- **Gender-Neutral.** Alon, Bulan, Dalisay, Melchor
- **Clan Names.** Bahaghari, Dimansalang, Fabion, Posadas, Recio

### Legends of Dayawlongon

Ancient belief states that all life on Dayawlongon is born from the spoken words of a poet goddess—known as Kamatayang-Langit—from which comes the people's deep reverence for poetry and song. This is why every community has one or more binukots, bards who serve as living repositories of art, culture, custom, and law. The death of a binukot can result in the loss of generations of history, as Dayawlongo tradition eschews writing stories or songs down. Bonesingers maintain that bakunawa are among the greatest binukots, their vast memories making them bearers of ancient truths.

### Characters from Dayawlongon

If players want to create characters from the Dayawlongon archipelago, ask them the following questions:

**What stories can you tell about yourself?** Has a ninuno ever spoken to you? Is a particular song, poem, or tale the binukots tell your favorite? What stories do you want others to tell about you after your death?

**What do you think of bakunawa?** Does a bakunawa feature in your family's history? Do you believe bakunawa are creatures to be revered or monsters?

**Are you trained as a binukot?** Do you collect the stories of your people? Do you want to broaden your peoples' knowledge by collecting stories from distant lands and sharing them at home?

## Bakunawa

Worshiped as draconic avatars of storm and tide, bakunawa soar over the archipelagos they call home. Iridescent scales crackling with lightning cover a bakunawa's fearsome serpentine body, and the sharp movements of its mighty wings echo with thunderous winds. Known for their mercilessness in battle, bakunawa swallow whole any who challenge them.
