## Description

Verbeeg are giants that resemble oversized humans with gangly limbs and elongated faces. Some have other features that give them a fearsome aspect.

Verbeeg craft their own armor and weapons. They prefer thrown spears above all other weapons, and a verbeeg usually has several spears for that purpose.

**Marauders.** Verbeeg conduct themselves like brigands, robbing people they come across in the wild. If food is scarce, they kill those same people and eat them. They prefer to dwell in forlorn places, often sharing territory with hill giants and ogres. It's not unusual to find a gang of hill giants and ogres led by a verbeeg, since verbeeg are much smarter than their brutish cousins. Verbeeg also enjoy the company of mammalian beasts and allow bears, wolves, worgs, and other predators to lair with them. They catch and keep horses, mules, sheep, goats, and cattle for food and trade.
