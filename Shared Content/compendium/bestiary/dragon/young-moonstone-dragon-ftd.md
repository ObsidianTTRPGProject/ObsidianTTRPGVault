## Description

Ancient legends suggest that when the gods came to the First World and tried to populate it with their Humanoid followers, a clever dragon fled to the Feywild to hide a clutch of eggs. The magic of that faerie realm suffused the eggs, which hatched into the first moonstone dragons. Their descendants are now found throughout the Feywild.

Moonstone dragons are graceful and elegant creatures with opalescent scales and ruffs of emerald-green fur running down their chins, chests, backs, and tails. One horn arcs from the back of a moonstone dragon's skull and another at the tip of the nose; the two horns together form a shape that's reminiscent of a slender crescent moon. Moonstone dragons are playful and impetuous forces of mischief in their early years, but the best of them mature into wise teachers and storytellers who anchor Feywild communities. The worst of them are pompous and ill behaved, but even those remain gentle by nature and curious about all things—especially travelers from faraway places.

Moonstone dragons can project themselves into the realm of dreams to communicate with the creatures that sleep near their lairs. In this way, they inspire artists and poets, encourage great thinkers, and spur adventurers to heroic deeds. They sometimes give guidance to those in need or request help from adventurers to encourage them to greatness.

As a rule, moonstone dragons are not particularly interested in gold or copper, but they love silver, platinum, and mithral. They also cherish treasures whose value can't be easily quantified—a song sung from the heart, a lock of a loved one's hair, or a painting of a favorite place. A story of happy times fondly remembered is more precious to a moonstone dragon than a sack of gold.

**Creating a Moonstone Dragon.** Use the Moonstone Dragon Personality Traits and Moonstone Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive moonstone dragon characters.

**Moonstone Dragon Personality Traits.** | dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I often lose track of whether I'm in the Feywild or on the Material Plane. |
| 2 | I have been known to throw caution to the wind when in pursuit of new items for my hoard. |
| 3 | No matter how old I get, I always delight in harmless pranks and tricks. |
| 4 | I've always been mature for my age, and I can't wait for the day I can retire to my lair to be taken care of by doting fey. |
| 5 | I look down upon any being who resorts to violence to solve a problem. |
| 6 | Conversing with others is often difficult because I'm so easily distr... oh my goodness, is that circlet made of silver? |
| 7 | I find the waking world tedious and mundane and would much rather spend my time asleep, in the realm of dreams. |
| 8 | I find the whimsy of fey, and whimsy in general, to be exasperating and exhausting. |

**Moonstone Dragon Ideals.** | dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Curiosity. I might never be able to experience everything in the multiverse—but it doesn't hurt to try. (Any) |
| 2 | Nonviolence. Violence need never be the answer in a multiverse of infinite possibilities. (Neutral) |
| 3 | Whimsy. Why waste time on boring, ordinary concerns when the world is filled with fantastic and ludicrous wonders? (Chaotic) |
| 4 | Beauty. There is beauty to be found in even the simplest things if you look hard enough. (Good) |
| 5 | Inspiration. Great are history's artists and creators. But greater still are those who inspire them. (Any) |
| 6 | Power. Creatures are at their most vulnerable in their dreams, and I am the master of dreams. (Evil) |

**Moonstone Dragon Adventures.** The Moonstone Dragon Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for stories and adventures involving moonstone dragons.

**Moonstone Dragon Adventure Hooks.** | dice: d8 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A wealthy and well-known artist's muse—a moonstone dragon—has stopped appearing in their dreams. The artist is desperate to hire adventurers to find the dragon. |
| 2 | A clutch of moonstone dragons has discovered a portal to the Material Plane and is wreaking havoc on nearby villages, pilfering every bit of silver the locals own. |
| 3 | A moonstone dragon seeks the platinum crown of a Fey prince—and will do anything to get it. |
| 4 | A gluttonous moonstone dragon is consuming all the moonlight in a small forest, making the darkened path through the woods ideal for banditry. |
| 5 | A moonstone dragon hosts a storytelling competition in the Feywild, and the winner gets to claim any one item on display in the dragon's lair. |
| 6 | A moonstone dragon, offended by gifts of gold, is causing nightmares among the local nobility. |
| 7 | A powerful spellcaster is forcing a captive moonstone dragon to invade the dreams of adventurers, sending parties on quests to assist the spellcaster's nefarious schemes. |
| 8 | A moonstone dragon that accidentally stumbled through a portal to the Material Plane can't find a way back home to the Feywild. |

**Connected Creatures.** In the Feywild, moonstone dragons interact mostly with pixies, sprites, and other Fey creatures who revere and serve the dragon. Outside the Feywild, they often prefer to communicate with other creatures through dreams.

**Young Moonstone Dragon Connections.** | dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A young moonstone dragon on the cusp of adulthood refuses to settle down and build a lair. To protect the local populace from the dragon's chaotic activities, a minor deity sends a deva to temper the dragon's mischievous spirit. |
| 2 | A young moonstone dragon fell victim to a fomorian's curse and has elected to stay with the Giant rather than reveal this magical affliction. |
| 3 | A treant and a young moonstone dragon love to meet and share stories. While the dragon speaks of travels and adventures, the treant tells tales of the tiny moments that make up a forest's life. |
| 4 | A young moonstone dragon has acquired a powerful magic item belonging to one of the fey courts and is leading the assassin sent to retrieve the item on a chase through the Feywild. |
| 5 | A young moonstone dragon has joined a pack of blink dogs for a year and a day. The dragon pretends to be a blink dog and refuses to admit otherwise until this time with the pack expires. |
| 6 | A young moonstone dragon and a night hag repeatedly encounter each other in the dream realm, but they have never met in the flesh. |
