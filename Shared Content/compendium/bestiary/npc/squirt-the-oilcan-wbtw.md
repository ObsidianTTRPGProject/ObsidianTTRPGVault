## Description

**Roleplaying Notes.** Originally a nonsentient oilcan, Squirt was carried to the Feywild by dwarves hoping to harvest boggle oil. Though the expedition was a success, the dwarves were put to sleep by pixie magic. During a celebration that erupted around them, an elf used her magic to animate the oilcan in jest. Having come alive at a party, Squirt was imbued with the urge to seek out fun wherever it can be found.

**Alignment.** Chaotic neutral.

**Personality Trait.** "Why do something yourself when you can have someone else do it for you?"

**Ideal.** "No use sitting about getting rusty when there's fun to be had. Let's party!"

**Bond.** "I'm running on fumes here. I need oil."

**Flaw.** "I'm too tired to fly today. You carry me."
