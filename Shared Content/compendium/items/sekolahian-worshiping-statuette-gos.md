# Sekolahian Worshiping Statuette
*Wondrous Item, common*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Skillfully carved from sandstone, this 1-foot-tall statuette depicts a shark twisting through the water with its mouth open. If any Tiny sea-dwelling animal is within 1 inch of the statuette's mouth, the shark flashes to life and deals 1 piercing damage to it. The shark can deal damage in this way no more than once per hour.
