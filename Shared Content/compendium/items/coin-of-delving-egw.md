# Coin of Delving
*Wondrous Item, common*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This scintillating copper coin sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. If dropped a distance greater than 5 feet, the coin issues a melodious ringing sound when it hits a surface. Any creature that can hear the chime can determine the distance the coin dropped based on the tone.
