# Amulet of Harmony
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

The amulet is a golden disk about 4 inches across. There are symbols etched into its surface and there are six bezels that hold the Gems of Power.

The Amulet of Harmony has the following properties:

- While attuned to this amulet, you feel a pull in the direction of the Prismatic Well.
- If the Prismatic Well is dormant, you can restore its power by expending your own energy. You must be within 10-feet of the well to restore its power and you must say the words, "I invoke the power of the Prismatic Well and restore the colors of Harmony for all." If you do so, roll a d6. On a 2-6, the power of the well is restored. On a 1, the well is restored but you fall into a deep, magical slumber for 1 year and cannot be roused except by a remove curse spell or similar magic.
- You can turn off the power of the Prismatic Well, plunging all of Harmony into a polarized world where everything is horribly black and white. To do this, you must be within 10-feet of the well and you must say the words, "I revoke the power of the Prismatic Well and withhold the colors of Harmony to all." If you do so, roll a d6. On a 3-6, the well is turned off. On 1-2, the power of the well remains and you turn into a statue of black stone.

Only a wish spell can undo this effect.
