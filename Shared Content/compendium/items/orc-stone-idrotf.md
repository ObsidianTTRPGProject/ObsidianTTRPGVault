# Orc Stone
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a recipient only)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

I saved the life of an orc, who gave me a stone with the symbol of the Many-Arrows tribe (a humanoid skull pierced by three arrows) carved into it. The stone is an uncommon magic item that requires attunement, and only I can attune to it.

As an action, I can use the stone to summon the spirit of an orc warrior, which appears within 30 feet of me. The spirit uses the [orc war chief](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc-war-chief.md) stat block in the Monster Manual and disappears after 10 minutes or when reduced to 0 hit points. The spirit understands any language I speak and obeys my commands.

After the stone is used three times, it turns to dust. (See Appendix B of Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden)
