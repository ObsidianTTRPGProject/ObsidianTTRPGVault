# Black Ghost Orchid Seed
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Every few years, a ghost orchid colony grows a black pod as thick as a human fist that holds three soft, black seeds. A creature that consumes one of these black seeds is affected by the spell [feign death](/compendium/spells/feign-death.md). If the creature is unaware of the pod's effects or does not wish to be affected, it can resist the effect by succeeding on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Otherwise, it is considered to be a willing recipient of the spell.
