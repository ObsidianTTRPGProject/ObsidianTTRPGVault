# Hook of Fisher's Delight
*Wondrous Item, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This tiny silver fishhook has a little gold feather attached to it. For it to function, the feathered hook must be tied to the end of a fishing line and immersed in enough water to fill at least a 10-foot cube. At the end of each uninterrupted hour of immersion, roll a d6. On a 6, a floppy, 6-inch-long magical fish appears on the end of the hook. The color and properties of the conjured fish are determined by rolling on the Hook of Fisher's Delight table. Once the hook conjures a fish, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

**Hook of Fisher's Delight**

| dice: d20 | Fish Color | Result |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1-10 | Green with copper bands | This tasty fish provides a day's worth of nourishment to one creature that eats it. The fish loses this property and rots if it's not eaten within 24 hours of being caught. |
| 11-14 | Yellow with black stripes | Once removed from the hook, this awful-tasting fish can be thrown up to 120 feet, targeting a creature the thrower can see. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone). The fish then disappears. |
| 15-18 | Blue with white bands | When released from the hook, this fish squirms free, sprouts wings, follows you around, and sings a beautiful tune in Aquan. It disappears after 2d4 hours or when reduced to 0 hit points. The fish uses the [quipper](/compendium/bestiary/beast/quipper.md) stat block, except that it can breathe air and has a flying speed of 30 feet. |
| 19-20 | Gold with silver stripes | This tasty fish provides a day's worth of nourishment to one creature that eats it and grants 2d10 temporary hit points to that creature. The fish loses these properties and rots if it's not eaten within 24 hours of being caught. |
