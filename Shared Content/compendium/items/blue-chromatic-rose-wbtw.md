# Blue Chromatic Rose
*Wondrous Item, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While this rose is held, it crackles with lightning as a harmless visual effect.

While holding the rose by its stem, you gain resistance to lightning damage. If you would take more than 10 lightning damage from a single source (after applying the resistance), the rose disintegrates, and you take no damage instead.

As an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of lightning. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property destroys the rose.
