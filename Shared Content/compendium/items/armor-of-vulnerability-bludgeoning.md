# Armor of Vulnerability (Bludgeoning)

- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Cost**: ⏤

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning damage.

## Curse

This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an [identify](/compendium/spells/identify.md) spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to piercing and slashing damage.
