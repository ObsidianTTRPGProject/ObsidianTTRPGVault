# Green Copper Ewer
*Other, unknown (magic)*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Any poisonous liquid poured into the ewer is instantly transformed into an equal amount of sweet wine. Furthermore, a creature that grasps the ewer's handle can command the ewer to fill with 1 gallon of wine, and it can't produce more wine until the next dawn.
