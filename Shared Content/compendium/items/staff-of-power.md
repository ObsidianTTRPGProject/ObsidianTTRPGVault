This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8 + 2 charges.

## Power Strike

When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

## Spells

While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [cone of cold](/compendium/spells/cone-of-cold.md) (5 charges), [fireball](/compendium/spells/fireball.md) (5th-level version, 5 charges), [globe of invulnerability](/compendium/spells/globe-of-invulnerability.md) (6 charges), [hold monster](/compendium/spells/hold-monster.md) (5 charges), [levitate](/compendium/spells/levitate.md) (2 charges). [lightning bolt](/compendium/spells/lightning-bolt.md) (5th-level version, 5 charges), [magic missile](/compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) (1 charge), [ray of enfeeblement](/compendium/spells/ray-of-enfeeblement.md) (1 charge), or [wall of force](/compendium/spells/wall-of-force.md) (5 charges).

## Retributive Strike

You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50% chance chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

| Distance from Origin | Effect |
|----------------------|--------|
| 10 ft. away or closer | 8 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 11 to 20 ft. away | 6 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 21 to 30 ft. away | 4 × the number of charges in the staff |
