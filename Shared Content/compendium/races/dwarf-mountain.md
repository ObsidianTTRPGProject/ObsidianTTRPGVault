## Traits

### Age

Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

### Size

Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

### Speed

Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

### Darkvision

Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Dwarven Resilience

You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

### Dwarven Combat Training

You have proficiency with the [battleaxe](/compendium/items/battleaxe.md), [handaxe](/compendium/items/handaxe.md), [light hammer](/compendium/items/light-hammer.md), and [warhammer](/compendium/items/warhammer.md).

### Tool Proficiency

You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: [Smith's tools](/compendium/items/smiths-tools.md), [brewer's supplies](/compendium/items/brewers-supplies.md), or [mason's tools](/compendium/items/masons-tools.md).

### Stonecunning

Whenever you make an Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the [History](/rules/skills.md#History) skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

### Dwarven Armor Training

You have proficiency with light and medium armor.
