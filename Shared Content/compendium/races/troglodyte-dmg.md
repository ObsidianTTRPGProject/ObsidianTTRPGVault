Any creature other than a troglodyte that starts its turn within 5 ft. of you must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all troglodytes for 1 hour.
