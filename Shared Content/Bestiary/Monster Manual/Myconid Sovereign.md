## Special Traits
***Distress Spores.*** When the myconid takes damage, all other [[Myconids|myconids]] within 240 feet of it can sense its pain.

***Sun Sickness.*** While in sunlight, the myconid has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The myconid uses either its Hallucination Spores or its Pacifying Spores, then makes a fist attack.

***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (`dice: 3d4+1`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`dice: 3d4`) poison damage.

***Animating Spores (3/Day).*** The myconid targets one corpse of a humanoid or a Large or smaller beast within 5 feet of it and releases spores at the corpse. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a spore servant. The corpse stays animated for `dice: 1d4+1` weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way.

***Hallucination Spores.*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be  poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target is  incapacitated while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Pacifying Spores.*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be  stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Rapport Spores.*** A 30-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
