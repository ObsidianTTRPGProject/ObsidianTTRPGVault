## Special Traits
***Cunning Action.*** On each of its turns, the thief can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

***Evasion.*** If the thief is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the thief instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The thief deals an extra 14 (`dice: 4d6`) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the thief that isn't incapacitated and the thief doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The thief makes three attacks with its shortsword.

***Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage.

***Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) piercing damage.

## Reactions
***Uncanny Dodge.*** The thief halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The thief must be able to see the attacker.

## Description
Master thieves are known for perpetrating daring heists. They tend to develop a reputation and a cult of personality. A master thief might "retire" from hands-on work to run a thieves' guild, spearhead some covert enterprise, or enjoy a quiet life of luxury.
