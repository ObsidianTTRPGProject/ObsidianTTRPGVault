1st level (4 slots): *bane, healing word, sanctuary, shield of faith*

2nd level (3 slots): *hold person, spiritual weapon (dagger)*

***Fey Ancestry.*** The choldrith has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the choldrith to sleep.

***Spider Climb.*** The choldrith can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the choldrith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the choldrith knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The choldrith ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

## Description
[[Chitine|Chitines]] are multiarmed humanoids with arachnid qualities that serve Lolth. They operate in well-organized colonies that prove to be effective fighters in the war against the enemies of the Demon Queen of Spiders. On occasion, Lolth pits [[Chitine|chitines]] against dark elves-even though both groups worship her-as a way of punishing the drow, who created the [[Chitine|chitines]] but displeased their goddess by doing so.

***Unnatural Orisin.*** Long ago, the drow first subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that transformed the captives into creatures with both humanoid and spider traits, which their creators dubbed [[Chitine|chitines]]. The dark elves' intention was to create slaves dedicated first of all to the drow and, by association with them, to Lolth. As the drow ultimately discovered, the goddess found this arrangement unacceptable.

The creation process required cooperation between magical disciplines. Drow wizards and warlocks used arcane magic and demonic powers, and drow priestesses invoked Lolth's aid for the divine spark needed to ensure the subject's survival. Lolth watched, expecting at some part of the process to see these new abominations dedicated to her, but no such ritu,al was performed. In retribution for this lack of respect, the Spider Queen twisted the drow's creation rituals to serve her own purposes.

***Lolth's Revenge.*** As the drow continued to perform the rituals, the process usually transformed the subject into the spindly, stunted creature they expected. Occasionally, though, the elf changed into a monstrosity that was more spider than elf, resembling Lolth in her spider form, and more cunning than a [[Chitine|chitine]], that the drow dubbed a choldrith.

At first, the drow were unaware that the new creatures were signs of Lolth's displeasure with them. Instead, they were pleased, because choldriths could lay eggs that birthed more [[Chitine|chitines]] (and the rare choldrith) and could direct the chi tines in their work. But the dark elves came to realize their mistake- choldriths belonged to Lolth, body and soul. They whispered to the [[Chitine|chitines]] of their adoration of the Spider Queen and their enmity of the drow, and the seeds of a rebellion took root and grew. The [[Chitine|chitines]] and choldriths rose up against their would-be masters; soon afterward most of the creatures were free, and a number of the drow who helped breed and tend them were dead.

Nowadays, drow still create [[Chitine|chitines]] when they have need to. Outside the presence of a choldrith, [[Chitine|chitines]] make good workers for the drow, and they can be useful if the drow find an independent [[Chitine|chitine]] colony and want to infiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, though, the drow destroy the creature immediately.

***Lolth's Chosen.*** Choldriths are born with a fanatical devotion to Lolth, which leads them to develop some skill in divine magic. They preach that [[Chitine|chitines]] are Lolth's favored people, and that choldriths are the Spider Queen's rightful worldly representatives sent to free the [[Chitine|chitines]] from slavery. Although choldriths and [[Chitine|chitines]] lack sexual characteristics, and choldriths need no mate to lay eggs, these creatures choose the gender identity of their goddess. Choldriths also believe and teach that Lolth's spider form, much like that of a choldrith, is her truest shape. Any idol to Lolth in a [[Chitine|chitine]] colony depicts Lolth in this way.

As servants of Lolth, choldriths and [[Chitine|chitines]] love spiders and spiderlike creatures. They rear spiders and similar arachnids, such as [[Cave Fisher|cave fishers]]. [[Chitine]] colonies erect shrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attracting spiders and other evil, brutish beings that serve her. Anywhere [[Chitine|chitines]] set up a colony quickly becomes a web-shrouded, gloomy, and treacherous place.

***Communal Spiders.*** [[Chitine|Chitines]] and choldriths resemble spiders, but they behave more like social insects such as ants. [[Chitine|Chitines]] are divided into worker and warrior castes, and choldriths occupy the top levels of a colony's hierarchy. Each [[Chitine|chitine]] has a social position that comes with duties related to that rank, and all [[Chitine|chitines]] are expected to willingly sacrifice themselves to protect the choldriths. Every [[Chitine|chitine]] has spinnerets and slowly produces webbing that is used to build floors, walls, structures, objects, and traps that benefit and protect the colony. A warrior might be responsible for crafting web armor (which is as tough as hide or leather), while a group of workers might be tasked to dig a pit trap and cover it with fragile webbing disguised with loose dirt to appear as a solid surface.

A colony can support numerous choldriths, which serve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. The choldriths continually jockey for position, although they rarely confront one another in a way that puts the colony at risk. The colony is ruled by a singular sovereign that determines which colony members perform which tasks, including whether she or any other choldrith is permitted to lay eggs. If this supreme ruler receives a vision from Lolth, she might change her colony's entire course of action. At such times, [[Chitine|chitines]] have emerged from the Underdark to settle in remote, gloomy places on the surface, from where they can wage war on other species, especially drow and elves.
