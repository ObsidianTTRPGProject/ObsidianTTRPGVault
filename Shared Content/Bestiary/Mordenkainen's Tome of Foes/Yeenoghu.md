## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** Yeenoghu's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: *detect magic*
3/day each: *dispel magic, fear, invisibility*
1/day: *teleport*

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Yeenoghu fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Yeenoghu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Yeenoghu's weapon attacks are magical.

***Rampage.*** When Yeenoghu reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on his turn, Yeenoghu can take a bonus action to move up to half his speed and make a bite attack.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** Yeenoghu makes three flail attacks. If an attack hits, he can cause it to create an additional effect of his choice or at random (each effect can be used only once per Multiattack):

1. The attack deals an extra 13 ( `dice: 2d12`) bludgeoning damage.
1. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the start of Yeenoghu's next turn.
1. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the confusion spell until the start of Yeenoghu's next turn.

***Flail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ( `dice: 1d12+9`) bludgeoning damage.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ( `dice: 1d10+9`) piercing damage.

## Legendary Actions
The Yeenoghu can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Yeenoghuregains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Charge.** Yeenoghu moves up to his speed.

**Swat Away.** Yeenoghu makes a flail attack. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in a straight line away from Yeenoghu. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target falls prone.

**Savage (Costs 2 Actions).** Yeenoghu makes a bite attack against each creature within 10 feet of him.

## Description
The Beast of Butchery appears as a great battle-scarred gnoll, towering 14 feet tall. Yeenoghu is the Gnoll Lord, and his creations are made in his twisted image. When the demon lord hunted across the Material Plane, packs of hyenas followed in his wake. Those that ate of great Yeenoghu's kills became gnolls, emulating their master's ways. Few others worship the Beast of Butchery, but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect, hunched over, and filing their teeth down to points.

Yeenoghu wants nothing more than slaughter and senseless destruction. The gnolls are his instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater atrocities in his name. Yeenoghu takes pleasure in causing fear before death, and he sows sorrow and despair through destroying beloved things. He doesn't parlay; to meet him is to do battle with him—unless he becomes bored. The Beast of Butchery has a long rivalry with [[Baphomet]], the Horned King, and the two demon lords and their followers attack one another on sight.

The Gnoll Lord is covered in matted fur and taut, leathery hide, his face like a grinning predator's skull. Patchwork armor made of discarded shields and breastplates is lashed onto his body with heavy chains, decorated by the flayed skins of his foes. He wields a triple-headed flail called the Butcher, which he can summon into his hand at will, although he is as likely to tear his prey apart with his bare hands before ripping out its throat with his teeth.

## Yeenoghu's Lair
Yeenoghu's lair in the Abyss is called the Death Dells, its barren hills and ravines serving as one great hunting ground, where he pursues captured mortals in a cruel game. Yeenoghu's lair is a place of blood and death, populated by gnolls, hyenas, and ghouls, and there are few structures or signs of civilization on his layer of the Abyss.

### Lair Actions
On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Yeenoghu can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects: he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Yeenoghu causes an iron spike - 5 feet tall and 1 inch in diameter - to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 100 feet of him. Any creature in the space where the spike emerges must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (`dice: 6d8`) piercing damage and is restrained by being impaled on the spike. A creature can use an action to remove itself (or a creature it can reach) from the spike, ending the restrained condition.
- Each gnoll or hyena that Yeenoghu can see can use its reaction to move up to its speed.
- Until the next initiative count 20, all gnolls and hyenas within the lair are enraged, causing them to have advantage on melee weapon attack rolls and causing attack rolls to have advantage against them.

### Regional Effects
The region containing Yeenoghu's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- Within 1 mile of the lair, large iron spikes grow out of the ground and stone surfaces. Yeenoghu impales the bodies of the slain on these spikes.
- Predatory beasts within 6 miles of the lair become unusually savage, killing far more than what they need for food. Carcasses of prey are left to rot in an unnatural display of wasteful slaughter.
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Yeenoghu table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

If Yeenoghu dies, these effects fade over the course of `dice: 1d10` days.

## Madness of Yeenoghu
If a creature goes mad in Yeenoghu's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Yeenoghu table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more on madness.

**Madness of Yeenoghu**


| **`dice: d100`** | **Flaw (lasts until cured)** |
|---|---|
| 01-20 | "I often become withdrawn and moody, dwelling on the insufferable state of life." |
| 21-40 | "I am compelled to make the weak suffer." |
| 41-60 | "I have no compunction against tampering with the dead in my search to better understand death." |
| 61-80 | "I want to achieve the everlasting existence of undeath." |
| 81-00 | "I am awash in the awareness of life's futility." |
