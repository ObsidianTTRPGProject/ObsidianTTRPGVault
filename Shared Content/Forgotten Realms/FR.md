# Forgotten Realms
![[Pasted image 20220107220453.png|right]] The Forgotten Realms is a fictional alternate world that has been published as a campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), Advanced Dungeon & Dragons (AD&D), Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition(2e), 3rd Edition Dungeons & Dragons (3e), and 4th Edition Dungeons and Dragons (4e), by TSR, Inc. and Wizards of the Coast (WotC). The setting is also referenced in the 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons core books, though it has not yet been published as its own separate setting.

It was originally created in 1967 as a setting for short stories by Ed Greenwood, but it has since become one of the most enduring campaign settings for D&D.



The primary focus of the setting is the continent of Faerûn, part of the world of Abeir-Toril, an Earth-like planet with certain obvious influences and similarities from the real world and fantasy fiction.

The Forgotten Realms setting owes a lot of its popularity to the many novels using the setting, like R. A. Salvatore's works detailing the life and adventures of the famed drow Drizzt Do'Urden, as well as computer games like Pool of Radiance, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights.

## History
**Time of Troubles**
The Time of Troubles was a cataclysmic time period in the history of Faerûn. Taking place during 1358 DR, the Year of Shadows, the Time of Troubles was a period during which the deities of Faerûn were forced to walk the earth in their mortal avatar forms. Several major deities died during the Time of Troubles (see deaths, ascensions, and resurrections) and a handful of mortals rose to divinity.

**Present day**
The interpretation of the term "present day" in the Forgotten Realms depends entirely upon the context in which it is used. Dungeon Masters are free to use the first, second, third, fourth or fifth edition sourcebooks to form a setting for their games of D&D. Alternatively, they may set their games at any point during the Realms' past or future. The novels set in the Realms cover a wide variety of time periods too. This wiki does not focus on one specific time as being the "present day" - instead, it endeavours to provide specific date references where possible.

## Geography
The planet of Abeir-Toril consists of several large continents, including Faerûn, the focus of the setting, which was first detailed in the original Forgotten Realms Campaign Set, published in 1987 by TSR. The other continents include Kara-Tur, Zakhara, Maztica, Anchorome, Laerakond and other as-yet unspecified landmasses. Kara-Tur, roughly corresponding to ancient East Asia, was later the focus of its own publication, Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms, released in 1988.

Various products detailing specific areas of Faerûn have been released, and much of the continent has been heavily detailed and documented to create a highly developed setting. See the sourcebooks portal for an extensive list of products.

In early publications about the setting, The Realms shared a unified cosmology with various other campaign settings. In this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With the release of the 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.

## Realmspace
The Forgotten Realms world of Abeir-Toril is but one of several other worlds in the Realmspace crystal sphere. To the natives of Faerûn, the wildspace above their heads is known as the Sea of Night. The two closest worlds to the sun in the middle of Realmspace are known as the Dawn Heralds, and they are barely visible only at sunset or sunrise. Beyond Abeir-Toril further out in the crystal sphere are the Five Wanderers, five worlds which flow through star-rivers in an uneven course through wildspace. Some of these worlds are inhabited by humans, dwarves, and orcs, but also more sinister races such as illithids and beholders.

Realmspace was the term used to describe the Torilian system and its surrounding environs within the Prime Material Plane. To those on the surface of Toril, Realmspace was called the Sea of Night, while the Netherese referred to it as the Skyward Realms. Contained within a crystal sphere suspended in the enormous expanse of the phlogiston, Realmspace consisted of wildspace (empty vacuum), a sun, eight planets and their satellites, and a variety of asteroids, comets, and nebulae.

## The Elemental Planes
### Overview
Planes of existence define the extremes of strange - often dangerous environments. The most bizarre locations present settings undreamed of in the natural world. Planar adventures offer unprecedented dangers and wonders. Adventurers walk on streets made of solid fire or test their mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.

### The Planes
The various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but dimensions formed and governed by spiritual and thought. ental principles.

The Outer Planes are realms of spirituality and thought. They are the spheres where celestials, fiends, and deities exist. The plane of Elysium, for example, isn't merely a place where good creatures dwell, and not even simply the place where spirits of good creatures go when they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual realm where evil can't flourish. It is as much a state of being and of mind as it is a physical location.

The Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence and elemental nature of air, earth, fire, and water. The Elemental [[Plane of Fire]], for example, embodies the essence of fire. The plane's entire substance is suffused with the fundamental nature of fire: energy, passion, transformation, and destruction. Even objects of solid brass or basalt seem to dance with flame, in a visible and palpable manifestation of the vibrancy of fire's dominion.

In this context, the Material Plane is the nexus where all these philosophical and elemental forces collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and matter. The worlds of D&D exist within the Material Plane, makingit the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.

### Planar Categories
The planes of the default D&D cosmology are grouped in the following categories:

**The Material Plane and Its Echoes**. The [[Plane of Faerie|Feywild]] and the [[Plane of Shadow|Shadowfell]] are reflections of the Material Plane.

**The Transitive Planes**. The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are mostly featureless planes that serve primarily as pathways to travel from one plane to another.

**The Inner Planes**. The four Elemental Planes (Air, Earth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that surrounds them, are the Inner Planes.

**The Outer Planes**. Sixteen Outer Planes correspond to the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of philosophical difference between them.

**The Positive and Negative Planes**. These two planes enfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw forces of life and death that underlie the rest of exis tence in the multiverse.

# Prime Material Plane
## Overview
**Dimensional Region**: Plane
#Dimensional-Region/Plane

The Prime Material Plane is the plane in which Toril and the surrounding cosmos exists. The phrase "Prime Material Plane," or simply the "Prime," is generally used by beings from other planes in the Forgotten Realms cosmology (notably Sigil), and "prime" is used by the same beings to refer to the inhabitants of Toril.

There is supposedly an infinite number of material planes, among them the Prime Material Plane, the Abeiran material plane, Oerth's material plane, Krynn's material plane, and the universe in which Earth is located. However, in the cosmology shared by the Planescape and Spelljammer campaign settings, there is only one material plane (called the Prime Material Plane), which contains the crystal spheres of many different worlds separated by the Phlogiston.
