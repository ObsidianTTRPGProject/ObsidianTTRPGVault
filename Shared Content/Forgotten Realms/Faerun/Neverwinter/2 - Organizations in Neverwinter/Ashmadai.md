The Ashmadai were a secretive devil worshiping cult based in Neverwinter dedicated to the god Asmodeus. The cult was well connected in Neverwinter prior to the cataclysm in 1451 DR and was even better connected as of 1479 DR. In the years prior to Neverwinter's destruction, the Ashmadai worked as agents of Thay although since the cataclysm, the Ashmadai are no longer allied with Szass Tam.

The Ashmadai had the ability to summon devils. However, whenever they summoned a fiend, they bound its essence to the body of a mortal. Because of this the Asmadai kidnapped residents of Neverwinter in order to make them vessels for summoned devils
