Ophala Cheldarstorn is the covert owner of the [[Moonstone Mask]] as well as a respected member of the Many-Starred Cloak. Regarding the Harpers (as well as Elminster of [[Shadowdale]]) as allies, she counts the Arcane Brotherhood of [[Luskan]] among her list of foes. Ophala's apprentices spend most of their time spying on the Brotherhood through magical means so its agents can be stopped. Ophala once had a brief yet dangerous career as an adventurer of other planes, but she has since retired.

## The Laughing Wyrm
During Sammaster's Rage, Ophala took Zundaerazylym -"The Laughing Wyrm" - to the Astral plane in a successful attempt to free her from the madness that was infecting Faerûn's dragons. At the time Zundarazylym was a laundress and seamstress at the [[Moonstone Mask]].
