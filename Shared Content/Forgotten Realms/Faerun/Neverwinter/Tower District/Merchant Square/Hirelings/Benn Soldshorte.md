**BENN SOLDSHORTE**

*Male halfling rogue*

<u>Appearance</u>

Benn Soldshorte is a charismatic little con-artist. He is dashing, quick-witted, and rather charming, more often incognito than not. There are plenty of times when Benn has had the same conversation with a person while under a new alias.

<u>Disguises and Covers</u>

Benn has worn more names and disguises than pairs of trousers in his life time. Depending upon where he travels to, the halfling adopts a new appearance and identity. Some of his favorite aliases are “Veldin Topplebutton,” a well-to-do fishmonger, “Darius Fulgorr,” a liaison to foreign cities, and “Pooky McGuiness,” a snide and short-tempered wizard.

<u>Personality, Quirks, & Memorable Features</u>

- Benn always where the closest exit is, and which boot he has a dagger hidden in. If he has a tell, it’s that he’s prone to tapping his foot right before he makes for a get away.
- Benn has made is life taking what he can, usually by grifting unsuspecting marks, picking pockets in a busy street, or lifting curious valuables whose owners lacked the foresight to nail to the floor.
- Benn has a smile that could melt a frozen heart, and a natural way about him that cause people to like him.
- While he’s perfectly accustomed to his handful of aliases, Benn loves making puns and finds himself in this habit regardless of which identity he’s assuming.
