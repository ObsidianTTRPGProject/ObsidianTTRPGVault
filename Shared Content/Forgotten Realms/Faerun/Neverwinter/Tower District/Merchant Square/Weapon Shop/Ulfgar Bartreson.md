Ulfgar Bartreson

Virile Blacksmith

*“Of course I can fix it. The blow might have killed the man wearing this, but there’s nothing I can’t repair.”*

**Appearance:** Strong and muscled from working the bellows and hammer, Ulfgar keeps his head shaved but leaves his singed beard intact; it keeps itself short if he gets the fire high enough.

**Roleplaying:** He fears nothing and never backs down from a challenge. There is little that Ulfgar feels can hurt him, and there are few he feels that can out-drink him.

**Personality:** Ulfgar is as strong and tough as the metal he bends. If there is a softer side, it has been tempered away.

**Motivation:** He possesses an alpha male personality and tries to prove his superiority in any way he can.

**Background:** Ulfgar was smaller than most of the boys in his part of the city. He was always being picked on. Then his growth spurt came early and he gained strength and toughness that the other boys wouldn’t get for a few more years. Teaching the other boys a lesson they wouldn’t soon forget, Ulfgar set himself out as the leader of the pack. When his father died of pneumonia, Ulfgar had to find work to support his mother. Apprenticed to a local smithy, he put his muscles to good use and bulked up even further. Ulfgar is fairly gruff when dealing with customers, only becoming friendly once he’s determined the worth of the other person.

**Traits:** *(JA) Business, laborer, merchant*
