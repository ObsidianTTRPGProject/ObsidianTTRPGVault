Mysterioso

Illusionary Enigma

*“Not everything is as it seems!”*

**Appearance:** A smoky cloud reveals a nondescript figure who twirls a flowing purple cloak about himself.

**Roleplaying:** He is confident and larger-than-life, giving evasive answers and misdirection. He speaks with his hands, twirling them on occasion to underscore his statements. Mysterioso is rarely directly interacted with.

**Personality:** Mysterioso is gregarious and fun but with a honed edge from being so secretive and hunted. Wealth is simply a material gain easily lost—or easily stolen again.

**Motivation:** The acquisition of wealth is his primary desire, which he does by creating the legend of the Mysterioso persona. It isn’t petty thievery when it’s done with such style and guile!

**Background:** His real name is unknown, but the man who calls himself Mysterioso has a great many secrets still to unveil. The first of which is that his “magic” is anything but; he previously studied arcane magic but could not master its properties. Instead, Mysterioso is a master of illusion and, in a world so readily surrounded by “real” magic, his tricks are easily believed. Explosive powder, misdirection, doubles, and mirrors all give the illusion that Mysterioso commands true power. He has two confidants who, under penalty of death, assist with his illusions and occasionally stand in. Thus Mysterioso can be everywhere and anyone. All of this leaves the authorities confused and desperate for assistance in catching the escape artist. His plots are multilayered and his thefts are works of art.

**Traits:** *(DM) Criminal, magical, power hungry*
