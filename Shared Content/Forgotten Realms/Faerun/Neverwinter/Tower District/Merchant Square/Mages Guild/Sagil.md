Sagil

Insane Cleric

*“I merely wish to know what lies beyond reality, even if that means destroying everything.”*

**Appearance:** He wears traditional dark purple robes topped with a cobra-shaped helmet. His expression fluctuates between anger and insane curiosity.

**Roleplaying:** Sagil’s insanity is easily visible, but he is still able to influence his minions and keep them in line.

**Personality:** His mind writhes and fluctuates as he tries to make sense of the incomprehensible things he has seen. He can flip from calm and curious to irate and violent in a moment.

**Motivation:** He seeks to tear down the walls of reality and see what lies beyond it.

**Background:** Once a high-ranking cleric of a benevolent and kind deity, Sagil got a glimpse beyond the walls of ordered reality; the things he saw drove him mad. Sagil began to worship a new god, a snake being who gave him great power. He has set about on a new holy mission—to see beyond the walls again, no matter what the cost. He believes that the only way to see beyond reality is to destroy it. He sends his minions out to capture relics of power that will let him do this. Sagil spreads his insanity to his minions, giving them just enough of his madness to believe in him but still be effective in their roles. Encounters with Sagil might lead to him using his power to convert or corrupt a weak-willed PC.

**Traits:** *(JA) Eccentric, leader, occult, power hungry, religious*
