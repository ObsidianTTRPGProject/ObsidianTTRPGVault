Hardy Harr

Jesting Puppet Master

*“Stop me if you’re heard this one. The captain of the guard comes home and finds his wife in bed with the baker...”*

**Appearance:** Hardy is gaunt with greasy blond hair that peeks out from underneath a cap. He wears a flashy jacket with dozens of pockets stuffed with various novelties.

**Roleplaying:** Quick with a tasteless joke or bawdy story, Hardy is constantly “on.” He’s sleazy and loud, and more popular than he is funny.

**Personality:** He is magnetic and energetic, and, despite his crude humor, he easily works his way into the confidences of those he entertains.

**Motivation:** Hardy desires nothing more than to be the voice behind a serious power.

**Background:** His popularity has been steadily rising for some time. Now he’s constantly in demand, and has the ear of quite a few minor politicians, nobles, and merchant princes. As he gains the trust of greater numbers of influential people, Hardy sets himself up as a secret and trusted advisor. He revels in acting as a puppet master, playing those who trust him against one another for his own benefit. Hardy has begun to set his master plan into motion, aiming his advisees against those he perceives as a threat and keeping an eye out for greater opportunities.

**Traits:** *(MN) Charming, counselor, eccentric, entertainment, famous, focal, humorous, power hungry, wealthy*
