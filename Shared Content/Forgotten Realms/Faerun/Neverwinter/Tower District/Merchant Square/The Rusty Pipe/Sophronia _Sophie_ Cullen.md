Sophronia "Sophie" Cullen

Downtrodden Prostitute

*“Get out while you can. This place steals your joy, one day at a time.”*

**Appearance:** The smile she offers to customers is a mask. Her heavy-lidded eyes are dark-rimmed and sad. Her hair is tousled. Even wearing the fine lingerie of an upscale escort, her lean figure appears worn out and weary.

**Roleplaying:** She wastes her days, losing them to intoxication or self-destructive pursuits, and then resigns herself to nights spent whoring.

**Personality:** Sophie regrets many decisions in her life and yearns for a way to change it, but sees no way to do it. She hovers just above true desperation, not quite reaching bottom or the impetus needed to start over. Filled with guilt over the life she might have led, she now despairs of ever changing her lot.

**Motivation:** Every day is a struggle to survive bouts of depression and anguished despair.

**Background:** Sophie was once the toast of the capital city, a courtesan who entertained the powerful and wealthy. Her trust was repeatedly betrayed by false promises. Then, she fell victim to thieves who took her expensive gifts. The thing that grieves her most, however, is her own poor judgment. She had a son, but was unable to provide for him after those misfortunes. Not seeing a way out, she delivered the infant to the orphanage, and then left for this dreary town, joining a bawdy house in its red-lantern district.

**Traits:** *(TT) Criminal, entertainment*
