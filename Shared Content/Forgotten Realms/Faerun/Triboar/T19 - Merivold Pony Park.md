# T19 - Merivold Pony Park
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

North of the Evermoor Way, a quaint [[C - Cottage|cottage]] stands near a brightly painted barn topped with a pony-shaped weather vane. A white picket fence encloses a small field behind the barn. Set among flowers on the front lawn is a sign that reads "Merivold Pony Park." Two spinster-sisters named Janna and Leera Merivold (LN female Illuskan human **commoners**) raise and train ponies here, including riding ponies for halflings. At any given time, the Merivolds have `dice: 2d4` ponies for sale.
