# T14 - Six Windows
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

This chilly, creaking, decrepit wooden rooming house is run by Tolmara Hysstryn (CN female Illuskan human **commoner**), a deranged middle-aged woman. V isitors unable to secure rooms at [[T20 - Everwyvern House|Everwyvern House]] or [[T10 - Northshield House|Northshield House]] might be forced to bunk here, but they rarely stay longer than a night because they quickly discover that Tolmara isn't shy about spying on them through keyholes and listening at doors while chuckling to herself.

Locked in the Six Windows' attic are the bones of Tolmara's dead husband, Mirak, of whom she rarely speaks. Tolmara hides the key to the attic door in her brassiere. The lock can be picked with thieves' tools and a DC 10 Dexterity check. If Mirak's bones are touched, his **skeleton** animates for ld4 rounds, after which it clatters to the floor. The effect repeats if the bones are touched again, unless the skeleton is reduced to O hit points or the bones are destroyed, in which case they can't animate. The skeleton is unarmed and deals 1 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

Any character who casts a speak with dead spell on Mirak's skull and asks Mirak's spirit how he died learns that Tolmara drugged him and sealed him in a barrel with a poisonous snake, which killed him with ns bite. Mirak has no clue why Tolmara killed him, and Tolmara is too addled to remember the incident or the circumstances leading up to it. Casting a greater restoration spell on Tolmara restores her sanity, whereupon she confesses to murdering her husband for being anfaithful.

If the characters report Tolmara's crime to Darathra Shendrel, the lord protector has Tolmara arrested and imprisoned pending a trial. Darathra also notifies Mir􀆽ak's two brothers, who work on a nearby ranch. For years, they were led to believe that Mirak had left [[G6 - Town|town]] with another woman; they are grateful to the characters for unearthing the truth and offer them a +1 longbow (a family heirloom) as a reward.
