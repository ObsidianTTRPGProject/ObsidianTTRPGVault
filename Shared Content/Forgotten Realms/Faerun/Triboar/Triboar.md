# Triboar
## Overview
Triboar is on the junction of the Long Road and [[Evermoor Way]], due west of Yartar, its traditional rival. It is a large [[G6 - Town|town]] with a population of around 2500. Over the centuries it has been the assembly point for human armies in response to the orc hordes from the mountains in the north along the Surbrin. Its name is thought to reflect a traveler's tale of killing three boars on the same day. The lord protector's banner consists of three black boars on a red background.

**Militia**

The [[G6 - Town|town]] operates a defense force called "The Twelve" which consists of this many mounted patrols that rotate in a tenday cycle. If necessary, the [[G6 - Town|town]] can rally together a well-armed militia of fifty rapidly and three hundred in a day.

** Goods and services**

Mountain ponies and other horses are for sale in the [[G6 - Town|town]], as well as harnesses and wagons. Guides are available for destinations anywhere in the North for 7 gold pieces per day (excluding food) although they require a deposit of eleven days' pay. The guides all carry rings of teleportation or a similar device in earring or belt form in order to make a quick getaway in the case of treachery, something they are all extremely wary of, and might even refuse getting into situations where this might be a possibility. A lot of the guides are ex-adventurers.

**[[T24 - Gwaeron's Slumber|Gwaeron's Slumber]]**: Triboar is said to be the resting place of a god named Gwaeron Windstrom, the Tracker Who Never Goes Astray. He's said to sleep in this stand of trees just west of [[G6 - Town|town]]. Rangers who venerate Mielikki often visit [[T24 - Gwaeron's Slumber|Gwaeron's Slumber]] to pray, but there's no shrine here. It's said that worshipers of Mielikki who sleep in this wood receive hints in their dreams of what the goddess wants them to do. If the worshiper isn't a ranger, the person gains a once-in-a-lifetime, day-long ability to track as a ranger does. To avoid angering Gwaeron, laws in Triboar forbid cutting any trees, and hunting in the woods. The local militia patrols the grove to prevent orcs, trolls, and other such creatures from camping there - but less intelligent monsters have never been seen in [[T24 - Gwaeron's Slumber|Gwaeron’s Slumber]].

** Rivalry with Yartar**

Although the rivalry between Triboar and the neighboring Yartar is usually friendly, there have been occasions when it has erupted into violence over a particular incident.
