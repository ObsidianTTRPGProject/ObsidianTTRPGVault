# T15 - Boar's Rest
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

Built on a ridge that overlooks the rest of [[G6 - Town|town]], Boar's Rest is the stone mansion of a rich, retired adventurer aamed Hyuth Kolstaag ( NE male Damaran human mage). Ever since Kolstaag had the place built and 1110ved in five years ago, his unbridled arrogance and sense of self-importance have won him no friends in -:'n'boar. Moreover, he has been targeted by so many enemies and rivals that other townsfolk consider him a magnet for disaster. He lives surrounded by trophies of bis past adventures, and rarely emerges from his estate. He never condescends to protect the [[G6 - Town|town]] or use his wealth to aid the less fortunate.

A few weeks ago, a trio of assassins slipped into [[G6 - Town|town]] one night and tried to slay the mage in his sleep. The rest of [[Triboar]] was awakened by peals of thunder and blasts of lightning coming from Kolstaag's estate, and lhough the assassins survived, they were forced to steal borses from [[T8 - The Cart and Coin|the Cart and Coin]] (area [[T8 - The Cart and Coin|T8]]) and murder a stablehand to make good their escape. Kolstaag never offered to reimburse the Widdens family for their loss and never admitted any responsibility for the event.

Since the latest attack on his person, Kolstaag has enlisted four gargoyles to perch on the corners of his rooftop and serve as living sentries. To alleviate their oredom, the malevolent gargoyles swoop down on IDWnsfolk from time to time and terrify them for the sake of amusement, which has led to some tense meetings between the lord protector and the wizard of Boar's Rest, who doesn't see the harm.

**Treasure**. Kolstaag hides his valuables with the aid of Leomund's secret chest spell. He keeps the tiny replica needed to recall the chest on his person, or on a nearby aightstand while he sleeps. Only Kolstaag can use the replica to recall the chest, which he does before entering combat to gain access to the magic items within. If he's captured, he can be persuaded to recall the chest in exdlange for a promise of freedom. The extradimensional chest contains six 500 gp gems, Kolstaag's bracers of defense, and a +1 wand of the war mage.
