# T23 - Apothecary
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

Across the road from [[T10 - Northshield House|Northshield House]] (area TlO) is the [[G6 - Town|town]] apothecary, a slouched wooden [[C - Cottage|cottage]] with ivy-covered walls. Tarmock Felaskur (CN male Illuskan human **commoner**) sells herbal medicines and salves of questionable efficacy. Parked outside the apothecary's front door is a ramshackle wheelbarrow, hanging above which is a wooden sign shaped like a potion bottle. In addition to herbs and salves, Tarmock sells "sweet water" for 1 gp a flask. The sweet, naturally carbonated water bubbles up from a tiny spring in the shed behind Tarmock's [[C - Cottage|cottage]]. Tarmock makes most of his money selling the water to the proprietors of [[T21 - The Pleasing Platter|The Pleasing Platter]].
