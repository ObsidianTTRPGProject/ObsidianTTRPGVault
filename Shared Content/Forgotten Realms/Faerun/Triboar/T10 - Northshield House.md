# T10 - Northshield House
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

Northshield House is a fine local inn-stately, clean, and quiet. The proprietor, **Urgala Meltimer** (see appendix D), is a retired adventurer who bought the inn from the Phorndyl family a little over ten years ago, after her wife (a wizard) vanished in [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]] on an expedition. She much prefers retirement and warns armed guests to keep their blades sheathed during their stay. Urgala has three **mastiffs** (hunting dogs) that sleep in the ground floor common room, and she employs a staff of six loyal, well-paid commoners (LG males and females of various races and ethnicities). Guests sleep in private rooms on the upper floor.
