# Tilverton Scar
*This article is about Tilverton post 1372 DR. For The town of Tilverton pre 1372, see Tilverton.*

The Tilverton Scar is all that is left after the town of Tilverton was attacked by the forces of Thultanthar on Mirtul 27 1372 DR. As of 1479 DR, the Tilverton Scar is the only known area of [[plagueland]] in Cormyr.

## Surrounding Land
A number of homes, most of them belonging to hardy herders and horse ranchers who refuse to be scared away, can be found around the former city's site.

By 1479 DR a small keep had been erected within a few hundred yards of the pocket of [[plagueland]]. The curious could use this keep to examine the [[plagueland]] with some safety. Those who ventured too close were sometimes marked with a spellscar or worse.

## History
### Destruction of Tilverton
On Mirtul 27 1372 DR, Tilverton was destroyed  when it was attacked by the forces of Thultanthar. All that was left of the town was a dark, concave space filled with shadows and flitting regions of deeper darkness. Though Tilverton is now destroyed and desolate, the city's walls rise high above the flat plain on which it once stood.

By 1479 DR, Tilverton had changed from shadows to a “spiral of endless darkness and blue fire”, said by some to be inhabited by something. Legends call this thing the [[Shadow Shredder]] and even the Shadovar stay away.
