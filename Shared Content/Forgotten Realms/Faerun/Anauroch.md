# Anauroch
## Overview
This once-verdant land is now a desert. Northernmost Anauroch is a cold land of frost-rimed rock and the black glacier known as the High Ice. Farther south lies the waterless Plain of Standing Stones, where winds scour jagged rocks amid a sea of gravel. Anauroch's most southerly part is the Sword-a hot, sandy desert. Use the Desert Monsters table in appendix B of the Dungeon Master's Guide to inspire encounter ideas.
