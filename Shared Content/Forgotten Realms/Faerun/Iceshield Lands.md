# Iceshield Lands
## Overview
Where a branch of the [[Dessarin Valley]] meets the western [[High Forest]] are rolling grass-covered hills recently claimed by the orcs of the Iceshield tribe. They dwell in crude lodges made from timber cut from the forest. Elves and centaurs regularly emerge from the [[High Forest]] to attack and set fire to these lodges, but the ores keep cutting down trees and rebuilding them.
