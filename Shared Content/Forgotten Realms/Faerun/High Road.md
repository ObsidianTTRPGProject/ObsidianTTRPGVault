# High Road
## Overview
This well-traveled highway follows the coast from [[Luskan]] to [[Waterdeep]], connecting with Neverwinter along the way. For years, the stretch of the High Road between Neverwinter and [[Waterdeep]] fell into disuse and disrepair because of frequent monster attacks. When he was both the Lord Protector of Neverwinter and the Open Lord ofWaterdeep, Lord [[Lord - Dagult Neverember|Dagult Neverember]] hired adventurers to make the old road safe and spent considerable coin to repair it. Many now consider the High Road a safer means of travel than a sea voyage.
