# Zelbross

## Overview

Halfway between [[Secomber]] and [[Loudwater]], on the old [[Delimbiyr Road]], are the charred wooden remains and the crumbled stone chimney of an inn that was burned down by brigands many years ago. A scorched wooden sign cut in the shape of a fox's head still hangs above a blackened doorframe, with the inn's name-the Sly Fox-all but obliterated by fire. An overgrown dirt road branches southward from the inn.

Characters who follow the dirt road discover the razed ruins of a farming village on the north shore of the Delimbiyr River. Only some rickety wooden docks remain to mark what used to be the village of Zelbross. The abandoned site has a lovely view of the [[Southwood]] across the river, so it's easy to imagine why settlers chose this spot, but there's no evidence of what became of the villagers or whatever attacked them. Zelbross has been abandoned for more than ten years.

## Suggested Encounter

If the characters search the ruins of the Sly Fox, they encounter a runaway child from the Blue Bear tribe (see the "Uthgardt Barbarians" section earlier in this chapter). He is hiding in the inn's hearth, and characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher spot him as they search the ruin. Orok is a nine-year-old human boy armed with a rusty dagger and a homemade sling. He is covered head to toe with soot and grime, and he has sticks woven into his flea-ridden mane of black hair. He is smart enough not to attack well-armed adventurers but has no qualms about trying to harm anyone who antagonizes him. Orok has the statistics of a kobold, with the following changes:

- Orok is chaotic neutral.

- He doesn't have darkvision.

- He speaks Bothii (the Uthgardt language) and broken Common.

- He lacks the kobold's sunlight sensitivity feature ( but retains the pack tactics feature).

Orok's siblings bullied him mercilessly, so he ran away from his tribe. Although he's clearly an Uthgardt child, he carries nothing that identifies him as a member of the Blue Bear tribe, nor does he disclose his tribal affiliation for fear of being delivered back to the tribe. If the characters offer Orok food, he takes it and scuttles back to his "den" to devour it. He also retreats to the hearth if he sees any magic. Like most Uthgardt, he is fearful of magic and distrustful of spellcasters.

Orok is drawn to rough-looking wilderness types, such as barbarians and rangers. If such a character is friendly toward him, he bonds with that character and becomes that character's follower. Orok doesn't willingly accompany the party otherwise, preferring to remain in his lair and live by catching fish in the nearby river.
