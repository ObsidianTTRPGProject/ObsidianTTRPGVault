# Surbrin Trail
## Overview
A trail extends north from the city ofYartar, through farmland patrolled by Yartarran soldiers on horseback. Once the Surbrin Trail reaches the hills on the other side of the [[Dessarin Valley]], the farms peter out, along with the patrols, and the trail hugs the eastern shore of the Surbrin River as though shying away from the [[Evermoors]]. At the north end of the trail, beyond [[Mornbryn's Shield]], is [[Nesme]].
