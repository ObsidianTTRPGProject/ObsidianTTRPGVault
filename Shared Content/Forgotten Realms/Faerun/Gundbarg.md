# Gundbarg
## Overview
A city of dour Northfolk, Gundbarg tolerates visitors only because it depends on trade for its survival. What the Northfolk can't buy, they plunder. Visitors typically stay at the Dragon Turtle Inn, a salt-encrusted stone edifice near the docks. High rock walls enclose Gundbarg's harbor, which contains the King's Fleet, consisting of nearly two hundred longships.
