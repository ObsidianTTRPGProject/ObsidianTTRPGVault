# Delimbiyr Vale
## Overview
Delimbiyr Vale is the seemingly endless valley through which the Delimbiyr River flows. It begins at the foothills of the [[Nether Mountains]] and stretches southwest for hundreds of miles toward the sea. The least settled part of the valley stands between the [[High Forest]] and the [[Graypeak Mountains]]. As the valley sweeps south of the great forest, more and more settlements begin to appear along the river. The largest settlement along the vale is [[Daggerford]], near the coast, but even that is but a [[G6 - Town|town]]. With its easy access to water and ample resources, the Delimbiyr Vale seems ripe for settlers-but the valley's resources also attract monsters from the nearby forests, hills, and mountains.
