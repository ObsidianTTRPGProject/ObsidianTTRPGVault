# Eveningstar
Eveningstar was a small unwalled farming town of about fifty buildings in Cormyr.

## Geography
It was located roughly 30 miles (48,000 meters) west of Arabel, where the [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/High Road|High Road]] crossed the Starwater River.

Eveningstar was a pastoral village surrounded by fields and orchards situated in an elbow of the Starwater River just north of the King's Forest in Cormyr. It stood at the intersection of the High Road, which ran west to [[High Horn]] and east to [[Arabel]], and the Starwater Road (known by locals as the "Suzail Road" or "Southrun"), which ran south to the village of Dhedluk in the King's Forest (known by locals as the "Shadowood"). Immediately to the north of Eveningstar was the Eveningstar Gorge or the Starwater Gorge. The gorge, formed by the Starwater River as it flowed down from the Storm Horn Mountains, provided relatively easy access to the Helmlands and the Storm Horns and was the only significant break in the limestone Stonecliff that ran from Tyrluk to the west to just short of [[Arabel]].

## Economy
Eveningstar was an agricultural community producing primary products such as milk, eggs, poultry, mutton, carrots, beans, and parsnips, as well as value-added goods such as cheese, [[parchment]], wool, and wine; all of which were sold at a weekly farmers' market. Eveningstar was also a popular stopover for frequent overland caravans, who patronized the local farmers and businesses. The most important business in town was the Lonesome Tankard tavern and inn, famous in Cormyr as one of the best places to eat, drink, and stay the night.[5] As of 1368 DR, the town exported commodities such as parchment, wine and wool to Daerlun in Sembia.

## History
In 1368 DR, Eveningstar, along with Espar, Tyrluk, and Waymoot, was plagued by rogue dragons.

Like most of the settlements in this region, it suffered badly in the Goblin War of 1370 DR.

## Notable Locations
- Lonesome Tankard (Duman Kiriag, human, NG)
- Golden Unicorn (Selda Imyara)
- Welcoming Hand, an inn destroyed during the Goblin War and rebuilt quite quickly after.
- House of the Morning, the large temple to Lathander that added to the Eveningstar's importance in the region (Jelde Asturien of Lathander, NH).
