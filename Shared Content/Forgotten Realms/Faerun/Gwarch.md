# Gwarch
A goblin trading post built within the walls of an ancient hobgoblin keep on a small mound of earth in the center of a lake, Gwarch is an anomaly in the Stonelands. It is one of the few places where goblins interact peacefully with humans, halflings, and other civilized races. Over the years, the trading post has grown and expanded to include a number of market stalls and trading posts built on floating barges within the lake. While some of these are tied to shore, many others float freely and jostle with other barges for better positions throughout the day. The post is as chaotic as one might expect a trading post for goblins to be, but due to the large number of surrounding dungeons and ancient keeps, it is always well stocked with worthwhile supplies and odd artifacts and attracts a fair number of adventuring companies and explorers who intend to plunder the Stonelands.
