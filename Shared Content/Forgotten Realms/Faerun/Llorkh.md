# Llorkh
## Overview
Human and dwarf prospectors founded the mining [[G6 - Town|town]] of Llorkh on the eastern shore of the Grayflow River. When the Zhents first began running trade along the [[Black Road]] through [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], they conquered Llorkh, using it as a foothold in the North. The Zhentarim also laid claim to the gold and silver mines in the nearby hills and utterly depleted them, all the while fighting off [[Grayvale]] militias attempting to recapture the [[G6 - Town|town]].

After the mines were tapped out, the Zhents packed up and left the [[G6 - Town|town]] in ruins. Llorkh later became a bandit lord's stronghold until that villain was finally dispatched. Most recently, an attempt to rebuild Llorkh had just gotten under way when the stone giants of [[Deadstone Cleft]] attacked. The residents were driven out, and the giants have begun dismantling the [[G6 - Town|town]] stone by stone in an effort to erase it from the surface world.

## Suggested Encounter
Six stone giants are combing through the ruins of Llorkh, separating rocks, tombstones, clay roof tiles, and other bits of stonework from blackened timbers, smashed furnishings, wood-and-iron tools, and other detritus. They toss the stone and clay into the river while burying the other wreckage under earth. The giants hurl rocks and tombstones at any "small folk" they see. The giants are spread out such that the characters can fight them in three groups, each group consisting of two stone giants. The adventurers can also keep their distance and leave the giants alone.

## Treasure
Each stone giant carries a sack containing ld6 x 100 gp in mixed coinage, ld6 100 gp gemstones, and one mundane item, determined by rolling on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction.
