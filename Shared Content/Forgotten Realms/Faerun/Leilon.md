# Leilon
## Overview
Leilon was a small [[G6 - Town|town]] near the [[High Road]], straddling the distance between mines in the mountains and the mudflats on the coast from which its people would send out barges of ore to waiting ships. For many years, the [[G6 - Town|town]] stood abandoned because the protective magic around a wizard's tower called the House of Thalivar went awry, causing any who looked at it to be paralyzed. The few travelers still taking the [[High Road]] and braving the expansion of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] had to travel for miles around Leilon or pass by it at night to avoid the tower's mysterious power. When Lord Neverember decided to reopen the [[High Road]] to travel, tearing down the tower became a top priority. It is now safe to pass through Leilon, and it is once again a working [[G6 - Town|town]], but all who live there owe allegiance to Lord Neverember.
