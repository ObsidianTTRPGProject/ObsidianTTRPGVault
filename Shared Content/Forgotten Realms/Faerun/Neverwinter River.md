# Neverwinter River
## Overview
Theme Music

[[Neverwinter]] River was a river whose bright waters ran warm throughout the year. Keeping the city of [[Neverwinter]] warm, it was the river that prevented it from freezing during the winter.

When Mount Hotenow erupted, dark ash choked the river for months before it was able to flow properly.

Three bridges once spanned the river in [[Neverwinter]]: the Sleeping Dragon, the Winged Wyvern and the Dolphin. Following the eruption, only the Winged Wyvern remained.

## Obstacles
**Breakdown**: When this is rolled, the boat springs a leak. A DC 15 Knowledge check can be made each hour to plug the hole. For every failure the boat takes on 1 foot of water. The boat can with-stand 5 feet of water before it starts to sink.

**Fog:** A thick soupy fog rolls in and remains for `dice: 2d8` hours, reducing visibility to 5 feet with total concealment beyond that. The captain brings the boat to a halt, refusing to continue forward in the fog. Roll for an additional encounter once during this time.

**Portage/Sandbank** (50% chance of each)**:** At a portage, the river has become shallow enough that the sternwheeler must be stopped and the boat be treated as a portage.

**Sleeping Sickness:** A random crew member or PC is exposed to sleeping sickness from an insect bite and suffers 1 point of exhaustion. A healing spell and 24 hours rest is required to cure Sleeping Sickness.

**Snag:** Like a sandbank, a DC 20 Spot check by the pilot or a forward spotter allows this submerged log to be avoided. Otherwise the boat strikes it and is stopped. Anyone within 5 feet of an edge must make a DC 15 Balance check or fall overboard. It requires `dice: 1d2` hours to repair the damage and bail out any water. Roll for an additional encounter, ignoring any that are not water based.

**Sound:** A strange sound carries out of the impenetrable jungle or across the rolling plain, such as a terrifying roar, mournful humanlike wail, the rushing of mighty waters, the crashing of trees as something gargantuan passes nearby, or distant drumming. It continues for as little as a few seconds to as long as several hours. Exploration discovers no source for the sound but does call for another encounter roll.
