# Elminster's Tower
Elminster's tower was the abode of perhaps the most famous, or infamous, spellcaster throughout Toril—Elminster Aumar.

## Location
Elminster's tower was found in the village of [[Shadowdale]]. It sat just south of the Old Skull near a small pond.

## Structure
The tower stood only three stories tall. Kudzu vines covered nearly every one of the field stones used to form the structure. Numerous lean-tos and shacks had been added to the exterior to accommodate Elminster's growing collection of items both magical and mundane. The front of the tower was adorned with a simple wooden door.

## Interior
The first floor of the tower held a simple kitchen and office. A spiral staircase led to the second floor, which held Elminster's personal quarters. An even smaller room was located on the third floor and was sometimes used as a work room for guests.

## Defenses
Though no one knew the extent of magical protection placed about the tower, it was wise to assume that Elminster's home was safe from unwanted intrusion.

## History
Elminster built the squat tower sometime during the mid–9th century DR.

## Inhabitants
In addition to the mighty mage, Elminster's scribe and personal assistant, Lhaeo, was the only other nearly permanent resident. Elminster did, however, entertain visitors from time to time.

Narm Tamaraith and Shandril sheltered at the tower after surviving an attack in the Tower of Ashaba.
