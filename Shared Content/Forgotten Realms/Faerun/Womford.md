# Womford
## Overview
A tiny village along the [[Iron Road]] was known as Ironford until shortly after a dragon was slain nearby. Passersby began to call the settlement Wyrm Ford-a name subsequently corrupted, thanks to the thick local accent, into Womford. The village has a dock on the Dessarin River for shipping grain from its gristmill. It's also the market and the source of supplies for the surrounding farms from which the grain comes. Aside from the mill, the village has a handful of granaries and a larger handful of cottages, several of which house tiny shops. West of the village is the Ironford Bridge, a long, narrow, ramshackle wooden bridge that spans the Dessarin River and leads to [[Bargewright Inn]], which looms atop a hill.

Womforders lock and bar their doors and shutter their windows at night, for fear of the so-called Womford Bat, a nocturnal predator that snatches folk it can catch outside after dark; see the "[[Bargewright Inn]]" section for more information on this creature.
