# Edermath Orchard
## Overview
[[Daran Edermath]] is a retired adventurer who lives in a tidy little [[C - Cottage|cottage]] beside an [[G16 - Apple Orchard|apple orchard]]. A fit, silverhaired half-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast , far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the [[Neverwinter]] region, his original home.

Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evil doers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around [[Phandalin]]. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.
