# Shrine of Luck
## Overview
[[Phandalin]]'s only temple is a small shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, goddess of luck and good fortune.

The shrine is in the care of a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a zealous young elf who despairs of ever ridding [[Phandalin]] of the Redbrands. Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too strong. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around [[Phandalin]].
