# Spoils Alley (Alley)
## Overview
A behind-the-shops way running westerly from the southernmost end of [[Quill Alley (Alley)|Quill Alley]], this innocentlooking passage is where the Thieves Guild of old used to divide up the street takings of a nights work. Now its a boxlittered backwaterbut it still used for shady meetings. Its an especially good place to change clothing or don a disguise.
