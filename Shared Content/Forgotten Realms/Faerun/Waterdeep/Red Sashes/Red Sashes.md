# Red Sashes
## Overview
The Red Sashes are a vigilante group active in Waterdeep's poorer neighborhoods, particularly Dock Ward. Answering only to "the One" ([Durnan](http://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/organizations/waterdeep5.shtml#Durnan)), the Red Sashes excel at intrigue, hiding people, and finding people who do not want to be found. The Red Sashes appear to work against the Lords of Waterdeep, but in truth, they often end up serving the Lords indirectly.

Unlike most vigilantes, the Red Sashes do not act impetuously or excessively. They keep a close eye on Waterdeep's seamy underbelly, carefully observing the abused and their abusers. If the Watch seems inclined to step in and actually serve the cause of justice, then the Red Sashes remain in the shadows. However, if the Watch pursues an innocent person, the Red Sashes might surreptitiously assist his escape. Likewise, if the Watch seems disinclined to pursue someone who has committed a crime, the Red Sashes might apprehend the wrongdoer and deposit him on the Palace steps. Such public captures both embarrass the Watch and draw public attention to the case.

The Red Sashes are organized into cells, one per ward, each answerable only to "the One." The Castle, Trades, and Dock Ward cells are the strongest and most active. Most Red Sashes only know the identities of their fellow cell members, meaning that the arrest of the few cannot unravel the whole organization. Coordination among the various cells is rare or nonexistent, and sometimes multiple cells have pursued the same individual. As "the One" seems capable of eluding all detection, magical or otherwise, the unmasking of a single cell leader has not yet led to another cell being penetrated. Among the Lords of Waterdeep, only Khelben, Kitten, Mirt, Nindil, and Sammereza are aware of [[Durnan]]'s involvement with the Red Sashes. The more practical Lords keep this information away from the paladins of the group, who would never approve of the group's methods. Laeral Silverhand Arunsun and the Unseen are among the few others who know [[Durnan]]'s secret.

Many members of the group take the [vigilante prestige class](http://www.realmshelps.net/charbuild/classes/prestige/Vigilante).
