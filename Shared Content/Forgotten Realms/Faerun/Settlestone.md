# Settlestone
## Overview
Settlestone, also known as Dwarvendarrow and The Ruin was a village outside of [[Mithral Hall]]. It was first inhabited by dwarves, fell into ruins, then was resettled in 1358 DR by the barbarians of [[Icewind Dale]] under the leadership of Berkthgar in alliance with [[Mithral Hall]].

## Geography
The village of Settlestone was located in the southern spurs of the [[Spine of the World]] near the headwaters of the Surbrin within the mountain known as Fourthpeak. It was a cold and windy place with mountains surrounding it on three sides.

## Points of Interest
**Hengorot**
Hengorot, or Mead Hall, was a meeting place in Settlestone for barbarians of the Elk tribe.

The stone building was huge and could house over 800 inhabitants. Only half of Hengorot was crafted from stone; the rest had deerskin canopies. In the center of the massive structure was a long table for eating and drinking mead.

Like Settlestone itself, Mead Hall was a place where women and children were servants catering to the village's male population by serving drinks and cooking food. Women were allowed to sit at the huge table, but only in the laps of the drinking barbarian men.

Between 1357 DR and 1358 DR, the [[Icewind Dale]] barbarians began building Mead Hall as a permanent structure in Settlestone.

## Background
Hundreds of years before being inhabited by the barbarians of [[Icewind Dale]], Settlestone was called Dwarvendarrow. It was built by Bunko Battlehammer, an ancestor of Bruenor Battlehammer, and his clan. Dwarvendarrow served as a trade post outside [[Mithral Hall]] and it was the only place merchants could trade with the inhabitants of the dwarven city. [[Clan Battlehammer]] did not want strangers to visit their secret caves and mines. In -628 DR, the dwarves of Clan Ironshield fled the kingdom of Andalbruin for the more defensible position of Settlestone. Before being discovered in 1356 DR by the Companions of the Hall, Settlestone was also known as the Ruin.
