# Silverwood
## Overview
Growing atop the rugged, hilly terrain between the [[Evermoors]] and the [[Nether Mountains]], the Silverwood was once part of the [[High Forest]], but over centuries, loggers working the woodlands on either side of the [[Evermoor Way]] have carved a great wound through the terrain. Bare hillsides littered with stumps line this gap.
