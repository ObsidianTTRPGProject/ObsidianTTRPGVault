# Ruins of Thundertree
## Overview
Near the place where the [[Neverwinter River]] emerges from [[Neverwinter Wood]] stands the abandoned village of Thundertree. Once, this was a prosperous community on the outskirts of the forest, wealthy from the work of its woodcutters and trappers. Then thirty years ago, the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] to the north devastated Thundertree. In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.

Though most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms. Few people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long- with two notable exceptions. The **druid** Reidoth (see area 4) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Cultists have also arrived recently (see area 13) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain (see area 7).

As the party approaches the ruins, read the following:

> [!note] Read-Aloud
> Gradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush. Ahead of you, in the middle of the settlement, rises a steep hill, upon which stands a stone tower with a partially collapsed roof and an adjoining [[C - Cottage|cottage]]. A dirt road hugs the base of the hill and wends its way between old stone houses, many of which are roofless ruins with interiors open to the weather. Other buildings appear more or less intact. The whole place is eerily silent.
> 
> A wooden sign is nailed to a post nearby. It reads: "DANGER! Plant monsters AND zombies! Turn back now!"
> 

Reidoth placed the sign to discourage bands of treasure seekers from stirring up the monsters in the area.

## Additional Details
Many of Thundertree's buildings have crumbled in the years since the [[G6 - Town|town]] was abandoned, even as nature threatens to swallow what remains.

**Buildings**. A building in Thundertree is either ruined or intact, as shown on the map.

Ruined buildings are empty shells with stone walls 5 to 8 feet high. Their roofs are gone, leaving piles of debris inside the walls. The debris is difficult terrain (see "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook).

Intact buildings are rundown, ramshackle stone cottages that are otherwise sti ll standing. Their wooden doors are swollen and require a successful DC 10 Strength check to force open. The windows of a ny intact building are 2 feet wide and covered by wooden shutters containing 6-inch wide arrow slits. Creatures on one side of an arrow slit gain three-quarters cover against a ttacks from the other side (see "Cover" in the rulebook). Dusty old furnishings such as simple wooden chairs and tables remain in most intact buildings.

**Trees and Brush**. Trees average 30 to 40 feet tall and provide cover. Brush consists of large bushes that count as difficult terrain.
