# Ironmaster
## Overview
The dwarven city of Iron master is perched at the western edge of [[Icewind Dale]], where the Shaengarne River flows into the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. The city is nestled in a great cleft where the Shaengarne rushes to the sea. Its stone towers rise like spikes from the valley floor, and the rooms and passages of Ironmaster weave in and out of never-melting ice and the stone of the valley walls. Mining tunnels extend from the valley walls far below the tundra, providing the dwarves with an apparently limitless supply of iron.


Ironmaster is populated exclusively by dwarves. Members of other races are forbidden to set foot in Iron-master Vale. Great stone menhirs marked with the city's arms-a red anvil on a gray diamond standing on endare arranged in a perimeter around the vale to warn away travelers who stray too close.
