# G8 - Northfurrow's End
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

Standing north of the [[G6 - Town|town]] is a three-story stone edifice with arched windows that offer a view of the surrounding gardens. Thin plumes of smoke issue from its many chimneys on rainy days and cold nights. Life-size statues of rearing horses flank the double doors that lead to the common room. Above these doors hangs a wooden sign that proclaims the name of this grand establishment, [[Northfurrow]]'s End, in fancy lettering. West of the main building is a stable house that can hold and feed up to fifty horses.

The proprietor of the inn is an elder member of the Fellowship of Innkeepers guild ofWaterdeep and, as such, must operate within the strictures of his guild. His name is Miros Xelbrin (see appendix D), and he's a retired carnival attraction-dubbed "the Yeti" during his heyday because of his barrel-shaped body and the thick, white hair covering his arms, chest, back, and head.

Miros is a staunch supporter of the Emerald Enclave and offers free room and board to members of the organization and their companions. His rooms are spacious and comfortable, his food plentiful and delicious (made with only the freshest ingredients). He has little tolerance for rabble-rousers and can spot adventurers from a mile away. Miros employs a staff of twenty cleaners and servers. He sells a local brand of beer called Golden gulp, though the first flagon to a new customer is always free.

In the back of [[Northfurrow]]'s End is a pottery kiln that Miros uses to make the inn's trademark flagons. These large, varnished clay mugs have sheaves of golden wheat painted on their sides. Miros doesn't sell these minor works of art, but the mugs are occasionally stolen and sold elsewhere.

One of the patrons of [[Northfurrow]]'s End at present is a visitor from Waterdeep. That city's Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors has an agreement with the abbot. Every midwinter, the guild sends one of its members to [[Goldenfields]] as a sign of its commitment to protecting Waterdeep's interests. The wizard serves for one year and acts as a liaison between the city and the abbot, while also aiding in the defense of Golden fields. The guild's current attache is Naxene Drathkala (see appendix D), a quiet and bookish young wom􀃻n who lives in a lavishly furnished suite above the inn's stable house and spends most of her time writing papers on subjects both arcane and esoteric. In addition to being a member of the Watchful Order, Naxene is an agent of the Lords' Alliance and a loyal spy for Lady Laeral Silverhand ofWaterdeep. Miros has tried to court Naxene, but she ignores his halting advances.

Among the other guests of [[Northfurrow]]'s End are numerous actors, musicians, acrobats, and other performers from Waterdeep and [[Daggerford]]. These spirited folk entertain locals during afternoon picnics in the [[G6 - Town|town]] circle (area [[G6 - Town|G6]]). A halfling singer and lute player named Oren Yogilvy (see appendix D) is the only permanent resident of the inn among them. He has a fondness for Goldengulp and gets free room and board for keeping the residents of [[Goldenfields]] entertained. After a few drinks, Oren likes to wander the compound in search of inspiration and often wakes up in a field the morning after.
