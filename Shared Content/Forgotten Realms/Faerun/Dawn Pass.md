# Dawn Pass
## Overview
This stretch of road is the only wagon-friendly route through the [[Graypeak Mountains]]. At dawn, the rising sun shines brightly through the pass, hence its name.

Halfway between [[Llorkh]] and [[Parnast]], just east of the mountains, the Zhentarim have built a stone gatehouse over the road, with cliffs to both sides. Two heavy iron portcullises drop down to trap travelers so that a wellarmed garrison of twenty Zhentarim veterans (N male and female humans of various ethnicities) can extort money from them. Those who pay the toll of 1 gp per head (including the heads of horses, ponies, and mules) are sent on their way. Those who can't pay the toll or refuse to do so are turned back. Characters who can prove that they are members of the Black Network are allowed through without question, along with any traveling companions. While conversing with other members of the Black Network, the guards report seeing stone giants spying on them from a distance, but so far the gatehouse has not been attacked.
