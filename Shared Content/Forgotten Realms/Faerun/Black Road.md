# Black Road
## Overview
Long ago, the Zhentarim built this trade route to connect its established footholds in the east with its lucrative ventures along the Sword Coast. For some time it was lost to the Zhentarim when the Netherese reappeared and reclaimed [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], but with the second fall of Netheril and the magical return of the desert, the Zhentarim have been able to reclaim the route.

The Black Road stretches eastward from the village of [[Parnast]] across [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]'s sandy wasteland for hundreds of miles. Black Network caravans using the road are heavily guarded because of desert bandits.
