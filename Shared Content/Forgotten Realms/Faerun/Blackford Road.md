# Blackford Road
## Overview
This trade trail runs east from [[Luskan]] to Mirabar. The road is named for a little-used ford across the River Mirar that allows travelers to avoid [[Luskan]] should they wish. Caravan masters have many other names for the road, none of them flattering: Auril's Ride, the Stygian Road, 01' Frozenfinger, and the Dead Yeti Highway, to name a few. Where the road spans the Black Raven River, south of [[Raven Rock]], stands a [[Stone Bridge|stone bridge]] with broken statues of rearing horses at each end.
