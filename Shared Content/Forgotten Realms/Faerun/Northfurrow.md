# Northfurrow
## Overview
The Northfurrow extends from Waterdeep fields. Wagons laden with food make their way south under heavy guard to the city, while empty wagons head north to fetch more bounty. The traffic is heaviest after the harvest. Human and halfling cottages and farmsteads have sprung up on both sides of the trail, and the humble rural folk who live here refer to themselves as Northfurrowers.
