## Background
*Tomb of Horrors*

Tomb of Horrors is an [adventure module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)) written by [Gary Gygax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax) for the *[Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons)* (*D&D*) [role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game). It was originally written for and used at the 1975 [Origins 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_Game_Fair)convention. Gygax designed the adventure both to challenge the skill of expert players in his own campaign, and to test players who boasted of having mighty [player characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character) able to best any challenge. The module, coded S1, was the first in the S-series, or *special*[<sup>\[1]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors#cite_note-1) series of modules. Several versions of the adventure have been published, the first in 1978, and the most recent, published for the *D&D* fourth edition, in 2010. It also served as the basis for a novel published in 2002.

## The module's plot revolves around the tomb of the [demi-lich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilich_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)) [Acererak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acererak). The [player characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character) must battle their way past a variety of monsters and traps, with the ultimate goal of destroying Acererak. *Tomb of Horrors* is considered one of the greatest *Dungeons & Dragons* modules of all Time Measurement, as well as one of the most difficult. The module has influenced later*Dungeons & Dragons* products, and was followed by three other (unrelated) modules in the S-series: [S2 *White Plume Mountain*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Plume_Mountain), [S3 *Expedition to the Barrier Peaks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_to_the_Barrier_Peaks), and [S4 *Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Caverns_of_Tsojcanth).

Plot summary*Tomb of Horrors* is set in the *[World of Greyhawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Greyhawk)*, a *D&D* [campaign setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_setting_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)).[<sup>\[2]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors#cite_note-30Years-2) In *Tomb of Horrors*, the adventurers encounter a number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard.[<sup>\[3]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors#cite_note-HW-3) As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard [Acererak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acererak) is said to linger in his ancient tomb in [undead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undead_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)) form. Originally a powerful [lich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lich_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)), he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.

The module is divided into thirty-three encounters, beginning with two false entrances to the tomb, and ending with "The Crypt of Acererak the Demi-Lich". Example encounters are the "Huge Pit Filled with 200 Spikes" (section 20), or encounter 22, "The Cavern of Gold and Silver Mists": "The mists are silvery and shot through with delicate streamers of golden color. Vision extends only 6'. There is a dim aura of good if detected for. Those who step into the mist must save versus poison or become idiots until they can breathe the clean air above ground under the warm sun."[<sup>\[4]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors#cite_note-4) The module ends with the destruction of Acererak, without any postscript.
