# Gauntlgrym
## Overview
Once a great city and a bastion of the empire of Delzoun, this dwarven stronghold stood abandoned for centuries beneath the mountains. Recently, an army of shield dwarves led by Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed it, ousting drow squatters and sending them scurrying back into [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]]. Bruenor now sits on Gauntlgrym's throne as king.

The "heart" of Gauntlgrym is its legendary forge, within which is trapped a fire primordial known as Maegera the Dawn Titan. For more information on Gauntlgrym and its inhabitants, see the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide and the adventure Out of the Abyss.

## Suggested Encounter
Drow of House Xorlarrin infiltrate Gauntlgrym through secret passageways of which not even the dwarves are aware. Bearing an iron flask given to them by the great fire giant chief Duke Zalto, they slip into the forge, murder a few guards, trap the fire primordial in the flask, and try to flee with their prize. If the characters are in Gauntlgrym prior to visiting [[Ironslag]] (see chapter 8, "Forge of the Fire Giants"), they can attempt to thwart the theft and keep the primordial out of Zalto's hands. In this encounter, the characters confront the drow as they try to escape. The encounter begins in one of two ways:

- The characters are making their way down a hallway in Gauntlgrym when they face the drow interlopers.
- The characters are with Bruenor Battlehammer when news of the theft of the primordial reaches the king's ear, in which case the characters are asked to help find those responsible.

In either case, the characters encounter the drow in a dusty, 20-foot-wide, 30-foot-high hall lined with 10-foottall dwarven statues. Assume the two groups are 60 feet apart when they see each other. The dark elves are making their way toward a secret door set into the wall behind one of the statues, beyond which is a 5-foot-wide, 7-foot-high, mile-long tunnel that the drow intend to use as their escape route. The secret door is between the t wo groups-20 feet from the drow party and 40 feet from the adventuring party at the start of the encounter- and the characters have no prior knowledge of it. So masterfully crafted is the secret door that spotting it requires a careful search of the wall and a successful DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check. The drow are already aware of the secret door, having used it to creep into Gauntlgrym undetected.

The leader of the all-male par ty is a slippery, neversay- die dark elf named Draac Xorlarrin. Taal, his younger cousin, accompanies him. Both are drow mages. Their escort consists of six male drow elite warriors and two shadow demons (one summoned by Draac, the other by Taal).

Draac and Taal have both used their Summon Demon ability, as well as all of their 5th-level spell slots. They know that they can't afford to spar with adventurers or risk getting caught. On their first turns in combat, Draac and Taal cast Evard's black tentacles spells. The tentacles erupt from the floor in front of the characters, filling the two 20-foot squares between them and the secret door. Confident that the tentacles will hold their enemies at bay, the drow mages then head toward the secret door and try to escape. The drow elite warriors and the shadow demons follow the mages, serving as personal bodyguards. Once inside the secret tunnel, the mages use web spells to obstruct the passageway behind their party, hoping to ensnare or slow down their pursuers.

## Treasure
Draac Xorlarrin carries the iron flask that has Maegera the Dawn Titan (see appendix C) trapped inside it. He also carries a staff topped with web patterns on the haft and a sculpted obsidian spider with small diamonds for eyes at the top (worth 1,500 gp). The staff is ornate but nonmagical. Taal carries a pouch with four 100 gp gems inside it, and he wears a fine black cloak embroidered with webs made of platinum thread (worth 750 gp).

## Development
If the drow escape, the characters might encounter them again in [[Ironslag]] (see the "Special Delivery" section at the end of chapter 8). Maegera the Dawn Titan can be safely released from the flask in one of two locations. If it is released inside Gauntlgrym's forge, Maegera becomes trapped there once more. If it is released inside the adamantine forge in [[Ironslag]] (see chapter 8, "Forge of the Fire Giants," area 29), the fire primordial is trapped within that forge and likewise contained. If the primordial is released anywhere else, it goes on a rampage, attacking any creature it sees, until it is again trapped inside an iron flask or some other receptacle.
