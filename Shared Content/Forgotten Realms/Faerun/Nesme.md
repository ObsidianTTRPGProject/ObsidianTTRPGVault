# Nesme
## Overview
Despite a heroic effort to save the [[G6 - Town|town]], Nesme fell during the War of the [[Silver Marches]] to a horde of ores aided by an ancient white dragon named Arauthator. It was then conquered by drow until they too were forced to abandon it. Today, Nesme lies in ruins, and monsters from the [[Evermoors]] thwart efforts to rebuild it.

The [[G6 - Town|town]] stood on the east side of the Surbrin River, enclosed within a circular wall festooned with ballistae and catapults, and connected by a fortified bridge to a formidable castle on the west side of the river. This western bastion enclosed the docks, paddocks, and stock pens, and also gave the townsfolk and the militia a place to fall back to in the event the [[G6 - Town|town]] was breached. Although the militia put up a good fight against the orcs, the [[G6 - Town|town]] couldn't withstand the dragon's attacks. The castle on the western shore has partially collapsed, the bridge has been destroyed, and the [[G6 - Town|town]]'s defenses have been torn down. Within the [[G6 - Town|town]] walls, now breached in several places, are piles of debris that were once shops, taverns, inns, and festhalls. Skulls, bones, rusted armor, and broken weapons are all that remain of those killed by ore axes and the dragon's icy breath.

## Suggested Encounter
Eight Zhentarim **thugs** (LE male and female humans of various ethnicities) mounted on **riding horses** are watching the [[Surbrin Trail]]. They intercept characters walking or riding north toward Nesme, threatening to kill them unless they turn back immediately. If the characters defeat or circumvent these guards, they arrive at Nesme to find Zhentarim representatives awaiting the arrival of a female fire giant representing Duke Zalto (see chapter 8, "Forge of the Fire Giants"). Characters can eavesdrop on this event about to unfold by hiding behind some rubble. They must each succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check to go unnoticed.

The Zhentarim force consists of a negotiator named Fylo Nelgorn (LE male Damaran **priest** of Bane with a **flying snake** curled around his left arm) and twenty Zhentarim **thugs** (LE male and female humans of various ethnicities). The Zhents' **riding horses** are tethered to some ruins across [[G6 - Town|town]]. The **fire giant**, Gundahella, and her retinue of twenty **hobgoblins** approach from the north and enter the meeting area through a gash in the outer wall. The negotiation lasts only a few minutes.

Fylo pledges the assistance of the Zhentarim to keep the Lords' Alliance and other groups from interfering in the fire giants' search for the Vonindod fragments, on the condition that the adamantine colossus not be used to attack settlements or parts thereof without the Black Network's consent. Fylo mentions Moongleam Tower in [[Everlund]] as a likely target to illustrate his point.

Gundahella agrees to Fylo's terms and tells him that Duke Zalto is going to release a Zhentarim prisoner currently being held in lronslag as a token of good faith; she doesn't know the Zhent by name, only that he's a dwarf.

If the characters do nothing but observe, the meeting concludes with Gundahella and her force leaving the way they came and Fylo dispatching his flying snake with a scroll to his superiors in [[Yartar]], informing them that the meeting went as well as could be expected. He and his thugs set up camp amid the ruins and wait for the flying snake to return with further instructions.

If the characters interrupt the negotiations, both evil forces attack them. Regardless of the outcome of the conflict, Gundahella is furious that the Zhentarim failed to ensure the safety of the meeting site. She ends the negotiation with no agreement reached.
