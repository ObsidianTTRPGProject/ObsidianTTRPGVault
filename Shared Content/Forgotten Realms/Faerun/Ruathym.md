# Ruathym
## Overview
The barbarians of Ruathym (see map 3.10) are at war with [[Luskan]] and have been for as long as any of them can remember. Luskanite raiders have plundered and razed the island's settlements more than once, but the natives keep rebuilding their villages and their ships while singing songs of bloody vengeance.

The reigning king of Ruathym is First Axe Vok Dorrg (CE male Illuskan human **priest**), a blind and vindictive old man who worships Valkur, a lesser god of the sea. The king rules from the Hall of Black Waves, a temple in the seaside [[G6 - Town|town]] of Ruathym. Although he's too old to take up arms himself, Vok Dorrg has many fierce sons, daughters, and grandchildren to captain his ships and terrorize his enemies.
