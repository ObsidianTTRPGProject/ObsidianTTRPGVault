# Mount Hotenow
## Overview
Mount Hotenow, a volcano, was situated to the northeast of the city of [[Neverwinter]] on the Sword Coast North, deep in [[Neverwinter Wood]]. It was home to a large population of fire elementals, warming the [[Neverwinter River]] to the point where it never froze over, even in the heart of winter (hence the city's name).

The volcano also had a tendency to attract creatures like fire giants and red dragons.

## History
In the Year of Knowledge Unearthed (1451 DR), a small adventuring party rediscovered the ancient dwarven city of [[Gauntlgrym]] beneath the volcano. The party, consisting of Dahlia Sin'felle, Korvin Dor'crae, Valindra Shadowmantle, Athrogate, and Jarlaxle Baenre, made it all the way to the legendary forges. There, the latter two were betrayed by their Thayan allies, with Athrogate hypnotically forced to activate the forge. This briefly awoke the primordial Maegera, who, in a fit of rage, released a burst of energy so powerful that it forced the eruption of the volcano. The resultant earthquake and combination of smoke and lava destroyed much of [[Neverwinter]], killing thousands.

## Challenges
Undead, dwarves, fire elementals, fire giants, red dragons and duergar.
