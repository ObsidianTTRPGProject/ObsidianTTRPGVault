# Arn Forest
## Overview
This stretch of pine trees and muskeg bogs lies on the northeast flank of the [[Nether Mountains]], near the western edge of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. Little is known about this forest except that rock gnomes dwell in the eastern portion. They emerge occasionally to trade furs and pelts in [[Deadsnows]] or [[Citadel Adbar]].
