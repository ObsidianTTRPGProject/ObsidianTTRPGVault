# Star Mounts
## Overview
Cloaked in clouds and vaguely menacing, these mountains rise from the heart of the [[High Forest]] and are tall enough to be seen from any edge of the forest. The Star Mounts are the site of strange, gleaming lights on clear nights, and dragons are sometimes seen flying to and from the peaks. Fierce winds swirl through and around the mountains, forcing flying creatures away or causing them to veer suddenly and crash against the rocks.
