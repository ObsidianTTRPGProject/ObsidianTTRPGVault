# Citadel Adbar

## Overview

Citadel Adbar has stood in the bitter cold of the Ice Mountains for almost eighteen centuries, impregnable and defiant. The fortress, carved out of a mountain spur, consists of two great towers ringed with spikes to keep large flying creatures from landing to attack the structures directly. The great chimney of the citadel's central foundry stands between the towers, belching smoke like a volcano about to erupt. Ringing the citadel is a host of platforms, battlements, and arrow slits from where defenders can fire crossbows at foolish attackers. A great drawbridge allows no one to enter the dwarven enclave except patrols and honored guests. Cleverly hidden traps await those who storm the halls uninvited, and beneath the citadel is an expansive network of tunnels and caverns designed to confuse would-be invaders. If Adbar's defenses should ever prove inadequate, the dwarves have created a secret evacuation tunnel that stretches for hundreds of miles, connecting to passages that lie under [[Citadel Felbarr]] to the west. Adbar's garrison offers a reward of 10 gp for each ore head brought to the city gates, or 100 gp for each giant head.

The population of Citadel Ad bar was severely depleted by the War of the [[Silver Marches]], which drew away many of Adbar's greatest warriors, including its long-ruling king, Harbromm. King Harbromm led his knights into battle against the ore hordes invading the Marches and died on the field. Harbromm's twin sons, Bromm and Harnoth, inherited the throne and, like their father, left Citadel Adbar to join the war. Bromm later perished, leaving the crown to Harnoth. Harnoth and his followers fought many battles during the war, but the new king made some poor decisions that winnowed the once great Knights of the Mithral Shield down to a handful of members. Fortunately for Harnoth, the Iron Guard-Citadel Adbar's defending army-remains strong.

What's not generally known is that Harnoth, too, was killed by ores toward the end of the war. To prevent political turmoil in Citadel Abdar, the elders of Adbar's dwarven clans hired a doppelganger to impersonate King Harnoth. True power in Citadel Adbar now lies with the clan elders, who meet in secret and tell their "king" what to do and say before every one of his public appearances. The doppelganger is so smitten with its role that it sometimes forgets itself and makes decisions that the elders haven't approved, behavior that is a growing cause of concern for some.

Citadel Adbar was a fortress named for King Adbar, the ancient dwarf who began its construction in -370 DR and completed it in -272 DR during the waning years of ancient Delzoun, making this the last shard of that once mighty dwarven kingdom. The Citadel consisted of a massive fortified fortress that provided surface access to miles and miles of defensive granite corridors, tunnels, and hallways that wind their way under the Ice Mountains. The city can house up to 60,000 dwarves in relative comfort, though less then a third of that number were usually present.

## Profile

### **People**

Citadel Adbar does not welcome visitors. This is not surprising, as most visitors are orcs or monsters seeking the swift death of its citizens, but, despite it's insular traditions and remote location, the fortress is a trading city. The dwarves dwelling here make their living by mining, smelting and forging their native ores. Their constant work causes a permanent cloud of smoke to hang over the city and creates such a din and clangor that it is just as well that the city does not entertain many guests.

Like other dwarven communities in Faerûn, the number of dwarves in Citadel Adbar had been steadily dwindling over the last several generations. In recent years, as the miners grew fewer and orc raids upon the trade-caravans became fiercer, the remaining dwarves' output decreased significantly. The renewed vigor brought about by The Thunder Blessing however, promises to help return Citadel Adbar to its former glory. While many dwarves of the new generation have left to rebuild [[Mithral Hall]] and [[Citadel Felbarr]], enough have remained so that the city is once again producing its famed goods in quantity.

For over a hundred years Citadel Adbar has been ruled by King Harbromm, and he is noted for his attention to strategy and detail. He is also a master smith and the city's badge is his personal forge mark. It is an upright, single-bladed hand axe enclosed by a circle of flame inscribed in red on a silver field. He has managed to hold his community together in the face of threats from the orcish tribes.

### **Militia**

The king employs human adventurers in patrols outside the walls, and he keeps two hundred dwarves on the battlements of the Citadel. Another 1,500 are ready to take up arms if the horn call is sounded through the speaking tubes cut in the Citadel's rock. These tubes also allow dwarves to flee quickly underground by tumbling into them. In a day, Adbar can arm and armor 9,000 dwarven warriors. Harbromm's policy is to safeguard the lives of his folk and to keep inside the Citadel whatever befalls.

The Iron Guard form part of the militia.

### **The [[Silver Marches]] Confederation**

King Harbromm was initially opposed to conjoining Citadel Adbar with the [[Silver Marches]] confederation, as he saw no benefit in it. But thanks to Emerus Warcrown and Bruenor Battlehammer, Citadel Adbar is now the Confederation's primary source of military ordnance.

## Points of Interest

### **Places**

The Citadel is a fortress. It has ditches that can be filled with flaming oil, bridges that can be drawn up or swung down into deep pits, concentric rings of walls that can be defended one by one in the event of a powerful besieging army, and so on. The Citadel has withstood over 60 orc horde attacks thus far. Each of these were determined sieges by over 10,000 orcs at a time, and occasionally 10 times that number.

The fortress that humans see is only the small surface part of an underground, dwarven hold known as Adbarrim. The Citadel exists to provide a secure connection with the [[1 - World Above|world above]] and to keep the smoke, noise, and stench of metalwork out of the dwarven homes. Miles upon miles of chambers, passages, and suites have been carved out of solid granite.

The tall towers that jut above ground were called the Dragonspikes, so named because they protected against dragon attacks with their nasty spikes. Smoke from the Foundry exited out the central tower chimney. A waterwheel operated in the lowest part of the mines. Chain hoists connected the aboveground levels to the belowground levels. Access to the citadel on the surface is facilitated by a drawbridge; access to the keep from [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]], Fardrimm, and other Delzoun strongholds was sealed off by a heavy iron portal known as the Caravan Door.

## Relationships

### **Surface Trade**

Two trade routes exist on the surface. Both start at the gates of Citadel Adbar but split very soon after that. One, barely more than a trail passes through Cold Vale to eventually reach Silverymoon. The other travels for a short way to join [[Fork Road]], at The Fork allowing access to [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Ascore]] at one end of [[Fork Road]] and Silverymoon at the other.

Surface traders brought fresh produce to Adbar and returned with metals and dwarven craftworks.\[1]

### **Underdark Trade**

As it is, only metal traders and the most desperate or daring peddlers attempt to reach Citadel Adbar. Ironically, since raiding orcs, prowling crag cats and other predators make the land around the Citadel so deadly, most caravans travel through the relative safety of [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]] via [[Sundabar]], [[Mithral Hall]] and even distant [[Mirabar]]. Caravans that survive the long and dangerous journey bring mainly grain and dried fruits and vegatables that the Citadel is incapable of producing. Fresh fruit, which the dwarves delight in eating during the winter, fetches the highest price.

Every year more than one caravan is lost in [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]] but those who are successful are richly rewarded. The dwarven smiths here make the best dwarven weapons and armor this side of the Deep Realm. All goods made in Citadel Adbar are considered masterwork and command premium prices throughout the North. In addition most of the forge bars (blocks of refined metal) used by quality smiths in The North are from Citadel Adbar. The dwarves continually mine mithral as well as other precious metals, but the recent opening of long-abandoned [[Mithral Hall]] has made the largely mined-out mithral deposits of Citadel Adbar less important.

A well-guarded route runs through [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]] from Citadel Adbar to [[Sundabar]] and also provides access to the Everfire. Once a year at Shieldmeet, a dozen master craftsmen are chosen by the king to make the perilous journey to the forge at Everfire. They are each given an entire year to create a single magical weapon or piece of armor commissioned by the king for an undisclosed champion of Citadel Adbar. These priceless artifacts are presented to the most deserving defenders of the city, as chosen by the king, and are almost always dwarves, however at least one dwarf friend has been awarded this great honor.

## Suggested Encounters

Adventurers are welcome in Citadel Adbar, and news of their arrival is quickly brought to the doppelganger- king's attention. After meeting with the clan elders, "Harnoth" demands a private audience with the adventurers in his throne hall. In the presence of three elders (LG male shield dwarf nobles armed with warhammers instead of rapiers) and four bodyguards (LG male and female shield dwarf guards armed with warhammers instead of spears), the king asks the characters to attack [[Ironslag]], a fire giant forge in the mountains to the northwest. Dwarven patrols have seen fire giants hauling large fragments of adamantine to the underground forge, which had until recently stood abandoned. "Harnoth" wants the adventurers to find out what the giants are doing and thwart them if possible.

"Harnoth" promises that if the characters agree to explore [[Ironslag]] and return with evidence of a successful mission, such as Duke Zalto's head or a group of freed dwarven prisoners, he will reward each character with a rare magic item of that individual's choice. He secures the desired items while the characters are off completing their quest. If the characters have already cleared out [[Ironslag]], the king expresses his surprise and gratitude and urges them to rest in Adbar while he gathers their rewards. For more information on [[Ironslag]], see chapter 8, "Forge of the Fire Giants."

As the doppelganger-king is trying to persuade the adventurers to undertake his quest, or in the wake of their foray to [[Ironslag]], seven yakfolk warriors (see appendix C) barge into the throne hall to kill the king and the adventurers. The yakfolk have used their Wind Ghost power to possess six Knights of the Mithra! Shield. These individuals use the knight statistics, with the following changes:

- The knights are lawful good shield dwarves that speak Common and Dwarvish. While they are possessed by yakfolk, their alignment is lawful evil and they also speak Yikaria (the yakfolk tongue).

- Each knight carries a shield and has AC 20.

- Each knight wields a warhammer (instead of a greatsword) that deals 7 (ld8 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a hit, or 8 (ldlO + 3) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.

- Each knight has a walking speed of 25 feet and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

- Each knight has advantage on saving throws against poison, and resistance to poison damage.

The king, curiously, seems reluctant to enter the fray. "Harnoth" calls for the treacherous knights to stand down, but they ignore his commands. As combat ensues, the elders withdraw from the audience chamber to summon reinforcements, which arrive after the battle ends. As the characters battle the knights, the king's bodyguards surround and protect their lord. They join the fray only if the characters are on the verge of defeat.

If the adventurers defeat the possessed dwarves, "Harnoth" urges them to stay in Citadel Adbar for a couple of days while he arranges for suitable rewards. He commissions jewelers to craft mithral medals (one per character) shaped like shields, and he also drafts a signed letter of recommendation and presents it to the party. The bearer of the letter gains advantage on Charisma checks made to influence shield dwarves throughout the North. For more information on medals and letters of recommendation, see the "Marks of Prestige" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
