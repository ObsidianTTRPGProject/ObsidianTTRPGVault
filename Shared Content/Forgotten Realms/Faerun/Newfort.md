# Newfort
## Overview
Newfort is a motte-and-bailey stockade on the south side of the [[Fork Road]], east of [[Sundabar]] in the foothills of the [[Rauvin Mountains]]. A few dozen wood-frame cottages stand outside the stockade, as does a cozy tavern called the Hero's Reward, run by an amiable and talkative young half-elf named Delf Dereldar (LG male halfelf commoner). Delf spends his idle time gazing at a chessboard on the bar; he plays regular games with the village constable,Jorok Narm (N male half-ore veteran), who drops in after work hours for a drink or two before retiring for the evening.

Two retired members of the Zhentarim founded Newport. They are long dead, and over the years the settlement has become less of a Black Network stronghold and more of a way station open to anyone in need of a safe place to spend the night. Constable Narm and his militia of twenty guards (N male and female humans of various ethnicities) keep the peace.
