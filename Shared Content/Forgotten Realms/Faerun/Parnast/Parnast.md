# Parnast
## Overview
Parnast is an unremarkable village nestled between the foothills of the [[Graypeak Mountains]] and the [[Weathercote Forest]]. A map and description of Parnast appear in the adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen.

> [!note] Read-Aloud
> The village has a few dozen houses and a small square, with buildings that include a tavern, a stable, and a shrine. In contrast to this rustic burg stands a mighty ice castle half hidden in a fog-shrouded ravine: walls stand forty feet high, huge narrow towers loom upward— one of blue ice, one crumbling— and all of it is built to a scale for giants. Wisps of fog hide much of the castle’s detail, but you see two statues standing just before the enormous gate.
> 

This small village is secretly under the control of the Cult of the Dragon. The cultists load and unload goods here, and some of those goods are sent to Talis’s hunting lodge.

Cultists posing as villagers are unfriendly toward visitors, while villagers under the cult’s sway remain silent and withdraw from visitors for fear of incurring the cult’s wrath.

If the characters demand to speak with someone in charge, they are directed to **Captain Othelstan** (appendix B) but are also warned that he has no time or patience for dealing with outlaws.
