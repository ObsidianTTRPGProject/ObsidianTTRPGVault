# Deadsnows
## Overview
The [[Nether Mountains]] throw cold shadows over the [[G6 - Town|town]] of Deadsnows, nestled in the alpine bosom of two foothills. Sheep graze on the lower slopes, guarded by crossbow-toting shepherds, as they nibble at the coarse grass that grows between rocky outcroppings. Beyond the grazing fields, the land rises to [[Crags|crags]] covered sparsely with fir trees, and then to the mist-shrouded and snow-covered mountains that rear into the sky.

The main feature of Deadsnows is the Hospice of Marthammor, a fortified abbey in the middle of [[G6 - Town|town]]. Surrounding it are several wood-frame buildings that make up the [[G6 - Town|town]], and all is contained within a crumbling wall that's in desperate need of repair. Winter roses along the wall blossom throughout the year. Just inside the wall, overlooking the road that leads to the [[G6 - Town|town]], is a stone watchtower. A banner flies from its topmost turret, depicting the golden sunrise of Lathander. A dozen worshipers of the Morninglord (LG male and female priests and acolytes of various races) staff the watchtower.

The abbey is a dwarf-made fortress dedicated to Marthammor Duin, the dwarven god of wanderers. The abbey's venerable leader, Kerrilla Gemstar (NG female shield dwarf priest of Marthammor Duin), oversees a staff of commoners who have taken vows of service. The abbey offers assistance to anyone in need, while the clerics of the Watchtower are devoted to protecting the [[G6 - Town|town]] and insuring the well-being of its residents.

The Icespear noble family held much influence in Deadsnows for many generations, until Lord Delvon Ices pear was killed in the War of the [[Silver Marches]]. He left no heirs, and the family estate has been locked up ever since. Halfhearted attempts to locate other members of the lcespear family have proven fruitless. The [[G6 - Town|town]] has survived for several seasons without a governor- no one in [[G6 - Town|town]] wants the power or the burden.

Visitors who would rather not endure the bland food and drafty halls of the Hospice can find a cozy tavern, the Blazon, and a decent inn, the Rose and Hammer, within the [[G6 - Town|town]].
