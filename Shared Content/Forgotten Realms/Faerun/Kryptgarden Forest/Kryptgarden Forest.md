# Kryptgarden Forest
## Overview
A small wooded region near [[Westbridge]] hides many old dwarven ruins and the extensive underground city known as Southkrypt. For centuries, Kryptgarden Forest has been the home and hunting ground of the ancient female green dragon [[Claugiyliamatar]], better known to many as Old Gnawbone. She earned her nickname from her habit of gnawing on old kills, and is often seen with a mangled corpse hanging from her mouth. Other dragons rarely remain in Kryptgarden Forest for long, because [[Claugiyliamatar]] drives them out.

## Suggested Encounter
[[Claugiyliamatar]] rarely meddles in the affairs of small folk. Even so, her collection of crystal balls allows her to stay abreast of events happening in the world. She is aware that giants have become nuisances once more, and that adventurers have their work cut out for them. As the characters travel through her forest, Old Gnawbone's woodland spies (birds, rodents, and other harmless forest critters) warn her of their presence. She decides on a whim to leave her lair and confront them. The characters hear something enormous approaching them through the dark woods and tangled underbrush, and they might be startled when a great green dragon's head bursts into view with the tenderized corpse of an Uthgardt barbarian dangling from its mouth.

If the characters attack [[Claugiyliamatar]], she breathes poison gas at them, takes to the air, and returns to her hidden lair. If the characters restrain themselves, she tells them (in Common) to travel north to the [[Valley of Khedrun]] and search for a giant temple called the [[Eye of the All-Father]]. "Therein," she says, "you'll learn what must be done to end the giant menace." She also tells them to keep an eye out for a frost giant wearing a helm made from a white dragon's skull, as he can help them. (See the "Harshnag" section later in this chapter.) Once she has imparted this information, Old Gnawbone takes flight and returns to her lair to finish her meal.
