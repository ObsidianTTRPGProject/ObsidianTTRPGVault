Claugiyliamatar rarely meddles in the affairs of small folk. Even so, her collection of crystal balls allows her to stay abreast of events happening in the world. She is aware that giants have become nuisances once more, and that adventurers have their work cut out for them. As the characters travel through her forest, Old Gnawbone's woodland spies (birds, rodents, and other harmless forest critters) warn her of their presence. She decides on a whim to leave her lair and confront them. The characters hear something enormous approaching them through the dark woods and tangled underbrush, and they might be startled when a great green dragon's head bursts into view with the tenderized corpse of an Uthgardt barbarian dangling from its mouth.   

If the characters attack Claugiyliamatar, she breathes poison gas at them, takes to the air, and returns to her hidden lair. If the characters restrain themselves, she tells them (in Common) to travel north to the [[Valley of Khedrun]] and search for a giant temple called the [[Eye of the All-Father]]. "Therein," she says, "you'll learn what must be done to end the giant menace." She also tells them to keep an eye out for a frost giant wearing a helm made from a white dragon's skull, as he can help them. (See the "Harshnag" section later in this chapter.) Once she has imparted this information, Old Gnawbone takes flight and returns to her lair to finish her meal.   

Claugiyliamatar is an ancient green dragon, with the following additional features that increase her challenge rating to 23 (50,000 XP).
