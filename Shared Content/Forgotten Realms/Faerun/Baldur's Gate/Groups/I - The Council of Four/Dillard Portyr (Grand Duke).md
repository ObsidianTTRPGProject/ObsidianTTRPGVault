Dillard Portyr is a short, portly man in his sixties. His once black hair is now gray and sparse, and he wears a shabby wig out of habit rather than vanity. A vet eran investor, shipping-fleet owner, and trader, Portyr recently pulled back from the business world follow ing a string of sour deals. Now he is using his time to enjoy the comforts that his wealth and title have pro vided him. Having outlived two wives and three sons, Duke Portyr now lives quietly in a relatively unassum ing manor in the Temples district that a handful of devoted servants maintain.

## Story
Portyr doesn’t like conflict and avoids stress. In social situations, the grand duke is likable and enter taining, spending much of his energy to make sure others feel good and are having fun. As a leader, Grand Duke Portyr is a weathercock, turning whichever way the wind blows. Even though his Council of Four vote breaks ties, he’s never had to use that authority.

Anyone who attempts to appeal to Grand Duke Portyr to solve a problem might come to realize that the city’s leader is putty in the hands of the powerful. He is known for listening with concern, showing an earnest desire to help, making promises to look into things—and then doing nothing, if doing something would mean facing conflict.
