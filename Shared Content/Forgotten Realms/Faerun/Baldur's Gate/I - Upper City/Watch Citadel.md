# Watch Citadel
## Overview
**Type**: Point of Interest, Building, Landmark
#Location/Point-of-Interest #Location/Building #Location/Landmark

The [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]’s police force uses [[V - The Watch|the Watch]] Citadel as a barracks and for training, stor age, and organizational needs. The citadel has only a few jail cells, which [[V - The Watch|the Watch]] uses to temporarily hold those awaiting a trial in the [[High Hall (The Ducal Palace)|High Hall]] or a trans fer to the prison in [[The Seatower of Balduran|the Seatower of Balduran]].

[[V - The Watch|The Watch]] staffs the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]’s walls and runs interior patrols day and night. The [[I - Upper City|Upper City]] is the exclusive domain of [[V - The Watch|the Watch]]; [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] has no jurisdiction here. And, conversely, [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]] do not call upon Watch members to work outside the area’s bounds. Watch members all live in the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]], and most belong to families that have a proud tra dition of loyalty to [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]]. At night, [[V - The Watch|the Watch]] evicts everyone from the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]] except for residents and their guests. All Watch members know every patriar by sight. Anyone else is detained and politely (at first) questioned.

Watch patrols release anyone who has a good reason to be out and is dressed in a patriar’s house livery, bears a patriar-signed invitation, or carries a Watch-issued stamped and numbered wooden or silver badge. Passes that [[V - The Watch|the Watch]] supplies are collected and changed often to foil counterfeiters.
