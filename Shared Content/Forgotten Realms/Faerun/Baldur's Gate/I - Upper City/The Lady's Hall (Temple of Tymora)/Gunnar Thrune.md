# Gunnar Thrune
## Overview
**Gender**: Male
#Gender/Male

Gunnar Thrune, a transplant from [[Gundarlun]] Island in the cold northern sea, is the loud-voiced and ever-smiling temple patriarch. Boisterous to a fault, Thrune can be found wherever betting is fast and furious, egging on gamblers with shouts and hearty backslapping. In times of crisis in the Gate, Thrune immediately encourages and presides over bets regarding the involved parties, his actions effectively proclaiming the temple’s neutrality.

Priest of Tymora.
