# High Hall (The Ducal Palace)
## Overview
**Type**: Building
#Location/Building

## Description
The High Hall once stood as the central bastion in the defense of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]. In its heyday, it was an ugly, powerful, and functional fortification. Its years as a defensive structure ended long ago, though. Since then, so many modifications have been made to the building in the interest of comfort and beauty that the lines of the original fort are hard to see. The basic structure remains, however. The building encloses a central courtyard, which was once a bailey. Graceful windows now pierce the heavy walls, and soaring spires and leering gargoyles stand in place of the original battlements.

The building known as the High Hall was once the city’s last bastion against invasion, and it served that function again when Balduran’s associ ates led their tax revolt. Since then, alterations to let in more natural light and make the space a more com fortable place from which to govern have weakened its status as a fortress. The High Hall is used for pro fessional guild meetings, civic events, court trials, tax counting, real-estate and law record-keeping, and any thing to do with governance, including meetings of the [[III - Parliament of Peers|Parliament of Peers]] and [[I - The Council of Four|the Council of Four]].

The long-held tradition of the whole citizenry voting to elect dukes to the four lifetime posts ended after an attempted coup. Today, a parliament of representatives chosen from among [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]] and the most wealthy and influential [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] residents elects new dukes. One of the four dukes holds the title of grand duke and is empowered to break ties when the council’s vote is evenly split. By tradition, and in the interest of good politics, one duke is always a high-ranking member of [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]], the mercenary company that is the city’s de facto army.

## Points of Interest
Almost all the governmental business of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] is conducted here. The four dukes have sumptuous offices and private meeting rooms in their own wing. The [[III - Parliament of Peers|Parliament of Peers]] has a dozen small meet ing rooms and one large chamber for whole-body deliberations. The chamber’s gallery seats an audience of three hundred. Those seats are almost always filled when parliament is in session; on rare occasion, though, parliament clears the house for closed-door debate over matters considered too sensitive or inflam matory for spectators.

The High Hall also contains court chambers where the dukes sit in judgment (individually, seldom as a group) over accused criminals. The dukes often assign this duty to proxy judges on a rotating basis. Proxy judges are not paid a salary, yet a temporary assign ment to the High Hall’s bench is a plum duty for any patriar, because hefty gifts and bribes flow to judges from [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]], from those grateful to be exonerated, and from those hoping to be exonerated.

Serving as a judge is not light duty. The only cases that require the decision-making of a judge are those that involve real doubt about a defendant’s guilt, or unclear points of law. When someone is caught in the act of committing a crime, or close enough to the performance of the act that the presiding officer is reasonably certain that the suspect is guilty, the indi vidual’s “trial” boils down to a simple administrative and sentencing process that [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] or [[V - The Watch|the Watch]] directly handles. It’s not uncommon for some one arrested for picking pockets in the morning to be already serving a sentence in jail by evening.

Aside from the aforementioned governmental offices, the High Hall is a place that Baldurians can enjoy. It includes a feasting hall that is used for both public and private banquets and a wing of meeting rooms that are available to everyone on a first-come, first-served basis. The courtyard contains a small public [[Garden|garden]] that features walkways and benches. Theoretically, anyone is welcome here. In practice, though, hardly anyone except for patriars uses the space. Everyone else is too busy working to spend much time lolling in the High Hall’s [[Garden|garden]].

The High Hall houses several small libraries tucked in and about the structure on different levels and in different vings. These libraries contain all the city’s records going back hundreds of years. Laws, contracts, architectural plans, court proceedings, government appointments, accounting documents, tax rolls, census information, land grants, guild charters, and other documents are packed into rows upon rows of shelves and tall scroll cases. In theory, the libraries are divided by topic of inquiry, but in actuality only the librarians (devotees of Oghma who volunteer their time) can make much sense of them. Some frustrated patriars and various barristers have campaigned in the past to have all the libraries combined and catalogued in a sensible way, but there’s never been enough political will behind the effort to dedicate funds for it.

## Background
In addition to being a place of civic activity, the High Hall also serves as a kind of secular temple. The ground floor of the easternmost wing is a museum to the history of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] and a mausoleum for its many dukes and heroes. There, a statue of Balduran looms over the city’s “holy relics” in a glass case. The items inside are things he supposedly owned: a bat tered helmet, tattered pieces of a cloak, a longsword in a cracked leather sheath, a steel shield, and, oddly, a butter knife. Lesser heroes recline in marble upon beds of stone or sit enthroned, bronze upon bronze. gazing toward some unseen horizon with reso lute nobility, their bones dry as twigs in the caskets beneath them. All dukes have the right to be buried in the mauso leum, and most of those who are entombed on the site lie under the floor, so that anyone who w-alks through the room is stepping over graves. Because of the vaulted dungeons beneath the High Hall, those interred in the floor end up suspended somewhere in the stonework between the museum’s floor and the dungeon’s ceiling. Some graves have collapsed into the dungeons below, a fact detectable from above by the hollow boom of foot steps on particular flagstones. The [[III - Parliament of Peers|Parliament of Peers]] decided not to address the issue of these “fallen heroes,” since they were assured by dwarf engineers that the floor of the museum is in no danger of collapse.

The building’s entire structure is part of the Gate’s advanced water system. Below-ground catch basinscollect rainwater that runs off its roof. That water flows through aqueducts to a cistern beneath the great fountain in the Temples district. Thanks to the innovative pumps of Chuch of Gond, the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]’s fountains are both beautiful works of flowing-water art and sources of safe, clean water for residents. The original fortification’s dungeons still exist. Unlike the High Hall above them, they have seen little renovation and no beautification since they were excavated. Under vaulted ceilings supported by thick pillars lie dozens of brick-lined chambers linked by winding, rock-cut passages into a labyrinth that few dare to traverse.

Entrance to the underground area can be had by way of a handful of staircases tucked into odd corners of the High Hall, as well as an unknown number of connections to the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]’s water system. A handful of chambers nearest the stairs have been converted into jail cells, but they are seldom used. The near-constant rain keeps the dungeons perpetually damp and dripping. The only dangers in the area come from swarming rats and the threat of becoming lost in the unmapped, echoing dark ness. No one knows whether the master of walls, the master of cobbles, or the master of drains and under ways should be in charge of the dungeons. Consequently, no one takes responsibility.
