## Description
The tower is named after Rarnazith, the sailorturned- wizard who designed and erected it. During his days as a mariner, Ramazith acquired vast knowl edge of the sea. He became a full-fledged wizard to further his interest in what lay beneath the waves. He must have discovered something of great value in the watery depths, because he had never been known as a  wealthy person before ‘ construction began on the tower that would Ramazith s Tower bear his name and whose exotic architecture would remind him of his home in faraway Durpar.

Eventually, Ramazith disappeared. No one knows where or how but the most popular rumor is that he met his doom during an ill-advised dalliance with a nymph. The tower is now home to Lorroakan, a young, short-tempered, red-haired mage known for having expensive taste and being chronically short of funds. He is a recent arrival from Athkatla. Some Baldurians gossip openly that he is the mysterious “Tallhat,” reputed owner of [[The Undercellar|the Undercellar]]. Others whisper cautiously that he is an exiled Cowled Wizard and a fugitive from the arcanist cabal’s founders, House Selemchant in Amn.

Even though Lorroakan performs almost any magic service for pay, he most often enchants clothes to make them water- and mildew-repellent, which is quite handy, given the Gate’s constant rain and moisture. Lorroakan refuses to sell the ritual to anyone.
