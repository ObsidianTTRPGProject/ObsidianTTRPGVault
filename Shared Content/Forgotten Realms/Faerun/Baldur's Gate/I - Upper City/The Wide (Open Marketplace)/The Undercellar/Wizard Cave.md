# Wizard Cave
## Overview
**Type**: Building, Other
#Location/Building #Location/Other

Rumor has it that a tower of stone, whose origin is unknown, stands on the brink of a vast crevasse some where deep beneath the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]. A wizard who used it as his home reportedly spoke of it on his infre quent trips to the surface. No one has seen the wizard in thirty years. Now his tower stands empty in the dark, awaiting anyone brave enough to search for the secret sewer-to-cavern path leading to the structure. Baldurians call the tower’s location Wizard Cave, and the term has become synonymous with “a fruitless and foolhardy endeavor.” For example, “So you’re going looking for Wizard Cave?” or “Steal from the [[Counting House]]? That’s a Wizard Cave!”

Few believe the rumors. But the tower and cavern do exist, and the wizard did die . . . after a fashion. The magic of the tower’s mysterious builders has trapped the wizard’s spirit in undeath within the structure—to what purpose, no one knows. Perhaps the tower was originally a conqueror’s vanguard outpost, or maybe the structure stands in defense over such a location.
