# Jopalin's (Tavern)
## Overview
Once a seedy dockside tavern catering to sailors with thin purses, Jopalin’s transitioned into a cafe when coffee and tea drinking became fashionable—and as membership fees increased for the tavernkeepers guild. The low-ceilinged eatery and its dockside seat ing is now an establishment that sailors largely spurn. Merchants and traders frequent Jopalin’s when they want to appear fashionable and sophisticated but are too busy to leave the port to take meals elsewhere. Jopalin, the cafe’s owner, is the half-elf son of the tav ern’s founder, after whom he was named.
