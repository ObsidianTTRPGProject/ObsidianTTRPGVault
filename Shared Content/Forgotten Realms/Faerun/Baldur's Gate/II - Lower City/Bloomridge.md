## Description
[[II - Lower City|Lower City]] citizens generally lead a working-class existence, but successful merchants, ship captains, landlords, and others who have access to wealth try to live as much like patriars as they can. Rich folk sometimes purchase several [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] buildings, or even small blocks, and either raze the structures or modify and connect them to form a palatial home. Slightly less prosperous folk typically rent expensive, upper-floor apartments, preferring locations that feature rooftop terraces or balconies that offer fine views.

These impressive homes are mostly found in Bloomridge, a fashionable [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] district dotted with cafes, flower shops, and artisan boutiques. The district’s main street runs steeply up from the harbor to the Old Wall. Numerous structures have exterior staircases and open terraces built into or against the wall.
