These diminutive folk (averaging just over four feet tall) may be descended from marriages between humans and dwarves in the Tethyamar area. They are the desert folk most commonly encountered by outlanders.

### D'Tarig explorers

## Profile

The Dtarig dwell on the eastern and southeastern fringes of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], where they herd goats and sheep in the foothills, and make rare trips to Tilverton to trade. (Since [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] started coming to them, these trips have grown even rarer. Why go to the trouble and expense of travel, when it is easier to let greedy buyers come to you?) Dtarig tend to be self-serving and rather cowardly. They will switch loyalties readily, to those who pay them most highly.

## Philosophy

In the desert, Dtarig wear white burnooses and turbans, with splay-footed sandwalking boots,. Only their dark eyes, puggish noses, and leathery brows are exposed. Older, more greedy Dtarig who are braver than their fellows are known as desert walkers, for they venture into the desert to trade metal (usually metal weapons, though pots and other vessels are also valued) to [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] in return for camel-loads of collected resin from cassia, myrrh, and frankincense trees.

Some Dtarig can collect these resins for themselves, from trees growing on the verges of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]], on the banks of streams that come down rocky ravines from the Mountains of Tethyamar to meander among the dunes, and ultimately sink into the sand, and vanish). But it is easiest to let Bedine do all the messy, hot, long work of gathering-and the demand for the resin far outstrips the supply provided by the few trees that the Dtarig can reach. The Dtarig sell their jars of gathered resin to merchants sponsored by [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]]. The friendly Black Robes then sell it to temples all over the Realms for the making of incense.

They boast that no one and nothing can beguile the Dtarig? Dtarig are selfish, brutish folk. They have none of the land-lore and stone-skill of dwarves; most do not even know that lodestones (and therefore, compasses) exist, and must find their way in the desert by learning the oasis-trails and the stars. They tend to keep to themselves out of fear for trouble. More than one Dtarig has said, Only a fool strays from his path to search out another mans trouble.

On the other hand, Dtarig are not humorless or wretchedly craven in their fear of danger; witness this exchange between Bhadla of the Dtarig and Lander, a Harper (from the novel The Parched Sea, by Troy Denning): *"*

> *Bhadla shook his head. This is foolish business, he said. It will probably get you killed. Perhaps, Lander agreed. Ill try not to take you and Musalim with me. Good. For that, we would charge extra, Bhadla said . . ."*

## Religion

Dtarig worship the same gods as other humans, and the faith of The Lord of the Sands vanished with [[IV - The Lost Kingdoms|The Lost Kingdoms]].

## Relationships

Dtarig have their own throaty language, and largely avoid contact with other humans. The exceptions to this are the most adventurous of the tribe, who tend to be younger. They are often hired by outsiders who want guides into the desert, for they typically claim to be experts who know every dune and oasis of great [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. The unwary are warned of the Sembian merchant saying about Dtarig claims: If you have an infant son, and the son dies when a Dtarig is in town, the Dtarig will show up claiming to be the son of your son, and try to take everything you own.

## Organization

They like to travel in large groups, wellarmed with poisoned javelins and bolts for their crossbows. The sticky brown venom they have developed is a secret preparation, known only to a few elders of the people. It causes sleep in humans (save vs. poison to avoid), but tends to be fatal to orcs, goblins, and other related humanoids (save vs. poison at -2: success means `dice: 2d4` points of additional damage, failure means death in `dice: 1d4` rounds).

Because of their short height, D'tarig could not wield heavy weapons or swords longer than short swords. Warriors armed themselves with poisoned javelins and crossbow bolts. They had a unique poison that they employed, the preparation of which was a secret to their people. It induced sleep in humans but was fatal to orcs, goblinoids, and some other humanoids.

## Resources

Dtarig have been known to keep slaves, but tend to regard them as too much trouble. Slaves have to be watched constantly, for the Dtarig are a suspicious people.

## Background

DMs should portray Dtarig as suspicious, taciturn, even sullen folk who are too short to wield long swords or longer and heavier weapons, and whose stature forces them into comical climbs into camel and horse saddles. Otherwise, they should be considered normal humans, save that a few (10%) seem to have inherited the uncanny sense of direction (even in dark, underground, or unfamiliar surroundings) possessed by many dwarves.

Oh, and one other thinga Dtarig always has six or seven more tricks, double-crosses, escape routes, fallback plans, and poisoned weapons up his sleeves, down his boots, in his hair, or even up his nose. (Short-tempered barbarians of the Savage North have been known to cut down Dtarig on sight, just to avoid all the irritating, wearying intrigue and treachery they know will come.) Most Dtarig that adventurers will meet with are fighters or thieves of 2nd to 5th (`dice: 1d4 + 1`) level. They tend to guide visitors to the trading villages of [[Tel Badir]] and [[Addas Babar]].

Most Dtarig have a house or place of business in one or both of these settlements, but keep their families safe in comfortably furnished cave homes higher in the mountains. Orc and goblin attacks have made regular patrols in the heights necessary; adventurers are warned that these patrols tend to employ ambushes, poisoned weapons, trip-wires, and boulder avalanches first, and ask questions of the survivors (if any) later.
