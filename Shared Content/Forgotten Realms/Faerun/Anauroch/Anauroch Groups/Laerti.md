## Profile
These ruthless, aggressive, desert-dwelling, intelligent lizards are fully detailed in the Monsters of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] chapter, but deserve mention here because of their dominance over the desert underways of the eastern Sword. Forced to shelter from the heat of the day, the laertis can roam the desert surface by night, and over the years have slain many Bedine both for food (they eat the soft organs of humans) and for the pleasure of killing. [[The Bedine]] call them asahis, which means The Evil Ones Below. Recently, the laertis have been hired by [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] as mercenary troops in a war of extermination against [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] as [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] try repeatedly and forcibly to create a trade route across the desert, controlled by themselves, to link the rich Moonsea trade with Waterdeep, Baldurs Gate, and the Sword Coast trade that those cities can reach. [[The Zhentarim]] see this shortest and cheapest route as the key to achieving supremacy over Amn in trade matters. Only the years will tell if they can forge and hold such a golden road through the sands.

Called asabis by [[The Bedine|the Bedine]], these desert-dwelling reptiles are superficially similar to the lizard men of the swamplands. Laertis tend to be brown or grey in hue, with dun or light green underbellies; their larger cousins, stingtails, tend to be brown or dark reddish-brown. Laertis and stingtails both have yellow, egg-shaped eyes so bright that they flash in darkness, with horizontal slit pupils. They wear only leather armor, speak their own sharp, chattery language, and their sexes appear identical to human eyes. Laertis can run on all fours or stand upright, but their tails are not prehensile; those of stingtails are prehensile. Both laertis and stingtails closely resemble the tiny lizards of the sands: unlike lizard men, their limbs protrude from their sinuous bodies at right angles, and they move with quick, ungainly gestures. Their narrow skulls have sloping foreheads that end in a protruding brow, and swing from side to side atop a thin, awkward neck. They touch and smell partially with their flicking tongues, and have rough, pebbly skin, with gashes for ears and noses.

## Organization
On the surface of desert lands, laertis are only encountered at night. They must spend the day hiding from the sun, either burrowed a few feet beneath the sand, or in a cave, or huddled in a rock crevice. Their body temperatures prohibit them from activity in the hot sun: more than 2-5 turns of enforced marching or carrying in the sun will cause a laerti to collapse.

Left to themselves, laertis dwell in tribes, under the rule of a council of elders and a war-leader. They may ally themselves with dark nagas and other co-operative evil creatures for mutual gain, or even adopt these are members of the tribe. Every laerti tribe has at least `dice: 2d8` stingtail members. They have tunnels everywhere under the desert, and often emerge by night to raid surface locales.

Most laertis of Anauroch are controlled by [[The Phaerimm|the Phaerimm]], and live in war-bands or other groups at the whim of their masters.

## Resources
Laertis eat the internal organs (soft parts) of humans, camels, and other prey, tearing open the bodies and leaving the rest for vultures. They also eat certain subterranean fungi, such as lichens, mushrooms, and myconids, and certain taproots that enter the depths from the surface world, above. The same poisons affect laerti and stingtails as affect humans, except that both are immune to stingtail tail poison.

## Methods
Laertis hire themselves out as mercenaries to surface beings, or hunt surface-dwelling Bedine and less intelligent creatures on their own, using any sort of one-handed sword they can fashion or capture, and crude crossbows (equal to light crossbows ) which they carry slung on their backs. Laertis are quite cunning, and enjoy ambushing prey. By strict rule, they do not fight among themselves. Laertis can readily burrow into and out of the sand, rising silently from buried concealment to strike down foes. They can run swiftly on all fours, their serpentine tails twitching behind (increasing their effective armor class to 4 vs. opponents who are using missile weapons against them). At will they can rise upright on their rear legs to fight, or leap up to 20' horizontally or 16 upwards.

A rarer, related laerti variety, stingtails live peacefully with laerti brethren: the two species are cross-fertile, 10% of the young being stingtails and the rest laertis. Stingtails are less intelligent than laertis, but larger and stronger, and are usually content to follow the orders and aims of laertis.

Stingtails employ the same sorts of weapons in battle as laertis, but can also use their tails for 2d4damage slaps or coil them around melee weapons, wielding them for normal damage. At will (to a maximum of six times/day), a stingtail making a successful hit with its tail (when not holding a weapon or using the tail to hang onto a ledge or branch) on an opponent can elect to release a spray of liquid poison through skin pores.

This caustic, vinegarscented secretion causes victims hit by it to be confused for the round of striking and the round that follows, and forces a save vs. poison to avoid Type M contact poison effects (see DMG). Stingtails are of little use to Phaerimm and wizards seeking slaves, because they are immune to the effects of all known magits of the enchantment/charm school.
