# N'asr (Cyric/Kelemvor)
## Overview
Nasr, the Lord of the Dead, is [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] name for Cyric, the god of death, murder, and tyranny (who has taken the place of Myrkul). The great white-bearded vultures of the desert, known as Nasrs children: are said to ferry spirits to the camp of the dead, taking the dead to Nasrs tent (which is somewhere westwards, beyond the setting sun), where the Pitiless One awaits.

N'asr was a Bedine deity. He was the god of dead for the Bedines.

Djinn serve Nasr; he gives the dead who displease him or who dont measure up to them for sport, and then food. The worst fate of a Bedine is to wind up the slave of Nasr, so Bedine dead are washed to cleanse away the odor of life, to avoid offending Nasr. Clerical details for Cyric appear in the FORGOTTEN REALMS® Adventures sourcebook; [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] fear such priests, and will attack them.

[[The Bedine]] claim Nasr is the suns lover. The sun, Atar, foresakes her lawful husband [[Kozah (Talos)|Kozah]] every night to sleep in Nasrs tent.

Is in fact Cyric or Kelemvor.
