# The Wall of Fallen Djinn
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Hills
#Geographical-Region/Hills

Bordering [[The Shoal of Thirst|the Shoal of Thirst]] (see above) is a row of foothills cut through by wadis, and studded with sparse saltbrush bushes. They rise into a range of mountains five thousand feet high. [[The Sister of Rains]] oasis (see above) is located in a canyon at the base of the largest peak in this range.

From afar, the mountain range looks like a gray or dun-colored wall studded with dark spots (qassis and acacia trees). Its name comes from an ancient battle, in which a Bedine tribe that dwelt on the mountain slopes (then, it is said, well-watered by springs, and covered with a forest) perished to the last child, fighting off some djinn. Other Bedine later found evidence that [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] had slain over twenty djinn, an unheard-of feat.
