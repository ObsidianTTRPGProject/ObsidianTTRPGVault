# Olomaa
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

A rich oasis of fruit trees and young frankincense trees, recently created by [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] (see Created Oases, earlier in this chapter). Olomaa sprawls over two large hills and the valley between them, and is guarded by a palisade of giant cacti, inside a dry ditch. The sand ditch is home to many waiting, buried spring-sword traps. Triggering one of these causes the blade to burst up out of the sands, striking at THAC0 6 for its maximum normal damage. The ditch is crossed by two stone-slab bridges, leading to man-high gates of iron, bristling with outward-projecting spear-tips.

Within, Olomaa has a small, fenced pasture area, several bathing-pools and even a waterfountain, sheltered by arbors that bear many small hanging and creeping plants. A simple stone house at its center houses the four Zhentilar warrior-gardeners, their supervisor (apriest of Cyric), and the main guardian of the oasis: a beholder by the name of Xualahuu. It has lost the use of several eyes (DMs choice of which ones), and is recuperating here, relatively safe from the intrigue of Zhentil Keep and the warring rival eye tyrants of the northcoast Moonsea cities. Fiercely loyal to Manshoon of [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]], it will guard its oasis cunningly and zealously, seeking any chance to destroy intruders, seize magic, and gather treasure and valuable captives for the Brotherhood.
