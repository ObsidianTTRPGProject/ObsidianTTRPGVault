## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Canyon, Plateau
#Geographical-Region/Canyon #Geographical-Region/Plateau

This series of cloven and rocky spires rises out of dry desert, in the form of several barren ridges that form the shape of a gigantic chicken s foot, its toes pointing northeast. Its name means the Slashed Rocks, and comes from the cracked appearance of the peaks. Some Bedine have told of finding rich gold veins here, but few go looking; the deep crevices in these rocks lead down to caverns where [[Laerti]] dwell (see the Monsters of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] chapter). The [[Laerti]] come each night to hunt, sometimes ranging east as far as merchant encampments around [[Addas Babar]], where they devour the internal organs of camels and men alike.

[[The Zhentarim]] contacted the [[Laerti]] to hire them as mercenary warriors in an attempt to seize control of the surface Sword (see [[The Zhentarim]] in Anauroch), here. It is a place avoided by [[The Bedine|the Bedine]].
