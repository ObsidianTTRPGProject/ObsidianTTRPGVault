# Rasilith
## Overview
**Type**: Dungeon, Ruin
#Adventure-Area/Dungeon #Adventure-Area/Ruin

In the depths of [[The Quarter of Emptiness|the Quarter of Emptiness]], an ancient city stands half-buried in a massive dune. Its encircling walls are of gray stone, as thick as a camel is tall. Inside the walls, the buildings stand intact, around a central fortress.

Some sages believe this city was once Tower Hlithal, westernmost of the settlements of Anauria. Others think that it lies too far west to be Hlithal, and is even older, a remnant of a human realm that preceded what are called The Lost Kingdoms today.

Few folk have explored Rasilith, to settle the dematter. A generation ago, a Bedine tribe did come upon the intact city, and made plans to settle therebefore disaster fell upon them. In the central courtyard of the fortress was a well. Warriors descending to clean it out said it went down five hundred feet, opening into a great labyrinth of underground grottos filled with rivers of cool water. A fantastic claim, that seemedbut hundreds of buckets of water, as sweet as honey and cool as the night, were drawn up in a single day, and the flow never slowed. The de lighted Bedine had little time to enjoy their new home; when night fell, asabis ([[Laerti]]) climbed up out of the well, and slaughtered the greater part of the sleeping tribe. Only a few children (who had camped outside the walls because they were afraid to sleep in a place of so much stone) escaped, and the [[Laerti]] pursued them until the full desert sunlight rose over the sands, savaging and devouring any whose galloping camels slowed or stumbled.

[[Laerti]] still lair in the caverns beneath the city, caverns ruled by [[The Phaerimm|the Phaerimm]], who will direct forces of up to seven hundred [[Laerti]] to pursue and slay anyone who finds this entry to their underground realm.
