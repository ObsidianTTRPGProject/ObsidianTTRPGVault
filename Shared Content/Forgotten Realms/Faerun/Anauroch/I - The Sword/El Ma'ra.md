# El Ma'ra
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

This small but verdant oasis is named for, and marked by, El Mara Dat-ur Ojhogo (The tall god who lets men sit upon his head: see The Gods of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]), a single, 100-tall spire of yellow sandstone. El Mara stands a mile outside the oasis that bears its name. Encamped Bedine use the flat-topped spire as a lookout-place, their guards climbing up and down by means of ropes, and keeping watch armed and with mouth-blown alarm horns. A fall from the spire will kill most men. This was the favored oasis of the Qahtan tribe, until they were exterminated by [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] and their laerti allies.
