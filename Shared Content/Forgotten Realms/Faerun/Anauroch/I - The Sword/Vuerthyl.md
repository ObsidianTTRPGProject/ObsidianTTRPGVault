## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

A well-watered oasis of fruit trees and acacias, recently created by [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] (see Created Oases, earlier in this chapter). Extensive underground storage cellars are located here, cut out of the solid interior of a rock mesa that rises to the south of the bolson where [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] set their decanter of endless water In their excavations, [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] cut into a rich beryl gemstone vein, which yields beautifully-hued, clear emeralds of large size (most are about the size of a warriors fist). They also cut into an ancient tomb, where a mummified body promptly collapsed into dust. Some Zhent agents stole certain items of ancient magic from this place, and hid them from their comrades, elsewhere in the oasis. (DMs note: these items are not specified here; use this as an opportunity to introduce magic of your own choiceperhaps new magic, of your own designinto play.)

The Zhents, who employed magic to do their digging, also unwittingly freed a powerful wizard from imprisonment: a very old and evil mind flayer, who is also a 23rd level wizard. This being, Oedachlo, is lurking about the oasis, concealed by his powerful magic, until he can learn more about where he is, and what is going on in the Realms today. He may tag along with a powerful party of adventurers, keeping out of their sight, to reach more civilized and hospitable areas. He will then start searching for the human wizard who imprisoned him or the wizards descendantsto take vengeance. (Just who that human wizard is remains up to the DM.) The oasis has a guard of lowlevel Zhentarim wizards and priests, and twenty-six Zhentilar warriors, all veterans of 4th level or greater, who react instantly to attacks and strange occurences, and who work well together.

The only trap that the oasis has is a richlypanelled wizards storeroom at the back of the barracks, which is filled with a crystal ball, powerful-looking wands and rods, and rows of potion flasks. All of these things are dummies: but the entire room will be filled by a blade barrier spell whenever a certain word of activation is spoken in one of the adjacent rooms (where Zhentarim watchers are usually posted, able to look into the storeroom via spy holes).

If a particularly strong foe is in the trap, a second word will cause a `dice: 7d6`-damage fireball to explode halfway down the 60-long, straight stone corridor that leads down one side of the barracks to the storeroom. This is usually used against a party that is fleeing the blade barrier, or standing and watching its effects. Some of the Zhent wizards have minor trap magical items (left up to the DM), which they might place in the storeroom after its traps have been triggered, to catch a foe who returns thinking the places fangs have now been drawn, and it is safe to plunder.
