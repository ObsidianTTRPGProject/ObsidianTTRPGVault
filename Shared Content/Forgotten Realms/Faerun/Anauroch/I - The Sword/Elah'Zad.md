## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

This out-of-the-way oasis is sacred to [[The Bedine|the Bedine]]. Its name means House of the Moon, and that is also the name of the temple it holds.

The oasis well-hidden in a formidable maze of salt flats and rocky hills. It is not an easy place for an invader to reach or to attack.

A seemingly-endless chain of thousand-foothigh knolls slopes at last down into a small basin entirely surrounded by grayish ridges. Over a hundred small springs well up on the basins sides and trickle down its gentle slopes. Crimson-leaved shrubs with blue stems and twiggy trees with copper and silver sprigs border each stream, forming vividly colored bands of vegetation that are strung about the basin like an immense spider web, each strand following a life-giving stream down the hill to a central lake, encircled by lush grass. This sapphire-hued lake covers a full mile of the Sacred Grove at the bottom of the basin. In the center of the lake is a small, grassy island, and on the island stands an alabaster palace, built in the shape of a three-quarters moon: the House of the Moon. [[The Bedine]] cross this lake by means of two round boats of their own making. These low, clumsy craft are fashioned of camel hide stretched over wooden frames; their stitched seams let in streams of water.

The island is a small, grass-covered hill no more than a hundred yards across, topped by the three-quarter circle of the alabaster palace. The House is made of a chalky, translucent desert rock cut so thin that anyone standing on the island can see the shapes of a throne and chairs inside, through the walls. it is entered through a gracefully curved foyer, carved from a single piece of stone shaped without any visible joints.

The foyer opens into a circular room. A huge throne covered with hammered copper sits at the far side of the room, flanked on either side by a row of stout chairs carved of dark wood. The floor is marble so black that it seems a bottomless pit; the ceiling is a single slab of translucent stone that filters sunlight into the chamber as a warm, creamy radiance. Blood spilled in the room vanishes into the black marble without a trace.

The House of the Moon is as old as the gods, and stood before the Scattering. The goddess Eldath can choose to speak through the mouth of any woman who enters it (the woman falls asleep, and the goddess directly and completely controls her body). According to [[The Bedine|the Bedine]], Elahzad was the home of the moon goddess ([[Elah (Selune)|Elah]], or Selune), but Atar (the sun goddess) drove her away and made it a prison for Eldath, the Mother of the Waters, because she was jealous of Eldaths beauty. Camels are not allowed to drink of the sacred waters (the streams and waters, where [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] believe that Eldath dwells); a separate camel well is provided for them. DMs should consider this a place of power for Eldath, arid treat it as a temple for priests dedicated to her, wherein magical items can be recharged, faithful beings healed and cured of diseases, poisons, and mental or magical afflictions, at the DMs option.

If a DM has access to the module FA1/Halls of the High King consider The Sacred Grove to function as a Major Grove does, with all nine listed major grove powers, for priests and faithful of Eldath and Selune. The waters of the lake will have all the powers of a Moonwell except that of corroding metal; powers that are given in that appendix as being exercised by a druid or other cleric of Chauntea function only for clergy of Eldath and Selune.
