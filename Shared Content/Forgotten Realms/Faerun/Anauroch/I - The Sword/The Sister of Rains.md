# The Sister of Rains
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

This ancient oasis is isolated from most Bedine by the dreaded Shoal of Thirst. Here outcasts, such as Bedine wizards, may dwell unmolested. The witch Qohadar, for example, raised and trained the witch Ruha here.

The Sister of Rains oasis lies at the base of the largest peak in the mountain range known as [[The Wall of Fallen Djinn|the Wall of Fallen Djinn]] (see below). It is reached by traveling up a large plantstudded wadi, home to many hares. As one travels upwards, the sand walls rise into rocky cliffs, and grass carpets the sand. Then one comes to an ancient stone wall, fifteen feet high and stretching across the entire canyon. A rusty gate of iron opens in its center, flanked by several huge breaches broken by rare floods. The wall is the work of a now-forgotten, long-vanished Bedine tribe who once dwelt here. They also left behind a tower, long since fallen. On the northern side of the canyon is a wide, 30 high ledge where the tower once stood. Most of its stones are scattered and halfburied, but the foundation is still intact.

In one corner of it, a corner usually filled with blown sand, is a stone trapdoor. Beneath it is a spiderweb-shrouded, cramped pit, which opens into a bat-infested corridor. To the left, it runs to a hidden entrance down the canyon, near its northern wall (this is how the bats get in and out). To the right, the corridor ends in an old vault. [[The Bedine]] sorceress Ruha hid a spellbook here for years, in a box of sun-fired clay.

On the southern wall of the canyon, across from where the tower stood, a dozen springs spill out of the rock and cascade down the cliffface, to collect in little pools. These tiny waterfalls are the Sister of Rains. Their water gives life to dozens of fig trees and a wild thicket of fruit-bearing plants (once a tended grove). Human skeletons and graves are both scattered about the canyon, which rises into a blind end beyond the tower.
