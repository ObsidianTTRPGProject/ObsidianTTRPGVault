# The Scimitar Spires
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Mountains, Hills
#Geographical-Region/Mountains #Geographical-Region/Hills

The western edge of Atars Looking Glass is marked by a line of obelisk-like rocky spires, that look like the teeth of some gigantic earthbound monsteror, as [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] name for them implies, like so many swords buried hilt-deep in the sand, only their upright blades protruding. The hulking spires rise out of dusty sand in a labyrinthine forest of stone without foothills, ravines, or any visible water and plants. The mountains simply soar sharply up from the sand.

Few Bedine know the ways through this dry barrier of soaring stone; few have explored the Spires. But those who do can find their way through the Spires in at least two places (the Gap of Skulls and the Road of Jackals), and can also find, between two of the Spires, the narrow, unmarked gap that is the upper end of the descending canyon known at its far, lower end as the Chasm (see [[The Well of the Chasm]], below). A certain wishbone-shaped spire is the landmark for the Chasm entrance. Less than two hundred yards from it is a flat-topped rock outcrop, and at its southern end is a 9-wide gap: the Mouth of the Abyss, the beginning of the narrow, winding canyon that descends to [[The Well of the Chasm|the Well of the Chasm]].
