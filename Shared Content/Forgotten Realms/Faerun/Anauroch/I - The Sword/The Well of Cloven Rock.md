# The Well of Cloven Rock
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Valley
#Geographical-Region/Valley

Amid [[The Hills of Scent|the Hills of Scent]] (see above), no more than sixty miles from sacred Elahzad (see above) is a large, well-known oasis. A natural bowl-shaped valley amid the countless hills studded with frankincense trees contains a grassy meadow and several thickets of wild trees of all sorts. At the center of this meadow, is the Cloven Rock itself: a large tor, riven in two, out of which gushes a spring. The spring spills out into a long, narrow lake, shaped like a curving swordblade, that cuts across the meadow to its edge, where it drains into a little stream that wanders all around the outside of the grassy bowl. There is a well here, too: a relic of times before the spring found the surface, when water had to be drawn up laboriously from a deep cave.

Lions make this oasis their home, hunting in the surrounding hills. Bedine arriving here to camp always send in a hunting-party to slay or drive out the lions first, and post doubled guards armed with spears as well as bows and their personal swords, all the time they are encamped.
