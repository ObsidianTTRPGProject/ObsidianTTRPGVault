#Geographical-Region/River #Geographical-Region/Canyon #Geographical-Region/Other #Geographical-Region/Caves

[[The River of Gems]] runs from the edge of the Ice Wall to The Throat, a huge, circular crater or sinkhole on the edge of [[I - The Sword|The Sword]]. The Throat is about three miles across, and is home to thousands of desert birds (such as vultures) who nest on its steep slopes. The Throats deep blue waters are said to hold heaps of gemstones, rounded by their passage down the river, and also said to hide the bones of more than one overeager adventurer, who fell afoul of whatever aquatic monsters lurk in The Throat. These might be water nagas, or freshwater morkoths, or kelpies, or something else . . . the tales of survivors who made it back out to tell of their experiences have been too fearful and garbled to be sure.
