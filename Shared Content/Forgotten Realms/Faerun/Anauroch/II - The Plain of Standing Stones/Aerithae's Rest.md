# Aerithae's Rest
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Valley
#Geographical-Region/Valley

Named for the long-ago adventuress who discovered it (and nursed her battered band of adventurers back to health, to sally forth and slay the orcs theyd been fleeing), this verdant valley is about three miles long and a mile wide, and consists of a deep, clearwater central lake (fed by an underground spring that wells up into it), surrounded by a thick, tangled forest that entirely fills the earthen bowl valley, and climbs a good way up the sheer rock walls that enclose it.

Foxes, raccoons, scramble-squirrels, and bears roam this tiny paradise; vultures avoid it because of eagles that lair above the valley.

Aerithaes Rest is hard to find; it lies between two knife-sharp ridges, that join in a threepointed peak to the south. On this peaks crest the eagles lair, and in its base are at least three caves, one of which is home to the bears. Hard climbing is necessary to get into or out of the Rest, but the ridges and ravines around it hold several known rockfaces where iron-rich ore and nuggets can be mined with only a hammer.

There are persistent rumors of an entrance to the Underdark, hidden somewhere in the Rest-and recently, an adventurers tale of battling gargoyles in the Rest has come to the inns and taverns of the Dragonreach.
