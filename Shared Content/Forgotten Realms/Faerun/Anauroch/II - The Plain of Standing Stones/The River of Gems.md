# The River of Gems
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: River
#Geographical-Region/River

Clearwater river that runs from the edge of the Ice Wall (the northerns edge of the Plain, and southern edge of [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]]) to a sinkhole or huge crater on the edge of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]] called "[[The Throat|the Throat]]".

Its route is one long, snaking gorge; the river is a shallow, sluggish flow trickling along the gorge bottom, which is home to many scrub plants and stunted trees. Both gorge and riverbed are studded with many gemstones. A traveler lucky enough to reach the river can scoop up a fortune in half a day of scrambling around in the gorge (of course, getting it back to buyers is not so easy . . .). Dark cavemouths open here and there along the gorge, leading to the depths of the Underdark, beneath [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. Giant bats lair within, waiting for greedy intruders to come into the gorge. They are not the worst predators of the gorge. Legends of the River are spread by mind-controlled agents of [[The Phaerimm|the Phaerimm]], to get [[The Phaerimm|the Phaerimm]] a steady supply of slaves and food. By night, or when intruders enter the caves, servant creatures of [[The Phaerimm|the Phaerimm]] will attack, heedless of their own safety. At about midpoint in its flow, the river curls around a rocky pinnacle known as [[Heroes' Helm|Heroes Helm]].
