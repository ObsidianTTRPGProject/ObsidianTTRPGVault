# The Swordpoint
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Mountains
#Geographical-Region/Mountains

This distinctive peak is a useful landmark: its soaring, clean-lined needle shape is unmistakeable from afar. Manticores are known to lair nearby, drinking at several natural wells (water-filled sinkholes) around the base of the Swordpoint. Intruders trying to use one of these watersources are likely to face a manticore ambush.
