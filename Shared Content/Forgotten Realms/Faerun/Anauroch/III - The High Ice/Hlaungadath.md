# Hlaungadath
## Overview
Due east of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch/III - The High Ice/Ascore]], perhaps forty miles into the desert, another city rises out of the sands. This one is old but largely intact; long cracks lace its spired towers, and here and there a dome has fallen to winter snowloads or howling windstorms. This onetime independent human city is inhabited, and kept more or less in repair. It is now a community of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]], who dwell here in warped luxury, amid wines, clothes, apparati, and magics scavenged from Netherese ruins over the years. The city holds great riches, but these are little cared for; one escaped human captive spoke of gems tossed carelessly into corners like so many marbles, and magic armor piled in lightless, spiderwebshrouded storerooms. Perhaps ninety [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]] dwell here, ruled by over twenty [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]] nobles.

Armed with Netherese magical items (such as ropes of entanglement and wands of paralyzation), these nobles sally forth from the city in human form, whenever [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]] patrols report intruders in the area. The nobles attempt to capture the intruders by magic and deception, and bring them to the city. In the labyrinthine depths of Hlaungadaths lightless cellars and storage caverns, the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]] keep a breeding colony of human slaves, to which all captives are added. [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia]] live on the cooked flesh of their slaves, especially prizing babies, but taking care not to overeat from the herd (depleting ranks and quality). Ambitious nobles work on schemes for raids out of the desert, to take food-slaves from orc holds in the nearby mountains, and carry off whatever dwarves and humans they can find. In the sands just west of Hlaungadath lies a crashed ship of the skies. (For DMs interested in SPELLJAMMER campaigns, this is a galleon, its bow hopelessly smashed, but with an intact minor helm aboard. It cannot sail on water without extensive repairs, but its sturdy frame will serve for aerial voyages as long as major storms and collisions are avoided.) Its crew are long gone (fled or eaten, along with the cargo), and its origin and ownership forgotten.

The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]] know of its past use, and keep a watch over it as they search through all the records they can find, to learn how to make it fly (they simply dont realize the helm is what takes it aloft). They plan to use it for food-slave raids over the Sword Coast lands to the west, and in water-gathering expeditions to the southwest, to the rivers and marshes they know to be there. Adventurers who see the ship may figure out its power if they are familiar with other aerial ships of the Realms; the nose-down galleon, heeled over in the sand, is still tethered to the top of a high tower of the city by its long anchor-chain.
