# The Frozen Sea
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Hills, Plains
#Geographical-Region/Hills #Geographical-Region/Plains

On the western edge of [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]] the ice fails, giving way to frozen sands. Here, in ancient days, the Narrow Sea lay like a sword, running north and south along what is now the Desertsedge. Its basin is now filled with a wind-sculpted, desolate labyrinth of frozen sand dunes, marked here and there by the diggings of bold explorers who come seeking the riches of the lost port cities-and the lairs of those creatures who prey on such fools.

This region, called by some the Frozen Sea (due to its past; the present-day explorer will search in vain for any water or ice), is a breeding-ground for many birds in spring, when ground-hugging plants appear and briefly flourish. Little other life is readily apparent here to untrained eyes.

The Frozen Sea holds certain features of interest to adventurers, including the ruined cities of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch/III - The High Ice/Ascore]], [[Hlaungadath]], and [[Oreme]].
