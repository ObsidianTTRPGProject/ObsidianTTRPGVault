# The Rift of Stars
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Canyon
#Geographical-Region/Canyon

There are many rifts, or large crevasses, in the surface of the seemingly-endless sheet of High Ice. Many are as large as good-sized river valleys, and all offer some shelter from the howling winds; most are home to something. Several are distinctive enough to deserve special mention. The Rift of Stars is one such. It is large but narrow, running for many miles northeast and southwest in the ice. The riven ice here reveals a corresponding gash or cleft in the underlying rock, so that ice gives way to rocky walls. These are studded with beljurils: those strange, fist-sized gemstones of Faerun that periodically emit a cold flash of light. By day, the Rift may seem alive with moving, winking reflections, but at night, it is an awesomely beautiful, evershifting tapestry of glittering lights (from which it gained its name).

Many adventurers embark on the long Road to the Rift, made famous by caravanmerchants of Amn, down on their luck, who came up with a ballad about the Road of Gems that would make them all rich. The Rift is studded with a wealth of natural gemstone outcroppings, bristling amid the beljurils in a natural, fantastic lode of lodes that can make the lucky prospectors who reach it-and make it to far-off gem markets alive-very, very rich. Travelers in [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]] have even made fortunes coming upon sacks of rough-hewn rubies, sapphires, bejurils, and chunks of amaratha (both of these last two gemstones are detailed fully in the FORGOTTEN REALMS® Adventures hardcover sourcebook) abandoned by dead adventurers-or still grimly held by their dead or undead remains.

There is too little food, warmth, and water for anything to live in the Rift for long, but it is visited often by High Ice predators.

The Rift contains many tiny caves and hollows, gouged out by eager miners over the years, and these may provide temporary shelter, and yield meltwater when a sunny day follows a snowfall. Bright sun turns the Rift into a blaze of reflections equal in effects to heat shimmer (see the chapter on Dangers of the Desert), and also causes cracking, singing sounds as the gem-laden, crystalline rocks heat up. In prolonged periods of sunlight, it is possible for unclad humans to sunbathe or even roast in the sun, draped in the right areas of the Rift.
