# The Smokeholes
## Overview
**Type**: Cavern, Other
#Adventure-Area/Cavern #Adventure-Area/Other

These large, round holes are eternally shrouded in cloud-like plumes of steam, created by the hot air that has melted through the ice here meeting the frigid upper air. The Smokeholes are vents for hot, steaming, moaning air rising from underground caverns where ice meets lava flows. The hellish spaces below the ice here are known as the Caverns of Burning Ice, and particularly bold (or, if you prefer, stupid) gnomes and dwarves have mounted perilous expeditions to reach them, to forge or derive metals for the making of splendid weapons. Scalding jets of steam and noxious underearth gases make descents into the Smokeholes or the Caverns below dangerous indeed: when characters are in these areas, roll `dice: 1d12` once every three rounds. On a result of 1 or 2, apply natural effects equal to a cloudkill spell to a randomly-determined area.

Salamanders and other heat-loving monsters are said to lurk in the Caverns of Burning Ice, and dragons are known to lair in nearby grottoes warmed by hot gas escaping through tiny vents in the rock. Just how extensive the Caverns are, and what other creatures may benefit from their warmth, is not known to the surface Realms.
