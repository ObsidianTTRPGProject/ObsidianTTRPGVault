# LLashloch (The Lake of Ice)
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Glacier
#Geographical-Region/Glacier

Another large glacial rift is shaped like a bent human arm. Its glistening, treacherous ice slopes descend to a lake of ice floes and steamy plumes. Hot springs bubble up from the depths of the earth here, and have melted a rift that almost freezes over, but whose icy crust never quite hardens entirely. Instead, a shifting tangle of canted, wind-sculpted ice floes covers the tepid waters that are home to many large fish and things like white-skinned coldwater octopi. The chance of good meals brings many High Ice predators (and intruders) down into the rift where they feed and are fed upon by denizens of the depths, other hungry visitors, and, some say, ice-dwelling snow cloakers: a species of white-skinned cloakers (detailed in Volume 3 of t h e Monstrous Compendium, t h e f i r s t FORGOTTEN REALMS® appendix) who dwell in the rift and nearby crevasses, and fly silently out over the lake to hunt.
