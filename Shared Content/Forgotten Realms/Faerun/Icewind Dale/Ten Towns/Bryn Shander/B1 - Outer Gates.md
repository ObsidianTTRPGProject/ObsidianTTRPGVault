# B1 - Outer Gates
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The [[G6 - Town|town]] has three sets of 15-foot-high hinged wooden gates, dubbed the North Gate, the East Gate, and the Southwest Gate. These gates can be barred from the inside with heavy, iron-banded hardwood beams. Barred gates have AC 15, 200 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Forcing open a set of barred gates requires a successful DC 28 Strength check.

Two 30-foot-tall cylindrical stone towers flank each gate and watch over one of the trails that lead to and from the [[G6 - Town|town]]. The trail from the North Gate travels two miles north to the village ofTargos on the frozen shore of a lake called Maer Dualdon. The trail leading east, called the Eastway, stretches roughly thirteen miles to the [[G6 - Town|town]] of Easthaven on the shore of Lac Dinneshere. The southwest route, known as the Caravan Trail, is called the [[Ten Trail]] where it passes through the [[Spine of the World]]. This trail is the safest way to the lands south of the mountains, but it is nigh impassable in the winter.

Under normal circumstances, the gates of [[Bryn Shander]] stand open, and the guards assigned to the gatehouses say and do nothing as people come and go. When [[Bryn Shander]] is threatened, however, the guards close and bar the gates, refusing to open them unless ordered to do so by the sheriff or the speaker. There are four guards at each gate at any given time. Another eight guards are on patrol, moving between the stone watchtowers along the wall. Most of the guards are human, with a sprinkling of shield dwarves, half-ores, and other races.

A sheriff's deputy named **Augrek Brighthelm** (see appendix D) often stands watch at the southwest gate. She delights in greeting first-time visitors to [[G6 - Town|town]]. In fact, she has a well-rehearsed speech that makes some of the other guards at the gate roll their eyes: "Well met, travelers! Keep yer fingers and extremities under wraps, lest Auril bite them off! Mind yer tempers, and you'll be most welcome here! Brought goods to sell? The market lies straight ahead. Craving a warm drink? May I recommend a drop ofFirebeard's Firebrandy, sold only at [[B8 - Kelvin's Comfort|Kelvin's Comfort]], located on yer right as you enter the market square!" (If the characters arrive at a different gate, you can relocate Augrek to that gate.)
