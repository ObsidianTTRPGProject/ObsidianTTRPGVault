# B13 - The Northlook
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The Northlook is the inn most frequented by mercenaries and adventurers, and as such it's the rowdiest and most dangerous place to stay in [[Bryn Shander]]. At the same time, its taproom is the best place in all of [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]] to get the latest news and rumors, including leads on profitable ventures. The proprietor, a retired sellsword who goes by the name Scramsax (N male Illuskan human **veteran**), takes advantage of the high hopes and good fortunes of his customers by charging the most exorbitant rates in [[G6 - Town|town]]. (His prices for room and board are double those listed in the Player's Handbook.) Scramsax often cuts a break for customers who are between jobs, allowing them to stay on credit and then presenting them with a bill inflated by interest charges after they earn their next payday. Those who don't settle their accounts discover that the former mercenary doesn't take "no money" for an answer, and he still remembers how to handle a blade.
