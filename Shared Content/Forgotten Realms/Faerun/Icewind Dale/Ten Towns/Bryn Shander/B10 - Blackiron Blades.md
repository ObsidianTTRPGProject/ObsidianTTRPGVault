# B10 - Blackiron Blades
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

This small shop and smithy stands just north of the [[G6 - Town|town]] square and is well known as a one-stop shop for adventurers and other travelers in the region. Rather than attempting to compete with the dwarf-crafted weapons from Kelvin's Cairn, the smith, Garn (N male Illuskan human **commoner**), makes his living by manufacturing the cheapest blades in [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]]. His sister, Elza (NG female Illuskan human **commoner**), runs the shop. Elza has expanded the business in recent years by offering a selection of adventuring supplies-rations, fur cloaks, leather gloves and boots, ice picks, snowshoes, and other survival gear. While a Blackiron weapon typically sells for half the price listed in the *Player's Handbook*, Elza marks up other goods by 50 percent to keep the business profitable. Most of the [[G6 - Town|town]]'s veteran sellswords disdain Garn's smithcraft, and jokes told about hapless newcomers to lcewind Dale often end with the line " ... an' 'e was carryin' a Blackiron blade, to boot!"
