# Restoring Harmony: A Sticky Situation
Welcome to Restoring Harmony, a Dungeons & Dragons adventure series in collaboration with the tasty and colorful world of NERDS.

Restoring Harmony is a campaign that's divided into six 1st-level mini adventures for a solo player and one longer adventure for multiple players. Each mini adventure takes approximately 45 minutes to play and the final adventure takes approximately 60–90 minutes to play.

### Story Summary
Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.

To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more.

But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.

The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!

### Solo Play
Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.

You can also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes on rolls, having monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.

#### TPK: Total Party Kill
In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd *potion of healing* lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.

In the case of an untimely death, you can have a helpful NPC (like Mr. Honeycutt) save the day and revive them, or you can have them forego death saving throws and wake up as they're being dragged someplace unpleasant.

### Adventure Outline
Here is a quick overview of the adventure:

- Orange the Fighter gets jumped in his martial arts school by a couple of goons who've been sent to take him out.
- After the fight, Orange meets Mr. Honeycutt, the Magister of the Lorekeeper Society. Mr. Honeycutt asks Orange to find the Peach Gem located in a ruined mausoleum.
- Orange goes to the mausoleum and must defeat a gelatinous cube which has engulfed the gem into its acidic body.
- Orange returns to Mr. Honeycutt with the gem.

### Beginning Play
Hand the character sheet (see "Orange the Fighter," below) to your player and let them familiarize themselves with Orange.

All creatures or NPCs that are bolded have stat blocks, which are included at the end of the adventure along with any magic items the characters can earn.

Whenever you're both ready, you can start the session.

## A Sticky Situation
Begin play in the sparring room of the Critical Strike Combat School where Orange is exercising and practicing various skills with the sword. In the training room, Orange has access to one energy drink which acts as a *potion of healing*.

When everyone's ready, read the following:

>>You're at the gym early in the morning before the students arrive, getting in an hour of training when two tough-looking goons swagger into the room. One locks the door behind them as the other sneers at you. They have swords, and you can tell instantly that they aren't blunted for training.
>>
>>"Time for a little candy-coated nap!" one goon says with a gap-toothed grin.
>>

The two **goons** begin swaggering up to Orange, ready for a fight. They've been sent by Mr. Graystone to capture or kill Orange. Emo the Beholder has seen how Mr. Honeycutt is recruiting all the heroes in Harmony to look for the Gems of Power, and they want to put an end to Honeycutt's chances of foiling their master plan.

Orange can try intimidating the two toughs, but it'll be difficult as they're fairly determined to carry out their grim task. To intimidate them, Orange must make a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check followed by a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to show just how powerful they are. If both checks succeed, the goons run off, leaving their swords behind.

If Orange takes the goons alive, they won't talk or reveal who sent them unless Orange makes a successful DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check. If Orange gets them to talk, they explain they were hired to kill Orange by a huge, shadowy man who wore a gray overcoat and spoke in an icy whisper.

If Orange gets into trouble during the fight with the goons, have a warrior from the Lorekeeper Society (a **guard**) who's a former student of Orange's kick down the door and come to the rescue.

If Orange gets knocked out by dropping to 0 hit points, they wake up to find Mr. Honeycutt looking over them.

### Meeting Mr. Honeycutt
If Orange defeats the goons, **Mr. Honeycutt** arrives just after, hoping to warn Orange of the impending fight.

If the goons defeat Orange, Mr. Honeycutt arrives just in time to drive them off and resuscitate Orange. Either way, Mr. Honeycutt introduces himself as the leader of the secret Lorekeeper Society—the ancestral guardians of Harmony. He believes nefarious forces are at work, attempting to steal the color from Harmony and use it for their own gain, robbing the color from the world as they do so. To save Harmony, Mr. Honeycutt first needs to collect six Gems of Power, and he hopes Orange can help him get the Peach Gem.

#### The Mission
After much research, Mr. Honeycutt says he's finally ascertained where the Peach Gem is: it's hidden in a ruined mausoleum notorious for monster activity. He needs a fighter like Orange to go into the mausoleum, return the gem to the Lorekeeper Society, and help him solve the mystery of the color outages.

If Orange agrees to help, Mr. Honeycutt offers a reward of 20 gp for the return of the gem. He also gives Orange a *necklace of fireballs* with one bead remaining. As he gives the item to Orange, Mr. Honeycutt says, "I hope you never have to use this."

## Ruined Mausoleum
Deep in the forest outside of Harmony lie the ruins of a mausoleum. When Orange arrives read the following:

>>You see a crumbling building being reclaimed by the forest. Stone walls poke through the vegetation and the courtyard's flagstones are covered with leaves and broken by tree roots.
>>
>>Oddly, the birds don't sing here which makes the area unnaturally quiet.
>>

The entrance (area M1) can be found with a quick search inside the collapsed walls of the mausoleum. Sweeping aside a thick covering of vines, Orange finds an iron-barred gate with an old, rusted padlock. Breaking the padlock requires a successful DC 12 Strength check. If Orange has a tool, like a crowbar, or uses a creative way to open the padlock, they have advantage on the check.

All the doors in the mausoleum are made of rotting wood. They have AC 10, 8 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

### Exploring the Mausoleum
The following locations are keyed to the Ruined Mausoleum map:

![[006.webp|right|300]]

### M1. Entrance
When Orange opens the gate, read the following.

>>You see a stone staircase descending down into darkness. Thin root tendrils hang from the ceiling and the moss-covered walls glisten and drip.
>>

The staircase leads down to a corridor that ends in a rotting wood door which can be easily opened or broken down. However, lurking on the ceiling of this corridor is a **gray ooze**.

***Monster Tactics.*** The gray ooze uses its False Appearance trait to blend in with the tunnel's wet stone walls. When a creature approaches within 60 feet of the gray ooze, it senses its next snack and either waits for its target to come within reach of a pseudopod or begins a slow pursuit.

Defeating the gray ooze isn't essential to move on, but its ability to corrode metal provides a taste of what's to come deeper in the mausoleum. This encounter is an opportunity for Orange to learn about Oozes firsthand and to devise tactics against them.

### M2. Mausoleum
When Orange steps into this area, read the following:

>>The walls are covered with trails of slime, some of which drips on the floor and forms slick pools. Four alcoves, each with a rotted wood door, line the corridor.
>>

***Dimensions and Terrain.*** Each tomb (A–D) is a 10-foot-wide, 15-foot-long room with a stone sarcophagus at the far end. Due to the slippery nature of the slime, the floors are considered difficult terrain.

#### Tomb A
If Orange listens at the door to this tomb before opening it, they hear tapping or clacking sounds. Opening the door reveals two **skeletons** repeatedly bumping into each other. When the door opens, they attack.

If Orange's weapons have rusted due to the encounter with the gray ooze, the fighter can loot the skeletons' shortswords.

***Sarcophagus Inscription.*** The inscription reads: "Two warriors, so great was their love, they were buried together."

#### Tomb B
If Orange opens this tomb, they find a skeleton surrounded by hard candies in wax paper wrappers. The skeleton has a parchment closed with a wax seal clutched in its hand. On the parchment is the long-lost recipe for Professor Fizzwidget's famous tart and tangy candies.

***Sarcophagus Inscription.*** The inscription reads: "Here lies Professor Fizzwidget, inventor of sweet candy treats for all of Harmony."

#### Tomb C
When Orange opens the door to this tomb, read:

>>Hovering in the middle of the tunnel is an assortment of trinkets, equipment, and bones. An odd, shimmering surface reveals a gelatinous form filling the passageway wall-to-wall.
>>

Orange has discovered a **gelatinous cube** that's behaving oddly!

***Encounter Adjustments.*** The gelatinous cube is weakened from its attempts to digest the Peach Gem and a magic sword, both of which it has engulfed. When Orange discovers the **gelatinous cube**, it only has 40 hit points remaining and it doesn't have its Transparent trait.

***Defeating the Cube.*** Even in its weakened stat, a gelatinous cube is no easy task. Hopefully, Orange uses the last bead of the necklace of fireballs to finish off the cube. If that doesn't work, have **Mr. Honeycutt** arrive with four **guards** to help Orange defeat the cube. Have the cube attack the guards first before attacking Mr. Honeycutt or Orange.

***Monster Tactics.*** The gelatinous cube is a floor-toceiling blob. Due to its digestive issues, this one is a sickly green. Regardless, its pseudopods sweep out in search of more things to digest, slow-moving like a street sweeper. If it senses a living creature, it moves toward them at full speed and uses its Engulf action as soon as it can.

If Orange is engulfed, the fighter can attempt to grab items from within the gelatinous cube. Roll a d6 (rerolling duplicates) to determine what Orange retrieves from the table below:

##### Gelatinous Cube Treasures
| d6 | Treasure |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | *+1 greatsword* |
| 2 | *Potion of healing* |
| 3 | *Ring of protection* |
| 4 | Two metal gambling dice |
| 5 | The Peach Gem |
| 6 | Brass bell |

When the gelatinous cube is reduced to 24 hit points or fewer, it spits out the *+1 greatsword*, the *potion of healing*, and the glowing orange gem (the Peach Gem), and makes its retreat by dashing away.

***Sarcophagus Inscription.*** The sarcophagus and its inscriptions have been scratched off.

#### Tomb D
Inside the sarcophagus, the robed skeleton of the librarian lies in repose, holding a parchment across their chest. The parchment is a scroll of protection (aberrations).

***Sarcophagus Inscription.*** "Here lies the First Librarian of the Great Library of Harmony."

### Completing the Mission
Arriving back in Harmony, Orange is invited to meet with Mr. Honeycutt at the local tavern. On return of the Peach Gem, Mr. Honeycutt is visibly relieved. He offers Orange membership in the Lorekeeper Society and asks if Orange will help him put an end to those who'd steal the color from Harmony. He's close to figuring out who's behind the color outages and feels as if he's going to need the help of heroes to stop them.
