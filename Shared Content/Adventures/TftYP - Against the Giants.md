# Preface
Welcome to *Tales from the Yawning Portal*. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.

Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.

- A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.
- A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.
- A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.

These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerûn and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.

The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.

### Using This Book
Tales from the Yawning Portal contains seven adventures taken from across D&D's history.

The introduction of each adventure provides ideas on adapting it to a variety of D&D settings. Use that information to place it in your campaign or to give you an idea of how to adapt it.

These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as *Storm King's Thunder*, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.

### About the Adventures

#### The Sunless Citadel
*The Sunless Citadel,* written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.

Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Citadel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. It's also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.

#### The Forge of Fury
*The Forge of Fury,* written by Richard Baker, was published in 2000 shortly after The Sunless Citadel. Characters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a ruined dwarven fortress.

Like its predecessor, *The Forge of Fury* is tailored to provide increasingly tougher threats as the characters make their way through the fortress. Those who survive the experience can expect to advance to 5th level—seasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory and renown.

#### The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan
*The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,* written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title *Lost Tamoachan* at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.

The updated version of the adventure presented herein is designed for a group of four or five 5th-level player characters.

#### White Plume Mountain
Lawrence Schick, the author of *White Plume Mountain*, related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he get the job, but *White Plume* became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.

The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.

#### Dead in Thay
*Dead in Thay,* written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was created when the fifth edition D&D game was in the testing stages. In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to *Tomb of Horrors, Ruins of Undermountain*, and other "killer dungeons" throughout the history of the game.

The version of *Dead in Thay* presented here is modified for use in home campaigns. It is designed for characters of 9th to 11th level.

#### Against the Giants
The three linked adventures that make up *Against the Giants* were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the *Player's Handbook* for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.

The compilation of *Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl*, and *Hall of the Fire Giant King* was published in 1981 as *Against the Giants*. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.

#### Tomb of Horrors
Before there was much of anything else in the world of the D&D game, there was the *Tomb of Horrors*.

The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of *Tomb of Horrors*, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.

As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.

### Running the Adventures
To run each of these adventures, you need the fifth edition *Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*. Before you sit down with your players, read the text of the adventure all the way through and familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps making notes about complex areas or places where the characters are certain to go, so you're well prepared before the action starts.

>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
>

The *Monster Manual* contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in appendix B. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure's text tells you so.

Spells and nonmagical objects or equipment mentioned in the book are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, unless the adventure's text directs you to an item's description in appendix A.

### Creating a Campaign
While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaign-over 30 years separates the newest from the oldest-they have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.

Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.

The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.

### The Yawning Portal
Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.

In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.

For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.

All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.

Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.

Adventurers from across Faerûn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.

#### The Green Dragon Inn
The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.

### Features of the Yawning Portal
The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The "well" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.

Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.

#### Entering the Well
Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to "ride the rope") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.

#### Oddities on Display
A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.

#### A Typical Evening
On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.

Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.

### Starting the Story
Kicking off a dungeon adventure can be as simple as having a mysterious stranger offer the characters a quest while they are at the Yawning Portal (or some other tavern). This approach is a cliché, but it is an effective one. Use the following two tables to generate a couple of details, then tailor the particulars of the quest and the quest giver to suit the adventure you plan to run.

##### Mysterious Stranger Quest
| d8 | Objective |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Recover a particular item |
| 2 | Find and return with an NPC or monster |
| 3 | Slay a terrible monster or NPC |
| 4 | Guard a person while they perform a ritual |
| 5 | Create an accurate map of part of the dungeon |
| 6 | Discover secret lore hidden in the dungeon |
| 7 | Destroy an object |
| 8 | Sanctify part of the dungeon to a god of good |

##### Mysterious Stranger Secret
| d8 | Secret |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Intends to betray the party |
| 2 | Unwittingly provides false information |
| 3 | Has a secret agenda (roll another quest) |
| 4 | Is a devil in disguise |
| 5 | Has led other parties to their doom |
| 6 | Is the charmed thrall of a mind flayer |
| 7 | Is possessed by a ghost |
| 8 | Is a solar in disguise |

#### Durnan
The proprietor of the Yawning Portal is something of an enigma. Blessed with a seemingly limitless life span by treasures he brought back from his expedition nearly two centuries ago, he is as much a fixture in the tap room as the well.

Durnan is a man of few words. He expects to be paid for his time, and will offer insight and rumors only in return for hard cash. "We know the odds and take our chances," he says, whether he is breaking up a card game that has turned violent or refusing the pleas of adventurers trapped at the bottom of the well who are unable to pay for a ride up. Despite his stony heart, he is an excellent source of information about Undermountain and other dungeons, provided one can pay his price.

![[Durnan.jpg|right|300]]

***Personality Trait: Isolation.*** It's a cruel world. All people have to fend for themselves. Self-sufficiency is the only path to success.

***Ideal: Independence.*** Someone who can stand alone can stand against anything.

***Bond: The Yawning Portal.*** This place is my only home. My friends and family are long gone. I love this place, but I try not to get attached to the people here. I'll outlive them all. Lucky me.

***Flaw: Heartless.*** If you want sympathy, the Temple of Ilmater is in the Sea Ward. No matter how bad things are, you'll be gone in a blink of an eye.

#### Other Denizens
The Yawning Portal is host to a variety of regular visitors, most of whom offer services to adventurers. Chapter 4 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* provides plenty of resources for generating nonplayer characters. The following table provides some possibilities for why an individual is visiting the Yawning Portal.

##### Denizens
| d10 | Denizen |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Devotee of Tymora, encourages adventures to seek out quests, can cast bless |
| 2 | Bored, retired adventurer, claims to have explored dungeon of note and can describe first few areas (20 percent chance of an accurate description) |
| 3 | Heckler, mocks cowards and makes bets that adventurers won't return from an expedition |
| 4 | Con artist, selling fake treasure maps (but a 10 percent chance that a map is genuine) |
| 5 | Wizard's apprentice, carefully making exact sketches of various curios at her master's command |
| 6 | Spouse of a slain adventurer, who pays the toll for anyone wanting to exit Undermountain and plots against Durnan |
| 7 | Zhentarim agent, seeks rumors of treasure, tails any folk who return from Undermountain and notes their home base for future robbery |
| 8 | Agent of the Xanathar, ordered to "steal the hat worn by the eighth person to enter the taproom this night" |
| 9 | Magically preserved corpse in a coffin leaning against the bar; if asked about it, Durnan says, "He's waiting for someone," and nothing more |
| 10 | Elminster, incognito; 10 percent chance he is on an errand of cosmic importance; otherwise, he's pressing Durnan for gossip |
---
# Against the Giants
Giants have been raiding civilized lands in bands, with giants of different sorts in these marauding groups. Death and destruction have been laid heavily upon every place these monsters have visited. This has caused great anger in high places, for life and property loss means failure of the vows of noble rulers to protect the life and goods of each and every subject—and possible lean times for the rulers as well as the ruled. Therefore, a party of the bravest and most powerful adventurers has been assembled and given the charge to punish the miscreant giants. Characters whose homes lay in the devastated land probably need little more motivation to face their oppressors.

The first stage of the characters' mission is an infiltration and assault of the *Steading of the Hill Giant Chief*. From there, if they succeed, the adventurers can advance to test their mettle against the even more formidable giants of frost and fire, but that is of no concern right now—the steading awaits, and its perils are plentiful.

## Running the Adventures
This is a series of three linked adventures. It is designed for a group of four or five player characters of 11th level. If the characters persevere, they are likely to advance in level at the end of each section of the story. Only strong and experienced characters should adventure into these giants' areas if the party consists of no more than four characters. The characters should have magic items to help them overcome the challenges they face. For a small party, the most important qualities are experience and caution. A group of four well-played characters can expect a reasonable chance of survival if they use their knowledge and cunning to best advantage.

These adventures were designed for strategic play, so some areas of the giant settlements are very dangerous even for characters of the recommended level. Further, adventurers who call too much attention to themselves are likely to be doomed. It takes only one or two extra giants in an encounter to turn a manageable situation into a very deadly one.

Therefore, be free with information the players need to make informed decisions. For example, any seasoned adventurer can see that the giants in the great hall of the steading represent an overwhelming challenge. So, the question becomes how to accomplish punishing the giants and discovering what is influencing them without having to face so many at once. The adventure contains some possible answers.

Keep track of the fate of important giants and their allies or captives. Escaping adversaries will generally flee to the next higher-ranking stronghold (from the steading to the rift and from the rift to Snurre's hall); freed captives may join forces with their rescuers (this is a good way to introduce replacement player characters). This assumes survival of the individuals, of course, as well as opportunity for them to act. Some provision for the movement of surviving giants is given in the latter scenarios, but you will have to modify these according to the outcome of previous adventuring by your group.

> ##### Placing the Adventures
>The preferred habitats of **hill giants**, **frost giants**, and **fire giants** exist in virtually every D&D setting, so it's not too difficult to find locations for the strongholds and the events in *Against the Giants*.
>
>***Dragonlance.*** On Krynn, the alliance of giants could center on the Kharolis Mountains, bringing Abanasinia, Qualinesti, Thorbardin, Kharolis, and Tarsis into the conflict. The ultimate villains in the Dragonlance setting would have to be dark exiles of an even more unexpected sort than those described in this adventure.

>***Eberron.*** The giant conspiracy could have its roots in faraway Xen'drik, with an outpost in Breland serving as the hill giant steading. Or the giants could be from Droaam, perhaps acting against the wishes of the Daughters of Sora Kell due to another sinister influence.

>***Forgotten Realms.*** In Faerûn, the giants could be raiding the Sword Coast after emerging from the Sword Mountains or the Sunset Mountains or the Spine of the World. They might be preparing to move on Damara from out of the Galena Mountains, or to descend upon the Dalelands and Cormyr from the Stormhorns or the Thunder Peaks.

>***Greyhawk.*** The giants might threaten Geoff, Sterich, or other nearby realms from out of the Crystalmists, the Jotens, or even the infamous Barrier Peaks.

## Customizing the Giants
If you want to add some variability to the encounters in these adventures, a good way to do this is by modifying the armor and weapons the giants use. In particular, the servants and the young that are found among the giants might not be outfitted with the gear described in the statistics used for them. Servants could use improvised weapons, such as giant-sized tools and utensils they have available. If you decide to change any giant's melee weapon to some other giant-sized weapon, adjust its damage accordingly: Huge giants deal three times normal weapon damage, and Large giants, such as ogres, deal twice normal weapon damage.

When a giant uses the statistics of an ogre, that creature might use throwing rocks for ranged attacks (assuming any are on hand) rather than the ogre's standard weaponry. If projectiles are available, throwing rocks is always a giant's best (and preferred) ranged attack.

### Giants' Bags
Many opportunities arise throughout these adventures for the characters to search miscellaneous bags and chests that belong to giants. The contents of these containers can be determined randomly by using the following table. Roll 3d4 to determine the number of different items among the contents, then roll d100 for each item and refer to the table to determine its nature. Either apply the result of the roll or use it as inspiration for something along the same lines.

#### Giant's Bag Contents

|:---:|---|
| 01–03 | Old axe blade for use as hand chopper |
| 04–17 | 1d4 small boulders |

| 20–21 | Various and sundry bent brass items |
| 22–23 | 1d6 large iron caltrops |
| 24–25 | Hard cheese, slightly moldy and stinky |
| 26–30 | Shabby wool or hide cloak |

| 99–00 | 1d8 animal teeth or tusks (no ivory value) |

## Running the Adventure
There is considerable information contained herein with respect to what the players see as they explore the steading, and what the inhabitants do if they become aware of the intruders. This does not mean that you, as Dungeon Master, must surrender your creativity and become a mere script reader. You will have to make up certain details for areas and items that characters thoroughly examine and explore. There will inevitably be player actions which the script has not anticipated, and you will have to judge their results. Finally, you can amend and alter monsters and treasures as you see fit, with an eye towards your home campaign and your particular players. If time permits, the giants organize traps, ambushes, and last-ditch defenses against continuing forays into their stronghold.

### Adventure Start
It is assumed that the party has safely arrived at a spot near the giants' stronghold—a small cave, well hidden, where they can hide mounts and equipment. They come to the place of the giants just at dusk. No windows are visible, nor can giants or any other creatures be seen about the place, although occasional bursts of shouting and laughter can be heard faintly from within. The characters have been warned to expect guards at the great doors to the steading, but none are visible. (If the party returns to the stronghold after an initial foray, there will be guards present on the second and subsequent visits.) The time has come to see what is afoot!

If the party decides to retire between forays against the steading, they can retreat to the relative safety of the hidden cave base camp to rest and regain spells—provided they take moderate precautions not to leave a plain trail or be followed to this sanctuary. Failure to take such basic precautions may lead to disaster! The characters are assumed to have brought sufficient supplies for several weeks' stay with them.

## Upper Works: General Features
Map 6.1 shows the layout of the huge timber stronghold of the local clan of hill giants. All outer walls are of logs at least 3 feet in diameter. Inner walls dividing rooms are about 2 feet thick. All inside floors are of stone.

![[002-atg01-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)The steading is in a nasty, damp area, where hard rain is a daily occurrence and wet fog a nightly event. As a result, all wood in the place is very damp and difficult to set aflame.

***Ceilings.*** Ceiling height varies from about 16 feet at the edges to 32 feet at the center, the roof being held up by great, smoke-blackened rafters. The open yard (*area 22*) has no roof.

***Doors.*** Doors are great iron-bound log affairs 1 foot in thickness, each about 7 feet wide and 16 to 18 feet high.

A Medium or smaller creature must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to open any of the doors on the upper level due to their great size and weight. Doors stay open if left that way.

***Illumination.*** Fireplaces are indicated on the map, but the locations of other light sources such as cressets and braziers are not.

***Secret Doors.*** Secret doors in the upper level of the stronghold are relatively easy to find due to the crude construction of the place. It requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door.

### Random Encounters
On the upper level of the stronghold, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, consult the section below that corresponds to the characters' current location.

***Entryway and Long Corridor.*** If the characters are in *area 1* or in the corridor that leads to *area 11*, choose from the following possibilities:

- Two hot-headed **hill giants** heading for the weapons room (*area 13*) from the great hall (*area 11*), intending to fight an impromptu duel
- The **cloud giant** from the great hall (*area 11*) heading for the front gate (*area 1*)
- The **stone giant** from the great hall (*area 11*) heading for the front gate (*area 1*)

***Eastern Section.*** If the characters are in areas 2 through 10, choose from the following possibilities:

- **Grutha**, the chief's wife, coming from the great hall (*area 11*) to get her pet cave bear from her room (see *area 7*)
- A **hill giant** with four **dire wolves** from the open yard (*area 22*) going to the barracks (*area 4*)
- **Chief Nosnra** (see *area 11*) and two **ogres** going to get some trophies from the chief's hall (*area 6*) to show off in the great hall
- 1d4 + 1 young hill giants (use the **orc** statistics) from the dormitory (*area 3*) heading through the open yard (*area 22*) to raid the pantry (*area 18A*)

***Western Section.*** If the characters are in areas 12 through 21, choose from the following possibilities:

- 2d6 orc slaves (**commoners**) rushing to get shields (from area 12 or 13) to use as platters
- Two **hill giants** from the great hall (*area 11*) going to sleep off a drunk (in area 15 or 16)
- Three **ogres** from the great hall (*area 11*) going to get one of the guards from the entryway (*area 1*)
- A **hill giant** from the great hall (*area 11*) taking a stroll to clear his head

***Yard and Barracks Rooms.*** If the characters are in areas 22 through 25, they might encounter a **hill giant** from the great hall (*area 11*) heading for bed.

## Upper Level Locations
The following locations are identified on *map 6.1*.

### 1. Front Gate and Foyer
Most of the floor in the entryway is bare, but various items of giant outerwear (capes, cloaks, and the like) and bags hang from the many pegs along the walls. Use the *Giant's Bag Contents* table to randomly determine what's inside any bag or sack the characters happen to open. Any noise the characters make could awaken the sleeping guards in the area.

***Guards at the Gate.*** Two snoring **hill giants**, supposedly guarding the entrance, lie curled up blissfully asleep just inside the front gate, a nearly empty keg of ale between them. If these guards are attacked and not killed in a single round, they alert the third guard (posted in the watch tower at area 1B).

### 1B. Tower Guard
Steps in the western end of the foyer lead up to the watch tower, where a **hill giant** guard is dozing, an empty flagon smelling of mead still in his hand. An iron hoop and a straight bar hang on ropes from a rafter above; striking them together will alert everyone in the upper level.

***Treasure.*** The guard wears a belt with a gem-set gold buckle (worth 400 gp).

### 2. Subchief's Room
This place contains a scattering of furnishings: hides on the floors, a bear skin on the wall, a chair, a stool, a huge chest, and a vast bed mounted with furs.

Under the furs on the bed is a sleeping **hill giant**. It requires successful DC 8 Dexterity (Stealth) checks for characters to enter this room without waking her, as well as when the characters do anything else that might make enough noise to rouse her. Any loud noise wakes her immediately.

***Treasure.*** On a shelf 9 feet above the floor are a beaten silver comb set with four gems (worth 100 gp), a copper mirror (20 gp), and a large gold hairpin set with a pearl (total value 200 gp). The chest contains 980 cp, 320 sp, and 400 gp.

### 3. Dormitory
Here twelve young hill giants (use the **orc** statistics) are rollicking; beefy smacks, and shouts, laughter can easily be heard through the corridor outside. All these youngsters have weapons and will readily attack any intruders they spot. Noise coming from here, even shrieks and swords clashing, will be regarded by others as the kids simply having fun.

### 4. Barracks
Two soundly sleeping, loudly snoring **hill giants** occupy two of the ten beds in the barracks. Typical giant clothing hangs from the walls, and a couple of torches smolder in wall-mounted cressets. A wooden chest stands near the western wall.

***Treasure.*** A small pouch in the chest contains 40 pp.

### 5. Maids' Chamber
Three hill giant servants (use the **ogre** statistics) are in this room, along with the usual furnishings. Only the nasty old matron, a normal **hill giant**, is inclined to fight, but she dominates the others and orders them to attack if necessary. If the matron is slain, the three others cease hostilities and cooperate with the characters by describing **Chief Nosnra**'s sanctum (*areas 8*, *9*, and *10*) and telling how to get there safely—if they are allowed to have the matron's hoard.

***Treasure.*** The matron's valuables are stashed in a locked iron chest under the matron's bed. The matron carries the key to the chest; it can also be unlocked by a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The chest holds 800 gp, three platinum bracelets (worth 1,000 gp each), and four potions: *healing*, *superior healing*, *poison*, and *mind control* (hill giant) (see *appendix A*). The maids can be persuaded to part with the potions.

### 6. Hall of the Chief
Numerous interesting things fill this place, which is dominated by an enormous fireplace. The mantel of the fireplace holds a few items, including a shiny brass jar and a humanoid skull. The room has two tables, several chairs, and two stools, as well as rugs, hides, and skins on the floors and walls.

The tables have pottery flagons and platters on them; pots and kegs are all about the place. The walls display various trophies: heads of humanoids and other creatures, skulls, skins, and some arms and armor. Directly across from the fireplace, eight shields are mounted on the wall.

***Treasure.*** One of the shields on the wall is a *+1 shield*. The brass jar on the mantel of the fireplace might catch the characters' eye, but it has no value. The skull on the mantel is also valueless, but inside it is a large gem worth 500 gp—one of the kids was playing with this bauble and stuck it inside the skull, where it has lain forgotten ever since.

### 7. Chamber of the Chief's Wife
**Grutha**, the chief's wife, is at feast in the great hall (*area 11*), while her pet cave bear (use the **cave bear** variant with the **polar bear** statistics) stays in her room. The creature acts as a guard and immediately attacks any intruder, for it can smell the person at the door. The bear makes no noise until it attacks.

The room has a bed, a small table, a chair, a stool, two chests, and a coffer, plus rugs, hides, and the like. The chests contain only clothing, since she is wearing her jewelry at the banquet.

***Treasure.*** Hidden in the bed's straw mattress is a leather pouch with twenty-nine gems in it: one worth 1,000 gp, three 500 gp each, four 250 gp each, eight 50 gp each, and thirteen of 10 gp value.

### 8. Chief's Chamber
The room where the chief sleeps is hung with rugs and skins, and there are hides on the floor. It holds a bed, two chairs, a small table with a tun of cheap wine on it, a chest for clothing, and other clothing hanging on pegs. A thick chain (for the chief's cave bear) is set into one wall. An old shield and some of the chief's well-used weapons lie on the floor near one of the corners.

### 9. Arms Room
The chief's best personal armor, shields, and weapons are stored in a chamber that can be accessed only by going through the dining room (area 10). There are also four huge fur capes among the dozen or so items in the place.

***Treasure.*** A *javelin of lightning* is wrapped in an old rag, which is stuffed under a cloak thrown into a far corner and shielded from sight by three *spears* and a *club* leaned against the wall in front of it. One of the capes, made of a giant otter pelt, is worth 400 gp.

### 10. Small Dining Room
The room beyond the double doors is used for meals and also the council meetings of the chief. It contains a long table, a great chair, a lesser chair, and six stools. A rough map of the area drawn on a large animal skin, showing past and planned raids, hangs on the wall opposite the fireplace. Several shelves, a smaller table and chair, and some miscellaneous items (a mug, some paper scraps, an old knife, a rock paperweight) round out the furnishings. There are hides on the walls and the floor.

***Hidden Door.*** Near the southwest corner is a door concealed behind a manticore hide hung on the wall. Someone looking around the room can notice the shape of the door behind the hide with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Someone who handles or looks behind the manticore skin finds the door without needing to make a check.

### 10A. Secret Stairs
Several scroll tubes are concealed in this room under a stack of logs in the alcove to the northwest. Someone who glances at the logs notices the bone tubes with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, and any search of the pile reveals them.

One tube, sealed and marked with a triangle surrounding a Y, holds instructions on the next raid, written in Giant and signed *Eclavdra*. Also inside is a map of the floor plan of this level of the steading. All the other tubes are empty.

The steps lead to the secret area of the steading's dungeon level (*areas 29* through *33*).

### 11. Great Hall
The long corridor that leads north from *area 1* is dim, shadowy, and generally deserted and ignored, for all of the feasting and fun lies beyond, in the great hall itself. A few torches burn smokily high up along either wall.

The vast room at the end of the corridor contains trestle tables, benches, stools, and the like. Here and there stand barrels and kegs of ale, beer, and mead. All of the tables are crowded with various sorts of meat, cheese, bread, and drinking containers. Singing, talking, laughing, shouting, arguing, wrestling, joking, and the like are going on, so the place is a veritable din of noise. To the north of the central firepit (where a whole ox, two sheep, and four pigs roast on huge spits) is a higher table reserved for the chief, his wife, and their guests.

***Creatures.*** The following creatures are in the hall:

- **Chief Nosnra** fights as a **frost giant** with no immunities. He has AC 17 from splint armor. The chief is seated at the head table.
- Nosnra's wife, **Grutha**, is a **hill giant**. She sits beside the chief.
- The chief's cave bear (use the **cave bear** variant with the **polar bear** statistics) is licking up spills under the head table at Nosnra's feet.
- The **subchief**, also seated at the head table, is a hill giant that fights as a **stone giant**, without Stone Camouflage. His AC is from splint armor.
- A **cloud giant** ambassador stands near the firepit.
- A **stone giant** visitor is seated at the head table.
- Seven **hill giants**, including the **sergeant** from *area 25* (who has AC 16 from chain mail and 115 hit points), six hill giant servants (use the **ogre** statistics), and eight **ogres** are scattered around the room.

There are no throwing rocks here, aside from the few that some of the giants, especially the stone giant, might carry. On the wall directly behind the chief is a small ballista, which he uses as a heavy crossbow (2d10 piercing damage). It fires spears instead of bolts, and six of those projectiles are ready to hand.

***Treasure.*** Each giant wears one to four pieces of jewelry worth 250 gp each. Ogres each wear one or two pieces worth 100 gp each. The subchief, decked out for the occasion, has four pieces. Nosnra and **Grutha** also wear four pieces of jewelry each, worth 1,000 gp per item. The bear has a jewel-studded collar with six rubies, worth a total of 250 gp.

The largest ogre has a key to the chest in *area 21*.

![[002-totyp-06-03.webp|right|300]]

### 12. Arsenal Room
Thirty helmets, twenty-six shields, twenty-two spears, nine clubs, and three great axes are stored in the arsenal, scattered around the place. All are giant-sized.

### 13. Weapons Room
Spears, shields, clubs, and axes are abundant here—no fewer than a dozen of each, all sized for giants. There are four great swords (two-handed with respect to human-sized creatures), two huge iron maces (Strength 17 required to lift), and a sheaf of 6-foot-long spears that the giants use for javelins. All the shields are leaning against the walls.

***Treasure.*** Behind the seventh shield that the characters check is a *+1 warhammer*. Another hammer is out of sight in a corner and only seen on close inspection of the room. Under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell, it radiates an aura of illusion magic due to a *magic mouth* spell placed on it. If picked up by a dwarf it barks out, "Here's a kiss for you, runt!"

### 14. Main Guest Chamber
The cloud giant ambassador and the stone giant visitor (currently in the great hall, *area 11*) are lodged here. In all, the room holds seven beds and various small furnishings including chairs, nightstands, and chests. One torch burns at the west end of the room in a sconce; on the opposite wall is a sconce holding a large, unlit torch. Various skins and hides cover the floors. Several others hang on the walls alongside giant garments on pegs. All are worthless, as are the contents of all the chests and the bags tucked under four of the beds. Still, a valuable reward waits for those who can find it.

***Treasure.*** The unlit torch is an illusion, and making physical contact with it reveals it as such. Someone who examines the image without touching it can determine that it is an illusion by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The sconce is actually the sheath for a weapon that belongs to the cloud giant: a sentient greatsword named *Waythe* (see *appendix A*).

### 15. Common Room
The place contains several cots, boxes, and stools, a table, two benches, and various odds and ends.

### 16. Common Room
This place is almost identical to the matching room across the hall (area 15), with the addition of a few cloaks plus some hides on the floors and walls.

***Treasure.*** A small chest on a stool in the northeast corner contains some dwarf and elf ears, and one of them has an earring still attached with a gem in it (worth 50 gp).

### 17. Kitchen
This is a typical giant kitchen with counters along the walls, several tables, benches, a stool or two, and various items for cooking and baking (pots, kettles, bowls, knives, forks, spoons, ladles, spits, and so forth).

Twenty-nine orc slaves (**commoners**) work about the place, but they run away from conflict. Five hill giant servants (use the **ogre** statistics) and six young ogre servants (use the **orc** statistics) also run, but they call loudly for help as they flee.

### 18. Kitchen Workroom
The storage area north of the kitchen doubles as an eating place for servants. It includes three tables, a long counter, stools, benches, and an assortment of kitchen gear. Numerous sacks, boxes, and barrels contain flour, dried meat, dried fruit, honey, and other foodstuffs. Various cheeses, smoked meats, and sausages hang from the rafters. Several casks and tuns hold a wide variety of potables—ale, beer, mead, and wine—all of giant strength. Loaves of bread, still warm from the ovens, are stacked on one table.

### 18A. Pantry
The room to the south contains more provisions of the same types found in the kitchen workroom (area 18), as well as stairs that lead to the dungeon level.

### 19. Servants' Quarters
A large common room in the extreme north end of the stronghold has various cots, tables, chairs, stools, and the like. It is cluttered with old clothing and junk. Six hill giant servants (use the **ogre** statistics) are here, and a few are flirting with a handsome male **hill giant**. The giant enters combat to show off for his admirers. He will not call for help unless his current hit points drop to less than half of his hit point maximum. On the round when this happens, he begins to shout. Some of the servants aid him if he starts to cry out, but others prefer to avoid direct conflict, perhaps taking the opportunity to hurt or disadvantage a character from the blind side.

The giant warrior is **the keeper** of the wolves in *area 22*. His whip is hanging beside the door in the southeast corner of this room; this whip need only be shown to the wolves to make them whimper, cower, and fall back.

### 20. Orc Slave Quarters
This hall is a messy and smelly place filled with pallets and junk. The two orc slaves (**commoners**) currently in this place are too injured to work (since giants' kicks break bones). All the other slaves are elsewhere, helping with the feast.

The two slaves will happily aid the characters if allowed to do so. These orcs know about the rebellion in the dungeons, and they tell the party that any orcs they see down there should be hailed as friends. Aside from that, they are familiar with only the servants' quarters (*area 19*), the kitchen (*area 17*), and the great hall (*area 11*).

### 21. Ogre Quarters
The hill giants employ ogres as scouts, messengers, servants, and the like, for the ogres are trusty flunkies as well as hard workers and fighters. In addition to those in the great hall (*area 11*) and the youngsters at work in the kitchen (*area 17*), five more **ogres** are in their quarters playing at knucklebones and drinking beer. Ogres are a rowdy lot; hence, noise from this place attracts no attention. Scattered on the floor of the room are nearly a dozen heaps of skins on which the ogres sleep, and a locked iron chest is tucked into one corner.

***Treasure.*** Hidden inside one of the heaps of skins is a leather sack containing a *potion of storm giant strength* and a *potion of invisibility*. There are ten such heaps, and the sack is hidden in the seventh one that the characters search.

One ogre wears a gem (worth 250 gp) on a thong around his neck. The creatures have 381 cp between them as the stakes for their game.

The lock on the chest can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or by someone who uses the key that is carried by one of the ogres in the great hall (*area 11*). The chest holds 955 sp, 202 gp, and 19 pp.

### 22. Open Yard
Fourteen **dire wolves** run free here, and they immediately attack any humanoid that enters their area. If they see the whip from *area 19*, however, they cower and whimper, allowing the intruders to pass unchallenged.

### 23. Guard Room
A huge horn rests upon the small table in the center of the room; blowing it calls the dire wolves. Eight stools and two benches line the walls, and a sheaf of eighteen *spears* is leaning against the wall by the door. A line of seven giant-sized shields and four clubs stands along the south wall. The guards that would normally be stationed here have gone to the celebration in the great hall.

### 24. Barracks Room
No one currently occupies the hill giants' barracks room. The place contains ten beds, equal numbers of chests and stools, two tables, a bench, and miscellaneous junk. A few hides decorate the floors and walls, and several broken weapons and dented helmets are strewn about.

### 25. Barracks Room
This room's contents are similar to those in area 24 (see above), except for the partially enclosed area to the northwest. This alcove belongs to the **sergeant** of the guards, who is now away feasting. There are three chests in the space, all filled with clothing and equipment for the troops and herself. Giant-sized boots are gathered in a sack that hangs from the wall.

***Treasure.*** One of the boots near the bottom of the sack has 300 gp and two gems (worth 100 gp each) stuffed inside it. Another sack under the sergeant's cot has nothing but old (human-sized) helmets in it, mementos from foes she has slain.

## Dungeon Level: General Features
Map 6.2 shows the layout of the steading's lower level. The stonework is ancient but holding up well, patched in places with new mortar or shored up with newly hewn stone. All natural cave areas have stalagmites, but for ease of passage the giants have removed stalactites from the central caverns (*areas 19*–*21*).

![[005-atg02-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)***Ceilings.*** Passageways have ceilings that are arched, and buttressed every 10 feet, with the peak of the arch about 18 feet overhead. The ceiling height in most smallish rooms in the dungeon is 20 feet or so, again arched and buttressed. In the large rooms and chambers, the ceilings are 30 feet high. The roof in the natural caverns to the southeast (areas 19–21) is of varying height, the passages about 15 feet high and the large areas some 20 feet or more. The roof of the carrion crawlers' lair (*area 23*) is about 40 feet high.

***Doors.*** Unless otherwise noted, doors on the dungeon level are the same as those on the upper level, made of iron-bound logs and each about 7 feet wide and 16 to 18 feet high.

***Illumination.*** Torches and braziers provide light in several locations, and a few areas are illuminated by other means, as indicated in the area descriptions. The caverns of unworked stone (areas 19, 20, 21, and 23) are unlit.

***Secret Doors.*** Secret doors on the dungeon level are hidden well. It requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door.

### Random Encounters
On the dungeon level, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, consult the section below that corresponds to the characters' current location.

***Excavated Rooms and Passages.*** If the characters are in *areas 1* through *18*, *area 22*, or *areas 24* through *33*, roll a d12. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- Four **ogres** seeking some orcs
- **The Keeper** (see *area 2*), out inspecting, accompanied by an **ape** (one of his pets)
- Twelve rebel **orcs** out raiding for food, two armed with heavy crossbows and poisoned bolts

***Caverns.*** If the characters are in areas 19 through 21 or area 23, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- 1d4 young **giant lizards** from *area 21*
- 1d3 **carrion crawlers** coming from *area 22* by way of the sinkholes

## Dungeon Level Locations
The following locations are identified on map 6.2.

### 1. Marshaling Area
At the bottom of the stairs that lead from *area 18A* on the upper level is a room where slaves are rounded up and sent about their tasks under guard. It is also used for the revels of the off-duty dungeon crew. A few smoky torches burn along the walls. Several benches and tables are pushed out of the way against the walls, revealing a floor of black stone, much worn by the tread of countless feet.

### 2. Chamber of the Keeper
![[004-totyp-06-04.webp|right|300]]

A cluttered room near the marshaling area has skins on the floor, a bed, a table and chair, two wooden boxes, several crates and barrels, a chest, and odds and ends of armor, weapons, furniture, tableware, and so forth.

Residing here is **the Keeper**, a ghastly hill giant (use the **stone giant** statistics, without Stone Camouflage) that is hunchbacked and twisted, and has only one good eye. He is thoroughly wicked, strong, and remorseless. In his lair, he is never without his two pet **apes** (which have 30 hit points each). One is on guard to the north of the door, the other resting on a platform built above the door.

**The Keeper** wears a thick chain mail shirt (accounting for his AC), and he fights with a giant-sized *+1 battleaxe* that gives him a +10 bonus to hit. He has a reach of 15 feet with the weapon, which deals 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage on a hit.

***Treasure.*** Beneath a loose stone in the floor is a hole that contains 1,250 gp, three 250 gp gems, two 100 gp gems, and a large earthenware jug that holds four *potions of water breathing*.

### 3. Cell Block
In the outer guard room are two **bugbears**, initially located in the eastern end of the area. If not engaged immediately, they will raise an alarm by striking a large brass gong that hangs near the door. If they are prevented from doing so and are faced by an obviously superior enemy, the bugbears feign surrender and direct the characters' attention to the fourth cell (see below), where—so they say—treasure is to be had. Then, when the characters are occupied fighting the monsters that await within that cell, the bugbears will strike the alarm and flee. In addition to the alarm gong, the guard room contains a table, two stools, torches, and a ring of keys that open four of the five cell doors.

The cells, from left to right, have the following occupants:

***First Cell.*** A human merchant (**noble**), taken prisoner some time ago and now quite insane from mistreatment, is in the cell nearest the door.

***Second Cell.*** A second human prisoner, an engineer (**commoner**), is kept alive to help with the excavation of new areas of the dungeon. He cannot aid his rescuers, but he will repay them with service.

***Third Cell.*** An elf **knight** is chained to the wall. He is wounded from torture (currently down to 14 hit points). He gladly takes up arms to aid his rescuers and is willing to serve his rescuers for one year without pay in gratitude for his freedom.

***Fourth Cell.*** The bugbear guards will say that they have been instructed to keep three "magical skeletons" in one of the cells safe from would-be thieves. To back up their tale, they point out—quite truthfully—that they have no key to this cell. Indeed, there are three skeletal creatures lying on the floor, each one wearing a shiny ring set with a large gemstone.

The lock on the door can be opened by a character who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check while using thieves' tools, or the door can be forced by someone who makes a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

The three creatures are **wights** that spring to attack anyone who enters the cell. The rings they wear are nothing but brass, and the gems gemstone (glass).

***Fifth Cell.*** Five captured **orcs** rebels are crammed into the easternmost cell. Three others of their number have already been tortured to death and eaten, so they will be very willing to help any creature promising them escape from the toils of the giants. These orcs can lead the characters south and east to the rebels' hideout (*area 19*) and will see them safely past the guards behind the barricade to the south (at the location marked B) if the characters can handle the bugbear at the watch post (W) to the west of that place.

### Bugbear Complex (4-8)
Each of the five areas of the bugbear community has a few torches and braziers burning. Hides and skins decorate walls and floors, while mounds of straw and similar litter serve for bedding. Rounding out the furnishings are a few stools and small crates, boxes, and the like, a scattering of (worthless) personal belongings, and tables with scraps of food and odds and ends of eating utensils upon them.

#### 4. Outpost
This room holds eight **bugbears**, alert and ready for trouble. They carry 2d4 gp each.

#### 5. Barracks
This small barracks holds nine sleeping bugbears.

#### 6. Barracks
This small barracks is similar to area 5, with eight sleeping bugbears.

#### 7. Chamber of the Bugbear Captain
Currently, five bugbears—the captain (a **bugbear chief**) and four lieutenants (**bugbears**)—are sitting around a crude table drinking ale and discussing a plan to wipe out the rebel orcs in *area 19*. All these bugbears have longswords that deal 11 (2d8 + 2) slashing damage on a hit. All five are carrying 50 gp each. The captain also has thirty-one 10 gp gems hidden in a pouch under his armor.

#### 8. Outpost
Six **bugbears** watch this point. These alert fellows are readying for an attack on the rebel orcs. One of them is always stationed in the corridor outside the south exit (at the place marked W on the map), watching the barricade (B) to the east for any signs of activity.

### Obedient Slave Quarters (9-11)
The three chambers south of the bugbear complex are occupied by orc slaves that are considered docile by their captors. As such, these rooms are not heavily guarded. Each door is barred on the outside with a heavy iron rod.

Each room has a few smoky torches on the walls and moldy straw strewn on the floor. Some crude benches are built into the walls.

The occupants of these rooms are subdued to the point of being nearly helpless. They will defend themselves if harmed, but they offer no resistance otherwise.

#### 9. Barracks
This room holds twenty-four unarmed orc slaves (six **orcs**, eighteen orc **commoners**).

#### 10. Barracks
This room holds thirty unarmed orc slaves (seven **orcs**, twenty-three orc **commoners**).

#### 11. Barracks
This room holds twenty-five unarmed orc slaves (five **orcs**, twenty orc **commoners**).

***Barricade.*** East of these three rooms (near the place marked B on the map), the corridor is blocked by an accumulation of boulders and debris.

### Unruly Slave Quarters (Areas 12–14)
Three enclosures to the west of the bugbear complex are used to house orc slaves that have proved themselves to be troublesome; as such, this area is under heavy scrutiny. A **bugbear** guard, watching for trouble, is stationed at each position marked W on the map.

Each of the barracks is secured by a barred gate through which the bugbears can keep an eye on the slaves. Each set of bars is secured by a lock and a bolt. The lock can be opened by a character who uses thieves' tools and succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check, or the gate can be forced open by someone who makes a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.

The rooms are unlit, have only scanty straw, and are quite noisome with the scent of unwashed orc.

The slaves housed in these rooms are not as meek as those in the chambers to the south. If their guards are dispatched and they are freed, some of them might be willing to take up arms against the giants.

#### 12. Barracks
This chamber holds forty-eight unarmed orc slaves (thirteen **orcs**, thirty-five orc **commoners**).

#### 13. Barracks
This chamber holds twenty-four unarmed orc slaves (five **orcs**, nineteen orc **commoners**).

#### 14. Barracks
This chamber holds sixteen unarmed orc slaves (ten **orcs**, six orc **commoners**). If released, they are particularly eager to attack their captors. They know of a haven for orc refugees somewhere to the south but not the exact location of the rebel headquarters.

### 15. Torture Chamber
This large area contains various implements for torturing prisoners large and small—an iron maiden, two racks, thumbscrews, iron boots, chains, whips, branding irons, strappados, and so forth. A firepit in the center of the room lends it all a hellish light.

Huddled next to the northwest and southwest walls, two **hill giants** are dozing.

***Treasure.*** One giant wears a gold chain set with a fire opal in the manner of a watch fob (worth 500 gp).

### 16. Armory and Smithy
Stacks of giant arms and armor, either newly made or in need of repair, clutter this place. The alcove north of the entrance holds several pike-sized spears, battleaxes, two-handed swords, and other weapons and armor usable only by giants. Some helmets are balanced on shields, each propped up by a warhammer or a mace.

The armorer and the smith, two **fire giants**, are occupied in the eastern section of the room when the characters enter. If any of the armor and weapons in the northern section are touched, they collapse with a clatter that warns the armorer and the smith of trouble. The giants immediately shout and come out fighting.

Also in the room, near the forge and bellows in the southwest corner, are five dwarves chained to the floor and forced to labor making weapons. Four of them are dwarf **commoners** intent only on escaping if they are released, but the fifth is a **veteran** who volunteers to stay with the characters as long as he receives a share of treasure equal to that of a character and a chance to fight giants.

***Treasure.*** The armorer and the smith each have a sack filled with 1,000 gp.

### 17. Blocked Passage
The rebel orcs have piled finished and rough stones against the north side of this door to keep it closed. The wooden door is bound with moldering bands of bronze, and a heavy bronze bolt secures it. Beyond the door, the corridor that leads to the southwest is disused, dusty, and reeks disgustingly.

### 17A. Weird Abandoned Temple
This room is lined with faintly glowing purplish-green stone, engraved with disturbing shapes and signs that seem to stare out from the walls and columns and to shift positions when the viewer's back is turned. Touching the walls sends a chill up a character's spine, and touching a pillar brings on nausea—a creature that does so must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned for 1 hour.

At the far west end of the temple is an altar of pale, yellow-gray translucent stone. It feels greasy to the touch but has no obvious effect upon those who touch it. Behind this altar is a flight of low, uneven stairs that lead to a semicircular alcove with a back wall made of a purplish-black, glassy-appearing substance. Anyone who stands before this wall and gazes upon it for 1 round sees a writhing, amorphous form of sickly mauve and violet stretching its formless members to embrace the viewer. This sight forces a character to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be cursed with insanity (as the *symbol* spell's insanity effect, but permanent until ended with *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, *heal*, or similar magic).

***Treasure.*** The first character who views the wall and does not go mad discovers that a *ring of mind shielding* has appeared on the altar. Any other character who undergoes the ordeal and succeeds on the saving throw is rewarded with a 1,000 gp gem that appears on the altar.

### 18. Buried Vestry
The visible walls of the corridor leading south bear faint traces of disgusting murals and bas-relief depictions of nasty things. After about 40 feet, the way is completely blocked by tons of stone blocks and rubble.

### 19. Natural Cavern
In their excavations, the ancient builders of the stronghold stumbled upon an enormous expanse of natural caves and caverns. The southern part of this network is now inhabited by seventy-eight escaped orc slaves, including two **orogs**, twenty-six **orcs**, and fifty orc **commoners**, for whom the place is a sanctuary.

The orcs, making ready for a rebellion against the giants, are armed with clubs, axes, daggers, and various cast-off weapons, as well as seven highly prized crossbows. They obtain food from raids, supplemented by fungus they find in a subterranean cave accessed through the sinkhole along the southwest edge of the cavern.

The rebel orcs have an uneasy truce with the nearby troglodytes (see *area 20*) and trade food to these creatures in exchange for water. If the orcs are approached in a non-hostile manner, they become agreeable immediately if the characters mention the possibility of fighting against bugbears or giants.

***Guard Posts.*** The orcs have guards at several locations (marked G on the map) whose main function is to act as lookouts in case of incursion from any of the adjoining areas. These orcs will flee into *area 19* to warn the others if they spot trouble.

***Treasure.*** The orcs' scavenged loot amounts to 119 cp, 23 sp, and 45 gp.

### 20. Troglodyte Cavern
A tribe of troglodytes dwells in the central portion of the cavern complex. The group includes twenty-three adult **troglodytes** and fourteen young (use the **kobold** statistics). Trapped as they are between the orcs in *area 19* and the lizards at *area 21*, they are trying to make do until they can escape.

***Treasure.*** The tribe's leader has four gems worth 100 gp each. Nine of the other troglodytes have single gems, seven worth 50 gp each and two 10 gp ones. These gems are regarded as holy things by the troglodytes, and any other creature that touches one of them will be savagely attacked.

### 21. Lizards' Lair
A mated pair of exceptionally old and large subterranean lizards have chosen this spot to raise their young. The adults use the statistics for **giant crocodiles**, except that they have a climbing speed of 30 feet, no swimming speed, and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Their four young use the statistics for **giant lizards**.

These reptiles occasionally dart forth on forays to hunt and devour troglodytes or orcs, but their main hunting ground is the series of caves beneath their own, the entrance to which is through the sinkhole on the eastern edge of their lair. Those unmapped lower caverns wander off into the darkness, and are barren of treasure or anything of interest aside from many different types of fungus. The lizards feed on the fungus when more substantial fare is unavailable.

### 22. Partially Cleared Passage to Cistern
The well-like chamber at the end of the broad corridor is filled with a deep pool of water. This dark liquid is cool and wholesome to drink, and only a few albino tadpoles dwell in it. It is an emergency water supply fed from several spouting springs that come through holes in the wall to the west.

The pool is 14 feet deep, and at the bottom is an outlet large enough for a Medium humanoid to pass through, The opening is finished stone, obviously constructed. This outlet slants upward, providing access to the stream that flows through *area 23*. Anyone who travels downstream, along a route that is underwater the whole time, comes out about three miles below the stronghold in a small pond.

### 23. Cavern of the Carrion Crawlers
![[005-totyp-06-06.webp|right|300]]

In the northern end of the cavern complex, two sinkholes lead down to an even larger area where a number of carrion crawlers lurk. They come up to this area from time to time to breed or to devour prey that the creatures have dragged here to consume at leisure. All sorts of bones, human and otherwise, are heaped and piled here and there. Seldom does any other sort of creature venture into the place, for any that do usually end up by adding their bones to the litter.

Two **carrion crawlers** are in the northeast finger of the cavern when the characters first enter. Every 10 minutes, there is a 30 percent chance that 1d3 more of these monsters appear from either the northern or southern sinkhole.

***Treasure.*** Significant treasure has accumulated in the creatures' lair over the centuries, but it can be hard to find among all the bones and other debris. It takes three persons 30 minutes to thoroughly search the entire area. If such a search is conducted, refer to the *Treasure Hoard: Challenge 5–10 table* in Chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Roll once for each type of coin, then roll d100 to determine whether any gems, art objects, or magic items are also found.

### 24. Storage Room
The chamber at the end of the corridor leading northwest contains various tools for digging and stone masonry—shovels, pickaxes, hammers, drills, chisels, baskets, and so forth, many sized for giants but some for smaller creatures.

The door to the north is locked with a huge padlock. Unlocking it requires thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The door can be forced open by someone who succeeds on a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.

### 25. Wine Cellar
A padlocked door identical to the one at area 24 blocks entry to the wine cellar. Inside, in addition to several large barrels, and various kegs, thirteen casks of exceptional wine, holding 5 gallons each, are stored here. Each of the casks has a bung seal with a blob of black wax impressed with a death's head.

The wine is black, has a slightly earthy smell, tastes like no other drink, and is of such excellence that it is difficult to stop drinking it. A character who tastes the wine must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (drinker's choice) to keep from becoming intoxicated. (One quart is enough to make a giant reel, while a pint will make a human drunk.) On a failed save, the drinker becomes drunk (poisoned) for 1 hour, and must then repeat the saving throw.

On a successful save after 1 hour, a character stops drinking and is no longer drunk. On a failed save after 1 hour, the character continues to drink until falling unconscious for several hours, then awakens and remains drunk for 1 hour thereafter.

Once a character's drunken state ends, whether after 1 hour or several hours, the drinker suffers one level of exhaustion.

***Treasure.*** This wine is a gift to **Chief Nosnra**, in return for his good services, from the creatures that are masterminding the attacks by the giants, although at best the characters can only guess at this fact. Due to its potency and quality, it has a market value of 500 gp per cask if characters can transport it safely out of the dungeon and back to civilization.

### 26. Gallery Under Clearance
The north face of this area is being cleared, and a few tools are scattered about. The place is otherwise unremarkable and empty.

### 27. Chamber Under Clearance
Another unlit and unremarkable place with a few tools left lying around.

### 28. Quarters for Stone Giant Miners
The chamber at the end of the corridor holds piles of skins, five cots, several stools, two tables, and several chests and sacks containing personal gear (including several huge, thin books on mining techniques written in Giant, with many illustrations).

Two **stone giants**, subordinates of the one currently in the great hall, make this room their abode. These giants are the master miners and engineers for all work in the dungeon. They are not interested in fighting for the hill giants and politely decline combat with intruders unless they are attacked or extorted.

***Treasure.*** If characters search through the personal gear, the third chest opened contains the giants' accumulated pay, amounting to 4,800 gp.

### 29. False Treasure
If the characters descend the stairs in *area 10A* and follow the obvious route, they come to a large chamber in which a faint glint of light shines from the far western wall. A collection of coffers can be found in that area, one tipped so that some of the gems it held are strewn before it. (The gems are worthless rocks, and the unopened coffers hold more of the same.)

To the south, thick iron bars separate this room from another chamber that is shrouded in darkness.

If a character touches one of the coffers or the spilled contents, thick iron bars drop from above the entrance. This portcullis can be lifted by someone who makes a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. At the same time, the bars that block entry into the adjacent room (area 30) lift into the ceiling, allowing the creatures therein to emerge and attack.

### 30. Imprisoned Guards
Four **manticores** are confined here by Nosnra to serve as guards for his treasure. Fed kitchen garbage dumped down a chute from above, these monsters are wild with rage at their captivity and attack any creature if the opportunity presents itself. The manticores can fire their tail spikes through the gaps in the bars but cannot attack through the bars with bites or claws.

If the bars across the entrance are down, they can be lifted by someone who makes a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. A separate check is required for each 10-foot section.

### 31. Minor Treasure Room
The place that the manticores are supposed to guard is the storage area for the chief's excess coinage.

***Treasure.*** The room contains seven chests and some empty boxes. The chests have the following contents:

- The first chest holds bags of coins (amounting to a total of 13,000 cp).
- Opening the second chest triggers a scything blade trap that targets the opener (+7 to hit), dealing 10 (3d6) slashing damage on a hit. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character spots alterations to the hinges that are part of the trap mechanism. Thieves' tools can be used to disable the trap, along with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The chest holds bags of coins (totaling 9,100 sp).
- The third chest holds loose coins (a total of 2,400 ep) and an unlabeled potion (actually a *potion of poison*).
- Inside the fourth chest are twenty-seven copper ingots worth 400 cp each.
- The fifth chest is empty.
- The sixth chest holds eleven ivory tusks worth 250 gp each.
- The seventh chest is locked, and the lock is trapped with a poison needle (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). The needle deals 1 piercing damage and delivers a dose of drow poison (see "*Sample Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). Inside the chest are loose gems, three hundred twenty-five in all, worth 1 gp each.

### 32. Secret Room
This hideaway is equipped with spy-holes for the chief so he can look out upon *areas 1* or 29. (There are also smaller spy-holes at about 5 feet off the ground that the hill giant has never noticed.)

Two levers are set in the west wall. These control the thick portcullises that can block off entry to *area 29* or release the manticores in *area 30*.

### 33. Chief's Secret Treasure Room
![[006-totyp-06-07.webp|right|300]]

Beyond the secret door to this room waits a hidden pit, 30 feet deep, with a trapdoor cover that snaps shut once someone has fallen through it. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can discern the edge of the trapdoor. In addition, someone who prods a pit lid forces the pit open with a successful DC 10 Strength check. The lid can be wedged shut with a piton or similar shim. A character doing so must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check to place the shim, or else the shim fails if someone treads on the pit. A creature that falls in takes falling damage plus 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes. The spikes are also poisoned, so someone injured by them must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Treasure.*** The room holds a number of valuable items, including:

- 8,000 gp in loose coins inside a large chest
- 1,000 pp in a locked iron box (requiring thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open)
- Eleven 100 gp gems, four 500 gp gems, and two 1,000 gp gems in a small coffer
- Seven pieces of jewelry (worth 500 gp each) in another small coffer

In addition, a large growth of yellow mold seems to cover the southwest corner of the room. Making physical contact with this image reveals its illusory nature. Someone who examines the image without touching it can determine that it is an illusion by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a successful check, the illusion fades for that character, becoming transparent enough to see through.

The illusion conceals the following items, which are hung upon the wall: a quiver of eleven *+1 arrows*, a *+2 spear*, and a *flame tongue shortsword*. A character attuned to this sword can use an action to mentally command it to detect gems and jewels. Someone who does so learns the kind and number of such objects within 60 feet of the sword.

Finally, what appears to be a broken barrel rests in the southeast corner. This is another illusion, concealing a well-made, watertight cask that holds a map showing the location of the frost giants' glacial rift and an obsidian box.

Inside this latter container is a long, thin chain made of weird black metal and instructions written in Giant (using Dwarvish script) on a sheet of human skin. The instructions indicate that the chain is a magical device meant to be placed on a flat surface and looped into a figure-8 shape. (It radiates an aura of conjuration to the use of *detect magic*.) Thus configured, it can transport up to one giant or six human-sized persons standing in each loop of the figure-8 to the glacial rift, if one of their number is holding the map. (Nosnra uses this method of escaping if he finds himself in desperate straits.)

## Running the Adventure
As with the first part of the adventure, you should feel free to make substitutions as you see fit. Note that if the giants here have learned of the fate that befell the hill giants, or if survivors from the steading reached them, they will be on the alert. Furthermore, the **frost giants** will organize traps, ambushes, and last-ditch defenses against continuing forays into their stronghold, taking full advantage of the treacherous terrain (ice slides, rigging tunnels to collapse on the party, and so forth). They will also make active efforts to locate the characters' base of operations (**winter wolves** make good trackers) and, if successful, attack it at the most inopportune time. Finally, make sure to keep track of the fate of important giants and their allies or captives; those who survive might play roles later in the adventure.

### Start
It is assumed that the party has either followed the map obtained at the steading or used the magical chain found there to arrive in the neighborhood of the glacial rift. If they spend a few hours searching the area, they discover a hidden cave in which they can safely hide themselves, their mounts, equipment, and even treasure if they take minimum precautions with respect to keeping their hiding place secret (do not lead pursuers to the spot, allow a light to show, make undue noise there, etc.). In any event, the same search will also reveal the rift.

The party can travel on the surface of the glacier-mountain (over the caves shown) to circumvent the whole rift if they so desire. Ropes can be lowered to gain the ledges below—a distance of some 50 to 150 feet depending on position. Every hour the party moves along the icy terrain, randomly choose one character to make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the check fails, the character slips and falls. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character goes over the edge of the rift.

The whole place is windy and very cold. Visibility atop the rift is about 150 feet. The wind at the bottom of the rift is worse still, and visibility there is only 30 feet. The floor of the rift is a maze of snow and ice hillocks and mounds, with peaks of ice and rock thrusting up here and there like fangs. All movement in the rift is hampered by this difficult terrain. Due to wind force and eddying currents, attempts at levitation or flying cause movement in a random direction equal to half the distance traveled (use a d8 to determine direction: 1 north, 2 northeast, 3 east, and so on).

If the party is on the floor of the rift and fleeing from pursuing monsters, the blizzard-like conditions in this area makes the characters hard to catch. The characters have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to evade pursuit. At the same time, winter wolves are considered to have passive Perception scores 4 higher than normal when they are pursuing the characters.

The map the characters have shows only the location of the rift and the entrance to the place, and they have no other idea as to which path they should follow. Other than a few traces of giant footprints, the ice and wind-driven snow hide all traces of who or what uses the ledges to gain access to the caves. The characters must learn for themselves what lies in store.

If the adventurers decide to fall back between forays into the rift, they can use their hidden cave as a base if they have seen to its provisioning.

## Upper Level: General Features
Map 6.3 shows the layout of the upper level of the glacial rift. The passage from the northeast at the top of the map indicates the beaten path that the giants follow to enter the glacial rift. The path forks inside the entrance, each side leading to one of the icy ledges along either face of the rift. The caves and caverns herein are basically formed from ice, with a few areas of rock outcropping here and there.

![[010-atg03-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)Both ledges slope gradually downward, as indicated by the elevation markers on the map, from a height of 250 feet above the bottom of the rift at their northern beginnings to about 150 feet above the rift at the ledges' far ends to the south. The central area is the rift itself, and the openings along it are the entrances to the caves and tunnels in its face.

***Boulders.*** Several cave mouths on this level are blocked by huge boulders (at the places marked B on the map). For Medium or smaller creatures, moving these obstructions out of the way requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

***Ceilings.*** Caves and caverns have ceilings from 30 to 45 feet high, while tunnels and passages are from 25 to 30 feet high.

***Illumination.*** Throughout this level a faint greenish light penetrates from above, making torches or similar lights unnecessary.

***Secret Doors.*** Secret doors in the rift are coated in ice and snow, and thus difficult to find. It requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door.

***Slippery Ice.*** *Fireball* spells or other fire effects used in these icy areas will make the footing within the area of effect very slippery. A creature hit by an attack or that moves more than half its speed over slippery ice must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. For 5 minutes after such magical fire is used, the area will also be filled with fog that renders the area heavily obscured.

### Tokens of Free Passage
In a few locations within the rift, the characters can find and obtain special items that enable them to move through the stronghold without raising an alarm. If one member of a group displays a token of free passage, its privilege extends to the entire group. Those individuals are safe from attacks by the giants or the giants' allies as long as they take no aggressive action.

### Random Encounters
On the upper level of the frost giant stronghold, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, roll a d12. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- 1d4 + 1 **yetis**
- One **frost giant**
- 1d4 + 1 **ogres**
- 1d6 + 1 **winter wolves**

## Upper Level Locations 
The following locations are identified on *map 6.3*.

### 1. Guardroom Ice Cavern
One **frost giant** keeps watch here at all times to prevent any unauthorized use of the long passage that leads south. If combat goes against the giant, he flees through this passage to give a warning of intruders to the guards at *areas 9 and 10*.

The room contains piles of hides, a giant sack, and a pile of rocks and ice chunks for hurling. The guard certainly hurls missiles if not immediately forced into melee. His treasure is at *area 6*. Note that the giant in area 2 will hear sounds of combat here and rush to aid his comrade (and vice versa).

### 2. Guardroom Ice Cave
One **frost giant** waits here on standby guard. On the floor of the cave are a pile of sleeping skins and two bags. The guard has an ample supply of rocks and ice blocks at hand for hurling at opponents.

If the giant hears noise from area 1, he rushes there to help; conversely, if attacked, he will raise a cry to bring the guard from area 1 to aid him.

***Treasure.*** Under the pile of skins is a silver belt worth 250 gp. The giant wears a jeweled chain on his wrist (a 500 gp necklace), and one of the sacks holds 950 gp.

### 3. Empty Ice Cave
If loud noise is made in the unoccupied chamber south of the guardroom, the ceiling of ice and icicles in this area partially collapses. A creature beneath the ceiling must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Softer noises or visual clues could give warning of the unstable ice.

### 4. Small Ice Cave
This bone-strewn cave is the den of two adult **winter wolves** and their three half-grown pups (use the **dire wolf** statistics). If the young are harmed, the parents fight recklessly, risking opportunity attacks and ganging up to kill quickly.

### 5. Ice Caverns
![[008-totyp-06-09.webp|right|300]]

In a chamber southeast of the wolves' lair, the giants have preserved eight corpses of mutilated victims, standing them upright and enclosing them in blocks of transparent ice. These exhibits are meant to frighten off any trespassers. The bodies are obviously hacked and very dead, not merely frozen whole.

***Treasure.*** Each of these corpses has some valuable item with it in the ice. Beginning with the northernmost one and proceeding clockwise, the ice blocks contain:

- A dwarf and a *+1 battleaxe*
- An elf with a long case at its feet (containing a *staff of frost*)
- A human wearing a jeweled belt (worth 1,000 gp)
- A human with a tube in its hand that contains a *scroll of protection* (elementals)
- A dwarf that has a spilled pouch of gems at its feet (thirty-seven in all, worth 10 gp each)
- A human wearing a *ring of resistance (fire)*
- A half-elf grasping a sack with a burst seam showing silvery coins (471 sp)
- A human wearing gleaming armor that is actually *armor of vulnerability* (DM's choice)

Strong vibrations here, such as from loud noise, can cause a cave-in like that described in *area 3*.

### 6. Provisions
Various pieces of frozen meat, some bales of cloth, piles of hides, and a few odd boxes and barrels of foodstuffs are stashed in an out-of-the-way cave.

***Treasure.*** If the characters move any of the boxes and barrels around, the third container moved will reveal a hole filled with 600 gp, four 250 gp gems, and a silver tube (worth 50 gp) that holds a *spell scroll* bearing a 3rd-level *cure wounds* spell.

### 7. Cavern
This natural rock cavern is covered with ice formations, so unless the characters pay particular attention, only the lack of light will tip them off that they are no longer surrounded by solid ice. On the floor near the southeastern end of the place are four big heaps of furry hides (or more, if ogres from the steading survived and relocated here).

The hides cover four sleeping **ogres**, who are awaiting an audience with the jarl. Any noise will awaken them, and they will give the alarm to their fellows in area 8 as well as attempting to give the party the slip and warn the giants too.

***Treasure.*** Each ogre has 200 gp and a gem worth 100 gp.

### 8. South Cavern
Ogre mercenaries that serve **Jarl Grugnur** dwell here. There are currently six **ogres** here. All fight fiercely when ordered to do so, or when they come upon intruders. Also in the place are five chests, twelve sacks, and three barrels, as well as many piles of the usual skins and hides used for beds.

***Treasure.*** Some of the containers in this cavern have items of value or possible interest.

The second chest opened contains an ear collection, and the fourth holds 1,300 cp, 1,000 sp, 150 ep, and 1,000 gp.

The ninth sack examined contains six pieces of silver jewelry (worth 50 gp each) and eight pieces of gold jewelry (worth 100 gp each).

The first barrel opened contains a collection of skulls.

Hidden under the tenth pile of skins are two *potions of healing* and an armband made of gold fabric with a clasp fashioned from ivory and amber sculpted in the form of a bear. The armband is worth 500 gp, and it serves as a token of free passage.

### Cavern Guard Post (Areas 9 and 10)
Giants encountered here are always alert (not sleeping). To determine the position of each guard when the characters first enter, roll a d4 twice. Use one of the results as the location of the guard in area 9. Add 4 to the other roll and use it as the location of the guard in area 10. These guards will cooperate and attempt to set up ambushes.

#### 9. Northwest Chamber
One **frost giant** keeps a sharp lookout here. The giant has its greataxe plus a boulder ready at hand, with plenty of additional boulders piled near the entrances (guard positions 1 and 4).

#### 10. Southeast Chamber
One **frost giant** is stationed here. If alerted, the guard moves into area 9 and joins the fray.

***Treasure.*** The guard wears an armband that is a token of free passage like the one described at area 8. Eight bags are piled along the south wall (near guard position 8), each holding 200 gp.

A rock ledge on the southeast wall, 9 feet off the ground, has a stone box atop it. The stone box cannot be seen by a human-sized creature standing on the floor. Inside this box are two more armbands and a pouch of five gems (worth 100 gp each).

***Exit to Lower Level.*** The passage leading west from this area intersects with a down-sloping tunnel that descends 100 feet before opening onto *area 1* of the lower level (see *map 6.4*).

### 11. Cave of Bones
This place is the disposal area for unwanted bodies and similar refuse tossed into the place by the various giants in the upper area. If the characters decide to look through the refuse, it takes 10 minutes to search a 10-foot-square area, and the toads from area 12 come into the place to look for food if they hear any noise. Even if the characters are quiet, there is a cumulative 15 percent chance for every 10 minutes that passes that the toads will come looking for food.

***Treasure.*** Although it certainly appears that some valuables might be scattered among all the bones, in truth there are only a few coins to be had—1d6 each of copper, silver, and gold—and some broken weapons, pottery shards, and the like.

### 12. Lower Bone Cave
This place has many bones and skulls littering it and serves as the lair of five **giant ice toads** (see *appendix B*). These creatures feed on the leavings in area 11. The toads rest on small ledges from 8 to 12 feet above the cave floor, and they will hop down and savagely attack anything that touches it.

***Treasure.*** The creatures have one item of value, a naturally shaped piece of reddish-purple amethyst (worth 1,000 gp) that resembles a toad. It sits on a protuberance in the middle of their cave, and they worship it as a god.

### 13. Ice Cavern
This place is the home of six **yetis** that act as scouts for the frost giants. The **yeti leader** at the location marked A has a *frost brand greatsword*. It fights with this weapon instead of its claws, dealing 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage on a hit, and carving great chunks out of those held fast by his Chilling Gaze.

***Treasure.*** The **yeti leader** has a hoard of eleven ivory tusks, each weighing 2 pounds and worth 200 gp, buried under a mound of snow.

### 14. Misty Ice Cave
Escaping hot air from somewhere beneath filters into this place through numerous cracks in the floor, making it full of damp, cold fog. The cracks are about 1 foot wide, not enough to hamper movement. The fog renders the area heavily obscured, and the floor is very slippery.

A creature hit by an attack when on the slippery ice or that moves more than half its speed over the ice must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If a character's save fails by 5 or more, the character drops an object in hand, which falls into one of the cracks. The object tumbles somewhere into the bowels of the earth, forever lost.

### 15. Ice Cave
This is the den of two large snow leopards (use the **tiger** statistics), which serve as pets of the yetis in *area 13*. These creatures lair on a ledge above the floor of the cave, and they try to take intruders by surprise.

### Barracks Complex (Areas 16–19)
This section of the stronghold houses a group of frost giants readying for a raid. Each of the separate areas has piles of hides for sleeping, a table and stools, and a few extra giant-sized weapons around. Each giant here has 2d4 rocks to hurl.

#### 16. Outer Sleeping Area
One **frost giant** resides in the northeast cavern.

#### 17. Upper Sleeping Area
The northwest cave holds one **frost giant**.

#### 18. Middle Sleeping Area
Two **frost giants** occupy the largest of these caverns. At the back of this cave is a clear spring of water about 2 feet deep, at the bottom of which are two hundred seventy-eight clear rock crystals worth 10 gp each.

#### 19. Lower Sleeping Area
One **frost giant** is in the southernmost chamber.

### 20. Ice Storage Cave
This place is full of large and small pieces of frozen meat. Some of the chunks resemble parts of human and other humanoid bodies.

### 21. Ice Cavern
A warning carved into the icy floor in Giant with Dwarvish runes clearly shows that this place is to be shunned. Ten feet beyond where the passage turns to the southwest, the walls appear to be crusted with rough old ivory—in fact, this is an infestation of brown mold (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). The floor is dotted with mounds of what look like old snow with the ends of bones sticking out of them. These are the bony remains of various creatures, covered by the growth.

### 22. Guard Ice Cave
Two **frost giants** are stationed here; one watches at the cave mouth, while the other naps on a pile of hides. Eight throwing rocks are within reach in the cave.

***Treasure.*** Each giant has a sack. No other valuables are present.

### 23. Guard Cave
Two **frost giants** rest here. One giant watches down each passage while the other sleeps on a heap of skins. Each has a weapon and four rocks to hurl.

***Treasure.*** There are four sacks in the cave, but nothing else of value.

***Exit to Lower Level.*** The passage leading east from this area eventually intersects with a down-sloping tunnel that descends 100 feet before opening onto *area 1* of the lower level (see *map 6.4*).

### 24. Visitors' Cave
Two **hill giants** and their three hill giant servants (use the **ogre** statistics) are camped here awaiting a summons from the jarl. The cave has five heaps of hides and five *giant-sized bags*.

***Treasure.*** The fourth bag searched contains a gold-inlayed skull with a report from **Chief Nosnra** to **Jarl Grugnur** on a piece of parchment rolled up inside it. This document serves as a token of free passage to the hall of the fire giants. The biggest hill giant knows that they are bound south to **King Snurre**'s realm after seeing the jarl, intending to take a message to the fire giant king.

In addition, each hill giant wears a fur cloak worth 1,000 gp.

### 25. Visitors' Cave
Two **stone giants** have come to the rift to pay their respects to the jarl and to see how well the frost giants are doing in their war on humankind. They will report their observations to other stone giants if they get the opportunity. They fight only if attacked. Each has a stone greatclub and three rocks handy.

***Treasure.*** Hidden among the piles of skins in the cave is a jeweled platinum crown (worth 3,000 gp) that the stone giants intend to give to the jarl as a gift if he appears to be doing well.

### 26. Special Visitors' Cave
![[009-totyp-06-11.webp|right|300]]

This location is warmed somewhat by volcanic activity and lit by dim reddish light. In it are a **fire giant** messenger and his **fire giant servant** (as a **hill giant** with fire immunity) who have delivered their message and are about to depart for their own land. There are two piles of furs and skins in the place, a rude table, a bench, three stools, a large brazier, and two sacks.

***Treasure.*** One giant's sack contains 1,500 gp and the other 500 gp, in addition to the usual contents. In a padded bag at his belt, the messenger carries a symbol of the jarl's fealty to **King Snurre**: a solid silver statue of a bear, rampant, with topaz eyes (worth 1,500 gp).

### 27. Winter Wolf Pack
Along the western side of the rift floor is the lair of a pack of five **winter wolves**. The wolves are encouraged to roam the place by the frost giants.

### 28. Snow-Covered Dome of Ice
This hollowed-out ice formation has been created by the creature that lairs inside—a **remorhaz** that has recently moved into the rift. A number of charred skeletons are strewn around its icy den.

### 29. White Puddings
The two spots marked with numbers along the east edge of the rift floor are the locations of a pair of Huge white puddings. A white pudding uses the statistics for a **black pudding**, and its coloration gives it perfect camouflage in these icy conditions. While a white pudding remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a mound of snow.

## Lower Level: General Features
Map 6.4 shows the layout of the lower level of the glacial rift. This area has basically natural formations, with some rough-hewn connecting passages and enlargements made here and there.

![[014-atg04-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)***Boulders.*** Some passageways on this level are blocked by huge boulders (at the places adjacent to boulders that are marked B on the map). For Medium or smaller creatures, moving these obstructions out of the way requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

***Ceilings.*** Passages have ceilings that are about 25 feet high. Ceilings of small caverns are 30 to 40 feet high, and those of the large caves 45 to 60 feet.

***Illumination.*** Light in this area comes from torches and from cressets that are actually cages for **giant fire beetles** (the latter mostly in the part inhabited by the jarl).

### Random Encounters
On the lower level of the frost giant stronghold, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, roll a d10. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- One **frost giant**, a guard making the rounds
- 1d4 + 1 **ogres** on an errand for the jarl
- One **frost giant** and two **ogres** servants out for a walk
- If the giants know intruders are about, one **frost giant** and three **winter wolves** search for those intruders.

## Lower Level Locations
The following locations are identified on map 6.4.

### 1. Grand Entry Cavern
The entrance to the lower level is obviously meant to be impressive, as its walls bear carvings of battle and hunting scenes in bas-relief. These carved scenes show giants slaying enemies, hunting dragons and other fearsome monsters, and engaged in similar activities. Torches burn at intervals along the length of the cavern.

Survivors of attacks on the level above will most likely make a stand in the grand entry cavern if they are still in relatively good shape.

***Secret Exits.*** The boulders that close off the passages to the east and west are well concealed and look much like the normal cavern walls, so each must be discovered by characters as though it were a secret door.

### 2. Vaulted Cavern
The noise of moving the boulder that closes the place off from the rest of the complex awakens a mated pair of **young white dragons** that are kept here, along with a great pile of treasure. If they have enough warning, both the dragons hide and wait to see who enters.

The only intruders that the dragons do not object to are frost giants coming to feed them or bearing treasure to add to the dragons' hoard. Unless the male dragon is hiding, he sits proudly atop a heap of valuable items in the north end of the cavern. The female rests nearby on a ledge that projects from the western wall of the chamber (see area 2A).

***Treasure.*** The dragons' hoard includes the following items:

- 15,000 sp and 12,400 gp in loose coinage
- Eight silver boxes filled with ivory (weighing 20 pounds apiece, each box worth 300 gp plus 100 gp for the ivory inside it)
- An alabaster statue depicting a winged woman (a deva), worth 800 gp
- Seven white marble statues of no great worth
- A scattering of three hundred fifty gems, worth 1 gp each
- Eleven pewter serving pieces of small worth
- Twenty-four various weapons (a *+2 dagger* among them)
- Nine *shields*
- Eight suits of armor (including a silvered set of *+2 chain mail*)
- Twenty-seven urns of small value
- Sixty-one bottles and flasks, valueless except for one that holds a *potion of poison*, another that is a *potion of resistance (fire)*, and two more that hold *potions of diminution* and *growth* respectively

### 2A. Dragon's Ledge
A ledge about 30 feet above the floor of the cavern has a cave-like nook at the back. On the elevated area, the female dragon hides and watches. If roused to action, she joins the battle as stealthily as she can.

***Treasure.*** The female has hidden twelve gems worth 250 gp each (eight opals and four diamonds) behind her on the ledge.

### 3. Abandoned Storage Cave
The place contains some remnants of carcasses, a few broken boxes with spoiled provisions, some split sacks containing moldering grain, casks of wine turned to vinegar, and ale barrels that have been stove in.

If any of the denizens from above fled to this level and are injured or were being hotly pursued, they attempt to avoid notice by hiding in this storeroom.

### 4. Deserted Cavern
Broken items of giant-sized furniture litter this place—the remnants of tables, benches, stools, and chairs. Soot-covered wall cressets hold burned-out torches. Three skeletons of frost giants are plainly visible near the center of the cavern.

***Treasure.*** Loose coins amounting to 500 gp, spilled from a rotted sack, are scattered around the frost giant skeletons. Note that the monsters at *area 4B* will attack any creatures that poke around in these bones.

### 4A. Stone Rubble
A frost giant skeleton rests in the far south end of the chamber, half-buried under stone rubble. It appears that the giant was trying to flee from the cave-in of a passage to the south (behind the rubble) but failed to make it and was killed by falling rocks.

***Treasure.*** One of the giant's skeletal hands clutches an iron tube containing a map that shows areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the lower level. *Area 1* is labeled (in Common) as "Grand Entry," *area 2* as "Storage Place," *area 3* as "Provisions," and *area 4* as "Great Hall of the Jarl." The map also shows a passage leading south from this chamber (along the way now blocked by rubble), which after some 60 feet reaches a complex of caves and caverns, including various barracks room, the jarl's private chambers, and a treasure room.

This map is actually a fake, a ruse perpetrated by the jarl to mislead would-be robbers. If the characters attempt to dig out the rubble to find the supposed treasure room, they succeed only in making a lot of noise—no passage beyond can be unearthed.

### 4B. Hungry and Hopping
Six **giant ice toads** (see *appendix B*) lair in the northern extreme of this chamber. They are very hungry and seek to kill and devour any creatures that enter the cavern, forcing themselves to wait only long enough for intruders to be distracted by the glint of gold and lure of bone in the center of the main cavern.

### 5. Entrance Cavern
Hidden by a camouflaged boulder from prying eyes, this chamber is the actual entrance to the jarl's complex. It is always guarded by a **frost giant** equipped with a weapons and throwing stones, plus a *giant's bag*. If a conflict erupts, the giant tries to sound a great iron horn suspended from the ceiling on iron chains in the center of the cavern. The giant has to use an action to blow the horn.

### 6. Emissaries' Cavern
An **oni** and its four **ogre** servants are staying here. They have had an audience with the jarl, and after a special wassail to be held on the morrow they will depart for home with a treaty scroll. This scroll is signed (with a special mark) by the jarl and offers the Lord of the Oni 25,000 gp worth of gems, plus whatever loot the lord's minions garner, if they will join the war on humankind.

***Treasure.*** The oni wears a *necklace of fireballs* with five beads remaining that it will not hesitate to use. The oni also bears a pouch containing six 500 gp gems (gifts from the jarl).

A small iron casket among the oni's belongings holds a gift to the Lord of Oni—a trick box made out of eighteen plates of platinum, eighteen plates of electrum, and eighteen plates of silver. The box is opened by sliding certain plates on the left side, then the top, then the right side in a particular sequence. The correct order is platinum–electrum–silver on each end, and silver–electrum–platinum on the top.

The box has properties similar to those of a *bag of holding*—although the container is but 10 inches long by 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, it holds 3 cubic feet of material or 60 pounds, whichever is the lesser. At present the box contains 500 gp, a *potion of mind control* (frost giant) (see *appendix A*), and a *potion of cloud giant strength*.

### 7. Guest Cavern
A torch-lit place adorned with tapestries, this comfortable chamber has skins and hides covering the floor and a bed heaped with soft pelts. Furnishings include a chest, a bag, a table, two chairs, and a small cabinet. The **cloud giant** who is the current guest has just agreed to join the jarl as his chief henchman.

***Treasure.*** The chest holds 2,200 gp, and the giant wears a silver belt set with ivory and gems (worth 600 gp).

### 8. Prison Cavern
Torches light the place dimly. A female **storm giant** is chained on the north wall with huge manacles at her wrists and ankles. A fur rug in the middle of the place bears a table and two chairs. Upon the table are heaps of food on six golden platters and in three silver bowls. Two huge flagons of ivory set with gems have been filled with fine wine; the scents from the food and the wine fill the chamber.

These refreshments have been set out to tantalize the giant into submitting to the jarl's will and becoming his leman, but she has not been won over—quite the opposite is true. Being subjected to this durance vile makes her a friend to any who rescue her, although she despises evil. Thus, the presence of evil characters in the party will cause her to fulfill her obligation as quickly as possible and depart. By contrast, she might strike up a long-term friendship with a party of good-aligned characters.

***Treasure.*** The platters are worth 500 gp each, the bowls 50 gp apiece, and the flagons have a value of 100 gp each.

### 9. Servants' Quarters Cavern
Eight **ogres** dwell here. Each has its own pile of hides and rags for sleeping, a wooden box for goods, a peg to hang outer garments, and a bag. The ogres serve the jarl willingly and fight fiercely.

***Treasure.*** Each ogre has 1d100 sp, 1d100 ep, and 1d100 gp in its box or its bag.

### 10. Antecavern
A **frost giant** guard is alert inside this oblong cavern at all times. He has a greataxe and one throwing rock. He shouts to alert the guards to the south if intruders enter the area.

### 11. Great Cavern of the Jarl
This is where all the special functions and feasts hosted by the jarl take place. Various tables and benches line the east and west walls, pushed out of the way for now until they are needed. Caged fire beetles dimly illuminate the place, which appears to be deserted.

***Guard Posts.*** The ledges marked A and B are more than 30 feet above the floor and hidden in dark shadow. Each of the ledges holds a watchful **frost giant** with a supply of six rocks to throw.

### 12. Audience Alcove and Throne Dais
A stone outcrop partially encloses an area in the south of the jarl's cavern. A enormous ivory and bone throne, decorated with skulls, silver, and gems, rests near the south wall of this alcove. Hung behind it, spread out against the rough wall, is a white dragon hide. Before the throne on the floor is the skin of a **huge polar bear**. Three ivory stools are off to one side of the throne; these are the seats of the jarl's lieutenants.

***Treasure.*** The gems that decorate the throne consist of sixty worth 50 gp each, fifteen worth 100 gp each, three of 500 gp value, and one 1,000 gp gem.

### 13. Guard Area
One **frost giant** guard stationed in the far southern end of this chamber looks east and west at varying times. He has two rocks. If an intruder is seen, he will sound a large gong on the north wall (possibly with a thrown rock).

### 14. Kitchen
Two fire giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) and four **ogres** labor in the kitchen, roasting a horse over the natural firepit and otherwise readying the jarl's food. Various foodstuffs, furniture, and utensils are scattered about in all the nooks that lead away from the firepit. Amid heaps of foodstuffs to the north are four human captives (**commoners**) in a cage, being saved for a feast. They can warn the characters about what lies in areas 15, 16, and 17.

### 15. Weapons Cave
Herein are stored sixty-two throwing rocks, eight shields, fifteen spears, five clubs, and five helmets, all of frost giant size. The cave also holds six battleaxes (which the giants can hurl) and a well-made chain shirt of giant size.

### 16. Common Quarters Caverns
Currently one **frost giant**, two frost giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to cold damage), and three young frost giants (use the **ogre** statistics, plus immunity to cold damage) call this place home. If the frost giant is killed, the others weepily surrender, not fighting thereafter unless they are attacked.

In addition to the giants, the room holds piles of skins and hides, a few stools, eleven large boxes, five chests, and many pegs (currently with fourteen capes and nine bags hanging from them).

***Treasure.*** Under the ninth box moved by the characters is a hole in the floor that contains 3,500 gp.

### 17. Kennel Cave
The jarl's hunting pack—four huge **polar bears** with 65 hit points each—lairs here.

***Treasure.*** Each bear wears a gem-studded collar worth 200 gp.

### Caverns of the Carls (areas 18-19)
Two large caverns provide quarters for the frost giant gentry. Each inhabitant has a cot, a chest, a chair or a stool, and several hides and skins for bedding. The whole area is lit by torches and a few fire beetles, with many pegs holding cloaks, capes, and bags along the walls. Three huge lockers, three hampers, and six wardrobes make up the rest of the furnishings. The giants, some of them warriors and some of them servants, are willing to negotiate to protect the young, which they fight to the death to protect or avenge.

***Treasure.*** Each giant warrior in the place has 1,000 gp plus an armband that is a token of free passage (identical to the one described at *area 8* of the upper level). Each other adult giant has 500 gp. The young have no treasure.

#### 18. West Chamber
This large cave is occupied by two **frost giants** and three frost giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to cold damage) along with three young frost giants (use the **ogre** statistics, plus immunity to cold damage).

#### 19. East Chamber
This slightly smaller area holds one **frost giant**, one **frost giant servant**, and two young frost giants.

### 20. Jarl's Antecavern and Trophy Hall
**Jarl Grugnur** receives visitors in a chamber on the southern edge of the lower level. The eastern half of the cavern is a private audience hall, with pelts and skins on the walls and floor, a table, and four chairs. Some worthless scrolls are on the table, and on the walls of this area hang two normal shields, a heavy crossbow, two normal two-handed swords, and a pair of huge ivory tusks of no value. A few worthless furs and tapestries hang on the short sections of wall to the north. Both halves of the hall are illuminated by caged fire beetles. To the east a set of well-worn steps, each about 3 feet high, lead up to an exit screened by thick, leathery hides.

![[011-totyp-06-12.webp|right|300]]

The western spur of the chamber is the jarl's trophy hall. Here, the jarl often sits in a comfortable chair and ruminates over past glories and future plans; the floor in this area has actual rugs. The walls of the alcove are adorned with a host of trophies, including a cave bear pelt of enormous size, a wyvern skin, the rack from a giant stag, the mandibles and claws of an umber hulk, giant scorpion claws, the horn of a woolly rhinoceros, a pair of mammoth tusks, a pair of mastodon tusks, a giant boar head, a griffon skin, the wings of a giant eagle, a giant lynx pelt, and the jaws from a subterranean lizard,

***Treasure.*** In addition to all the trophies of kills mentioned above, the place holds several items that are valuable or potentially useful. Many of them are weapons or armor of normal (nonmagical) sort, including:

- A bow and a quiver with sixteen arrows
- Three *shields*
- A *light crossbow* and fourteen bolts
- A *greataxe*, two *spears*, and a *flail*
- A huge iron mace
- A suit of *splint armor* sized for a dwarf
- A suit of *plate armor* sized for a human

Other items of interest, because of their magical nature or unusual appearance, are as follows:

- A *+1 shield* that is trapped (see below)
- The skull of a dwarf wearing an iron crown (no value)
- Eleven *+1 bolts*
- Two walrus tusks that are trapped (see below), one of which is an ivory-covered bronze *horn of Valhalla*
- A white dragon skull that has an aura of abjuration magic about it
- A suit of *+1 plate armor* sized for an elf
- Three elaborate tapestries (one worth 400 gp, anoher valued at 100 gp, and one that is worthless)

***Trapped Shield.*** If the magic shield is taken down from the wall, that act releases a spear trap that fires straight ahead to a range of 60 feet. The spear has a +10 bonus to hit and deals 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a hit. The trap mechanism can be seen by someone who examines the shield and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Given 1 minute or so, a character who uses thieves' tools and succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check can jam the mechanism so the spear can't launch. If the check fails by 5 or more, the spear launches even if the shield is still on the wall.

***Trapped Tusks.*** If either of the walrus tusks is touched, the dragon skull screams "Alarm! Robbers!" in Giant until the skull is smashed to pieces, which continue to quietly whimper for some time thereafter.

### 21. Jarl Grugnur's Private Cavern
The chief of the frost giants and his lady reside in a secluded chamber on the southeast edge of the stronghold's lower level.

***Living Area.*** The western part of this chamber contains a huge table, four chairs, three wardrobes, five chests, five trunks, and seven coffers. The walls are hung with heavy tapestries and various pelts and skins, all of no particular worth.

**Jarl Grugnur** (use the **cloud giant** statistics, plus immunity to cold damage but without Keen Smell and Innate Spellcasting) sits at the table in his chain mail jack with his *arrow-catching shield* nearby (AC 18, or AC 20 against ranged attacks, with his shield; AC 16 without it). At his hip is his *+2 longsword*. The jarl has a +14 bonus to hit with the weapon and deals 23 (3d8 + 10) slashing damage on a hit. In his hand is a platinum drinking horn set with eight gems.

Across the table is **Estia**, his lady (use the **cloud giant** statistics, altered as for Grugnur), a fierce beauty with a cloak of saber-tooth tiger hide about her and an iron *+2 morningstar* at her hip. On the table in front of her is a gold flagon set with eight gems (1,200 gp).

Two **winter wolves** are crouched under the table.

***Treasure.*** The jarl's drinking horn has a value of 2,000 gp, and his lady's flagon is worth 1,200 gp.

All the various containers in the room contain clothing and other unremarkable items, except as follows:

- The second chest searched holds 700 pp.
- The fifth chest has 3,200 gp.
- The fourth trunk has a thick layer of old socks, underneath which are eight potions (*speed*, *superior healing*, *storm giant strength*, *poison*, *oil of slipperiness*, *healing*, and a *philter of love*).
- The second coffer has nine pieces of jewelry (worth 1,000 gp each).
- The sixth coffer holds one hundred ninety-eight gems (one hundred four worth 10 gp each, fifty-one of 50 gp, thirty-six of 100 gp, six of 250 gp, and one of 1,000 gp value).

***Sleeping Area.*** The eastern portion of the cavern is partially screened off by hangings. This cozy nook holds a rumpled bed, a small table, a chair, two stools, a chest, a trunk, and various odds and ends of clothing, armor, and weapons here and there. The walls are hung with pelts and rugs of no particular value.

***Treasure.*** The lid of the trunk has a secret drawer in it that contains six scroll tubes. The jarl will take these items if he is forced to flee and has time to get them. The contents of the tubes are as follows:

- Number 1 is empty.
- Number 2 holds a key to the invisible chest in the hidden escape tunnel (see below).
- Number 3 contains a map marking the location of the Hall of the Fire Giant King.
- Number 4 holds a *scroll of protection* (fiends).
- Number 5 contains a scroll of gibberish with an *explosive runes* *glyph of warding* on it (spell save DC 15).
- Number 6 has two *spell scrolls*, one of *delayed blast fireball* and one of *finger of death*.

### Hidden Escape Tunnel
Behind the wall hangings in the northeast end of the chamber is a natural passage about a mile long that turns south and exits at the base of the glacier, out of sight of anyone near the rift. Someone who looks around the room can notice the opening in the wall through gaps in the hangings with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Someone who handles the hangings in this area or looks behind them finds the opening without needing a check.

The alcove to the northwest just inside the tunnel has a thick iron bar protruding from the wall about 10 feet off the ground. To a casting of *detect magic*, the bar has a strong aura of conjuration. Noticing the bar without specifically looking up for it requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception check). If the bar is pushed downward, that act transports whatever or whoever is standing on the floor of the alcove to a spot some 50 feet distant from the entrance to Snurre's hall (the Hall of the Fire Giant King).

An apparently empty ledge high in the southwest wall is the resting place of an iron box that is invisible, has no magical aura, and is locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Dexterity check to open). Those who investigate the ledge can find the box only if they blunder into it or they are able to see invisible objects. The chest becomes visible when opened. It has a *glyph of warding* (save DC 17) inside the lid. The glyph triggers if the chest is opened without its key. If triggered, the glyph casts *cloudkill* (spell save DC 17) centered on itself. The box's contents are meant to be taken to the fire giants' stronghold and given as gifts to the powers behind the uprising.

***Treasure.*** In the iron box are a *pearl of power*, a set of *Nolzur's marvelous pigments*, and a *wand of paralysis*.

## Running the Adventure
As with the previous adventures in this series, it is up to you to add to the considerable detail given herein, filling in any needed information to color the whole and bring it to life. You, as Dungeon Master, must continue to improvise and create, for your players will certainly desire more specifics, seek to do things not provided for herein, and generally defy expectation. The script is here, but you will direct the whole, rewrite parts, and sit in final judgment on characters' actions.

If you have already taken your players through the first two adventures, be particularly mindful of how their behavior there will have altered what is described here. Use the parameters given to design your own epic. Be disinterested, and be just. This is a very difficult scenario, and the players might rue thoughtless actions, but do not allow this reaction to temper what you have before you. Likewise, do not set about to entrap the characters in a hopeless situation—allow their actions to dictate their fate.

Remember also that these giants are not only the toughest so far encountered but also have the best advice immediately available to them. As soon as the party strikes and then retires, the attack will be assessed and countermeasures taken. Even when the party first enters the hall, you will have to gauge the reaction of the giants if and when they learn that intruders are within. How will they react? From whence will they call in guards? Where will Snurre go? Most assuredly, he will not remain seated upon his throne when an attack is in progress! You have not ceased being a Dungeon Master by using this prepared scenario; you have simply had some details handled for you so that you can better script the more important material.

When the party retires from the hall to rest, the fire giants will lay whatever traps and ambushes they are able to prepare under the circumstances. Lights will be smothered, sentries posted, and so forth. In the original playtest, the giants who survived the first foray by the (exceptionally strong and well-played) party set several ambushes, each surprise being timed to allow them to retreat quickly behind a turn in a passage or through a set of doors, gradually falling back to the corridor to the lower level. While the characters offered no quarter and slew every giant or other creature encountered with absolute ruthlessness, their opponents fought with reckless abandon and self-sacrifice.

How you manage this conflict in your game must be based on knowledge that only you can have. The upshot of this whole series of adventures is a fight to the finish. Only the leaders and those they take with them will normally seek to move to a place of safety; the rest will stand fast and battle to the end.

### Adventure Start
The party might have arrived before the huge obsidian valves that bar entrance to the hall by means of the transporter found in the lair of the frost giant jarl. In this case, they will have to search to find a place of safety to rest and recover their strength between forays into the hall.

If the group journeyed hence by some other method, they will have noted such a place of refuge about two miles distant from Snurre's sooty palace. This hidden site should initially prove to be safe from detection as long as the characters leave no plain trail to it and as long as they are not followed to it. There is a limit, though, to how far they can push their luck. Each time they venture forth from their refuge to raid the fire giant hall, there is a 10 percent cumulative chance that the hidey-hole will be found by the giants (a 10 percent chance after the first raid, 20 percent following the second, and so forth).

A nearby ravine leads directly from the safe cave to the spiny, broken heap of slag indicated on the characters' map as the site of the hall. A wide, well-trod path winds its way across the barren land up to two great slabs of black stone—the obsidian portals that give access to Snurre's hall. Each valve is 29 feet tall, 10 feet wide, and no less than 3 feet thick. Normal human strength cannot even budge them; for Medium or smaller creatures to open them requires at least two characters working together to make a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. On the second and any successive raids upon the place, there is a 50 percent likelihood that the gates will be ajar, and some guard will be watching for attackers in order to alert the hall.

The plain around the stronghold is most evil and drab in appearance. The sky is gray and filled with sooty clouds. A distant volcano can be seen, and far to the south a glowing river of molten lava moves sluggishly down a slope and out of sight. The air is hot and smells of heated rock and metal. The ground is covered with cinders and sharp rocks that make walking cross-country difficult (and noisy). The area is lit by night with dim red light, both from flaming gases that shoot forth out of the bowels of the earth and from the glow of molten rock.

The pile of lava, slag, and jutting black rock that houses the Hall of Snurre is a steeply rising hill about 300 feet high at its summit. It is difficult to scale. Smoking vents are everywhere, and some of these holes spurt out jets of flame from time to time. The characters will never locate any entrance into the place other than by the main gate, and there is a 33 percent chance that any member investigating a vent hole will be struck by flaming gases for 7 (2d6) fire damage.

## Entrance Level: General Features
Map 6.5 shows the layout of the uppermost level of the fire giant stronghold. The floors, walls, and ceilings throughout the place are of black, reddish-black, dark gray, and dull brown rock. In some places the stone has been hewn, but in others it appears to have been fused by heat.

![[017-atg05-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)***Ceilings.*** Passageways in the hall have vaulted ceilings 30 feet high. Caves, chambers, and rooms are 40 to 60 feet high.

***Doors.*** All doors are made of iron plates. A Medium or smaller creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to open any of the doors in this place due to their great size and weight. Doors stay open if left that way.

***Illumination.*** The upper level of Snurre's hall is lit by torches, braziers, and natural gas jets.

***Locks.*** The hall contains numerous well-made locks. Someone using thieves' tools can pick a lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

***Secret Doors.*** Secret doors in the hall are precisely crafted. Unless otherwise noted, it requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door.

### Random Encounters
On the entrance level of the fire giant stronghold, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, roll a d12. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- One **fire giant** guard
- One **fire giant** with 12 **gnoll** workers
- Four young fire giants (use the **ogre** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) with two **hell hounds**
- One **cloud giant**, one **frost giant**, or one **stone giant**, a visitor looking around

## Entrance Level Locations
The following locations are identified on map 6.5.

### 1. Entry Passage
The floor here is polished obsidian, and great wall hangings can be seen by the characters as soon as they enter. The tapestries displayed between the torches are rendered in bloody colors and show victorious fire giants. The door guard is hidden in the alcove (area 1A).

### 1A. Alcove
The tapestry that covers the opening to this guard post is of loose weave, allowing the **fire giant** guard in the dark recess to clearly see whoever enters the corridor. If intruders are spotted, he sounds his great bronze horn to warn the hall (see area 2). The giant has four rocks for throwing.

If the characters are returning after severely defeating the giants, a ballista (from the arsenal at *10A*) will be set up at the far end of the hallway in anticipation of a second raid. This weapon is triggered by a nearly invisible tripwire set 30 feet inside the entrance, and someone must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find the wire. Once the wire is found, it can be avoided, but cutting it sets off the ballista. The ballista fires an array of bolts down the length of the hall, so each creature in it is subjected to one attack at a +6 bonus to hit, dealing 11 (2d10) piercing damage on a hit.

### 2. Grand Hall
Two **ettins** are always in the hall that runs east–west off the entry passage, using their four heads to watch in all directions. If the guard at the gate sounds the alarm, these creatures move to hold the mouth of the entryway until help arrives from area 3, *area 18*, or *areas 21*–*25*.

The floor of the grand hall is of reddish-black, highly polished stone. The pillars are carved into the shapes of dwarves, each straining to hold up the figure atop it. Light flickers weirdly from burning gases that spurt from the walls. One of the tapestries on the south wall screens the entrance to the royal apartment (*areas 4*–*7*).

### 3. Throne Room and Audience Chamber
![[013-totyp-06-14.webp|right|300]]

Two steps of white-veined black marble lead up to an area where the floor is of deep red polished stone, Between two pillars of polished obsidian sits a massive throne made of jet and black-and-white-banded onyx, the whole inlaid with various large gems. The walls are inlaid with colored stone laid out to show various scenes of victory by **King Snurre** over his foes. On the wall directly behind the throne is depicted the flaming skull which is Snurre's own device, flanked by fire giants with clubs over their shoulders. The northern one of these inlaid giant-images conceals a secret door hidden in the wall; a cresset to the left of it, when pulled down, causes the portal to swing inward.

**King Snurre** is seated on the black seat of the throne. Over 19 feet tall, he is hugely muscled and extraordinarily ugly—very broad, with bandy legs. His teeth are tusk-like and protruding, his side whiskers and beard bright orange and full. Snurre is clad in black iron plate armor, and he wields a huge greatsword that displays flames running along its blade when it is swung. The king wears a necklace of coral skulls and has a broad girdle set with small gems. Around his shoulders is a cape made of white dragon hide.

When he sits on the throne, he wears his jewel-studded crown of iron. Otherwise the crown is in his bag and his bald pate covered by an iron helmet.

**King Snurre** is a **fire giant** with the following changes, which increase his challenge rating to 11 (7,200 XP):

- He has 187 (15d12 + 90) hit points.
- He has resistance to cold damage.
- He can speak Common and Giant.
- His greatsword deals an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage on a hit.

Two **fire giants** guard the king at all times; their positions are indicated by the circled numbers 1 and 2. Each giant has a carved stone to throw. Crouching at positions 3 and 4 are a pair of **hell hounds**, the king's constant companions.

***Treasure.*** Snurre's crown is set with six rubies (worth 500 gp each), six diamonds (500 gp each), and a huge jacinth (1,000 gp). His necklace has a value of 1,000 gp, and his girdle is decorated with sixty-six garnets (worth 10 gp each). His magic cape grants resistance to cold damage.

The gems embedded in Snurre's throne include twelve pieces of sard (worth 100 gp each), twelve fire opals (worth 250 gp each), and twelve rubies (500 gp each).

### 4. Chamber of the Queen's Servants
The walls of the grand hall are covered with hide rugs and wall hangings, one of which screens the entrance to the queen's private chamber.

Inside this entryway are torches on the walls, and six chairs and three small tables along the hallway. At the end of the route westward is a chamber that holds four beds, four chests, two wardrobes, and four stools.

Three fire giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) are present here, one waiting outside the queen's chamber and two more in the end chamber. Each fights fiercely to protect the queen, with those at the end chamber rushing to aid the other. The servants wield longswords that deal 18 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage on a hit.

***Treasure.*** Each of the servants wears three pieces of jewelry worth 250 gp apiece. Amid the eighty-one hides, pelts, skins, and furs in the end chamber are five of value—the seventeenth, twenty-fourth, fortieth, fifty-ninth, and seventy-seventh items that the characters examine are worth 200 gp each.

### 5. Queen's Chamber
The floors and walls in the chamber north of the servants' quarters are covered with rich rugs and tapestries of no great value. The place is well lit by torches and a large brazier, and this makes it very hot indeed (just right for fire giants!).

Queen Frupy, who resides here, is a veritable harridan, a sly and cunning **fire giant**. She is, if anything, uglier than Snurre. Topped by a huge mass of yellow-orange hair that looks like a fright wig, Queen Frupy's face is a mass of jowls and wrinkles set in the middle of a very large head that seems to grow directly out of her shoulders without the benefit of any neck. Her body is lumpy and gross, her skin covered with bristles the color of her hair. Her little pig eyes, however, are bright, suggesting intelligence unusual in a giant.

Her chamber contains a giant-sized bed covered with furs, a table and two chairs, a stool, and a dressing table with a huge *mirror of seeing* (weighing 100 pounds) that functions similarly to a *gem of seeing*, so that even unseen creatures and objects are reflected in it. (Frupy uses it if she suspects invisible creatures are about.) Also here are an ebony and mother-of-pearl wardrobe (filled with her clothing), an iron strongbox, a chest of twelve drawers, four small coffers of copper on the table, and two bronze caskets. Each bronze casket has a **poisonous snake** inside, which must be dealt with before the contents can be accessed (see "Treasure").

The queen wears garments of black dragon hide set with iron studs (giving her an AC equivalent to that of plate armor). She wields an iron scepter as a weapon (treat as a maul with the same statistics as a fire giant's greatsword, except that it deals bludgeoning damage). Out of sight under the bed are Frupy's two pets, a pair of **giant weasels** that obey her every command.

If intruders enter the place, Queen Frupy will command them to kneel in her august presence and state their business, so that she may fairly address their humble requests. Any who are so foolish as to do so will be sorry, as Frupy will call forth her pets and herself strike at the intruder who appears to be the most powerful. (A kneeling character is considered to be prone in this situation.) She will then bellow for her servants to come to her aid.

***Treasure.*** One of the bronze caskets holds 400 cp, and the other one has 300 pp concealed beneath a layer of 100 cp.

If the lid of the strongbox is opened by anyone but Frupy, a *glyph of warding* inside is triggered, producing a *fireball* spell centered on the chest (save DC 15). The strongbox itself holds nothing of value, but it has a trick panel in the side, which requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.

The panel, if opened, allows access to a jade box (worth 500 gp). This box has a false bottom, found with another successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, that contains *spell scrolls* of two random 7th-level spells of a particular class (DM's choice).

All but one of the copper coffers contain unguents and the like; the third coffer examined contains four pieces of gem-set gold jewelry worth 750 gp each.

The drawers in the chest hold worthless personal articles, except for the fifth drawer from the bottom, where under some underthings Queen Frupy has concealed three potions: *resistance (fire)*, *mind control (mammal)*, and *mind control (fire giant)*, the latter of which she plans to use on the king (see *appendix A* for the latter two potions).

Finally, Frupy wears six pieces of gem-set jewelry worth 500 gp each.

### 6. Chamber of the King's Guards
Beyond the doors that lead north, along the east and west walls of the short hallway, are a total of twelve throwing rocks lined up ready for use. Two **fire giants**, off-duty guards, relax in the adjoining chamber. Each has a carved throwing rock and a greatsword nearby.

A table and two benches sit in the center of the room. The table has several platters and flagons on it, along with a small cask of wine and a wheel of cheese covered with mold. Two wooden lockers are tucked under the table.

***Treasure.*** Hidden inside the cheese in a hollowed-out space are five 100 gp gems. (This is the repository for the wealth of the on-duty guards.)

Each of the lockers contains ordinary clothing and 150 gp. Each guard carries three gems worth 100 gp each in a belt pouch,

### 7. King Snurre's Private Quarters
The great iron doors to this place bear the blazon of the flaming skull also found in the throne room. The doors open into an outer hall where six **hell hounds** roam.

The walls in the outer hall are set with torches in cressets and draped with crude tapestries. Six chairs and two benches lie along the walls, along with three tables—each with a keg of ale, beer, or mead and drinking vessels of horn or leather at hand. A small step up on either side of a natural stone column of reddish stone marks the end of the outer hall and the entry to the king's private chamber.

The bedchamber of the king is lit in an eerie manner by flaming jets of gas and a huge iron brazier full of glowing coals. The room contains a huge, fur-covered bed, a table, a small throne of ebony and three lesser chairs, a tall cabinet, four trunks, an iron chest at the foot of the bed, and a bench near the entry. The floor is covered with pelts, and the walls are hung with tapestries and trophies: two shields, an axe, four swords, a flail, and a hammer. All these items are sized for giants. A ledge on the south wall 9 feet above the floor holds thirty-nine skulls (human, dwarf, elf, giant, and other various and sundry creatures), eight helmets and helms, and five sets of armor (chain mail, splint, or plate as you desire).

The containers in the room hold the personal gear of **King Snurre**, consisting of clothing, footwear, and bits of armor. Arrayed on the table are several small items including pieces of carved ivory, animal teeth, bits of wood, and stones. Together these items, the king believes, can be made to serve as a divination device.

***Treasure.*** Aside from all the mundane armor and weapons, the only item of value to be had here is one of the stones on the table, which is an uncarved piece of carnelian worth 100 gp.

***Secret Exit.*** A stone projects out of the wall to the left of the secret door, 12 feet above the floor. Pushing the stone in causes the portal to pivot, revealing an opening 10 feet wide and 10 feet high.

### 8. Hydra Cave
A **hydra** lurks in either the north or the south alcove of this area if it hears any creature coming up the steps toward its lair. The creature is very vicious, as the king beats it and torments it for fun, and it hopes to take revenge on virtually any other living thing.

### 9. King Snurre's Treasure Cave
The chamber to the west of the hydra's lair is filled with stuff, much of which is valueless or nearly so—a pile of 2,800 cp, three mounds of 4d4 worthless tapestries and furs, several dozen bales of valueless cloth, scores of various vessels and containers, and urns and vases of pewter and brass and bronze, plus ten urns of silver (worth 50 gp each) and two of gold (worth 500 gp each).

A chimney in the southeastern part of the cave leads up through the roof.

***Treasure.*** The real wealth in the room is held inside nearly twenty different containers—eight iron trunks, six smaller chests, and five even smaller coffers. As the characters investigate and attempt to open them, they discover features and contents as follows. Opening a locked one requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

**Trunk 1** is locked. It contains 7,200 sp.

**Trunk 2** is locked. It contains nothing.

**Trunk 3** is unlocked and has no defenses. At the bottom is a sack holding ten pieces of jewelry (worth 500 gp each). It is buried under a heap of 6,000 cp.

**Trunk 4** is locked and trapped. It contains 3 cubic feet of silk, worth 300 gp per cubic foot. If the trunk is opened without the key, a blade springs from the lid and chops down at one target, with a +11 bonus to hit and dealing 13 (3d8) slashing damage on a hit. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot alterations to the lock and hinges that are part of the trap mechanism. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check by someone using thieves' tools can be used to disable the hinge mechanism. If the trap goes off but the blade misses, it chops through 2 cubic feet of the silk, ruining it.

**Trunk 5** is locked. It contains eight pieces of rare wood, each the size of a mace and inlaid with mother-of-pearl (worth 100 gp apiece).

**Trunk 6** is unlocked and has no defenses. It contains 1,300 ep.

**Trunk 7** is locked. It contains ten fine ivory tusks each weighing 5 pounds and worth 150 gp.

**Trunk 8** is unlocked. When it is opened, it initially appears empty because all of its contents are invisible. The chest holds six pieces of jewelry worth 250 gp each as well as nine **poisonous snakes**.

**Chest 1** is unlocked and trapped. If its lid is lifted, poisonous gas billows forth and spreads out to fill a 10-foot-radius area around it. Those within the cloud when it erupts must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until they finish a short or long rest. The chest is empty.

**Chest 2** is locked. It contains worthless rocks.

**Chest 3** is unlocked and trapped. If its lid is lifted before the trap is disabled, acid sprays out from small holes in the sides, splattering anyone within 10 feet of the chest. Those in the affected area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character discovers that the hinges are connected to a valve, disguised as a decoration, that pressurizes the acid in the chest walls. The trap can be disabled by someone who uses thieves' tools and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check.

To determine the contents of the chest, consult *chapter 7* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Roll four times on Magic Item Table A, two times on Table B, two times on Table C, once on Table D, and once on Table E. Any result that is not a potion or a scroll should be disregarded but not rerolled.

**Chest 4** is unlocked and trapped. It contains 1,600 gp. If its lid is lifted before the trap is disabled, numerous spikes shoot forward, backward, and to each side. Each spike has a range of 15 feet and a +11 bonus to hit, dealing 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a hit. Anyone within 15 feet of the chest might be hit. With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices that the hinges are connected to four valves, disguised as decorations, that pressurize the spikes in the chest walls. Thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check can be used to disable the valves.

**Chest 5** is locked. It contains nothing.

**Chest 6** is locked and trapped. It contains a *cloak of elvenkind* and a pair of *boots of elvenkind*. The lock and the chest's handles are coated with oil of taggit (see "*Sample Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character spots the oil. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check, or any character who has proficiency with a poisoner's kit, knows that the oil can be wiped off with alcohol, although doing so without wearing protective clothing is risky, requiring a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. On a failed check, the character is exposed to the poison.

**Coffer 1** is unlocked and trapped. It contains thirty gold rings, one of which is a *ring of protection*. The others are ordinary rings worth 50 gp each. If the treasure is touched before the trap is disabled, a poison needle shoots from the inner side of the coffer, hitting the extremity that was extended. The needle deals 1 piercing damage and delivers a dose of purple worm poison (see "*Sample Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). With a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character discovers the recess in the coffer wall that holds the needle. A character can remove the needle, thereby disabling the trap, by using thieves' tools and making a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

**Coffer 2** is locked. It contains 200 pp concealed beneath a layer of 500 cp.

**Coffer 3** is locked. It holds packets of leaves and seeds and husks—various hot spices worth a total of 100 gp.

**Coffer 4** is unlocked. It contains six small, highly crafted, carved statues of unknown mineral and workmanship. All register as desecrated objects to the scrutiny of Divine Sense or a *detect evil and good* spell. Each idol is associated with a different ability score. While one is carried, its bearer has disadvantage on all d20 rolls involving that particular ability score.

**Coffer 5** is locked. It holds sixteen gems (worth 250 gp each) concealed beneath a layer of two hundred gems worth 10 gp each, further topped by five hundred gems of good size and fine appearance but worth only 1 gp each.

### 10. Arsenal Complex
A **fire giant** is always at the ready inside the entrance to this storage area. If summoned or attacked, the guard fetches the chimera from area 11. The guard has three throwing rocks at hand. Torches provide light, and a bench offers a place to sit down.

***10A. West Arsenal.*** The western wing contains fifteen huge swords, a ballista, twenty spears, three maces, five greataxes, and a quantity of giant-sized throwing rocks.

***Treasure.*** Hidden in the far southwestern corner under the spears are a *+1 longbow* and a quiver of twenty *+1 arrows*.

***10B. East Arsenal.*** The eastern wing has another supply of throwing rocks, five massive clubs, nine fire giant helmets, two chain shirts, eight shields, and eight studded leather jacks—all giant-sized. Eight big barrels of oil are stored along the east side of the area.

***Treasure.*** One of the giant-sized shields is actually a *shield of missile attraction*.

### 11. Chimera Pen
The fire giants keep a **chimera** here. This creature attacks intruders on sight, since it hates everyone except fire giants.

### 12. Advisor's Quarters
A corridor heads westward from the pillared hallway. The corridor and the chamber beyond contain furnishings of various sizes. The smallest of them are a table, a plush chair with a footstool, and a couch. Other items are more or less human-sized, including a long table, two benches, two chairs, and twelve chests. Finally, there are four huge chairs, a table, and a footstool sized for giants. Rugs on the floor, tapestries on the walls, and bronze cressets with flaming torches complete the decor.

Eight **gnolls** servants/bodyguards are lounging in this area, awaiting orders. They obey only the commands of **King Snurre**, Queen Frupy, or the Advisor—who is is a grossly fat but very strong and quite fast renegade mountain dwarf named **Obmi** (see area 12A).

***Treasure.*** The chests contain the treasure of each gnoll (amounting to 50 gp each) plus the gnolls' personal gear. The third, eighth, tenth, and twelfth chests that the characters examine are locked; they contain bottles of wine and spirits.

### 12A. Obmi's Study
![[014-totyp-06-15.webp|right|300]]

The door to this study appears to be locked from the outside, suggesting that the place is vacant (**Obmi** is very clever). He can see through the door by means of a peephole, and if he sees intruders who are battling the gnolls and winning he will yell for them to help him, claiming to be a victim and a prisoner of the giants.

In fact, at first sight, this chamber appears to be a cell rather than a truly comfortable study. **Obmi** is at work in the room, poring over several scrolls atop his plain wooden desk, searching for solutions for the problems besetting his King. The dwarf has been Snurre's advisor for twenty-five years, having spent five years as a slave before that. A case against the north wall contains various maps, scrolls, and papers, all written in Giant or Dwarvish.

If he finds himself at a disadvantage, **Obmi** (use the **assassin** statistics, with 16 Strength and Charisma and the ability to make three melee attacks using Multiattack) tells the characters that the giants have held him—a prince of his people—captive for ten years, trying to trick information out of him or to subvert his loyalty to dwarfdom when torture failed. He further claims that several humans in black robes aid the giants in their questioning. Finally, he asks to be allowed his armor and weapons in order to gain sweet revenge upon Snurre, and he claims to know exactly where the king will be.

While in his study, **Obmi** has only a studded leather jacket and a long knife (the equivalent of a shortsword, coated with one dose of the poison noted in the assassin statistics). If worst comes to worst, he bolts for room 12B and bars the door once he is inside.

***Treasure.*** **Obmi** uses a plain wooden box as a footstool. It seemingly holds only old clothes of his—but beneath a false bottom, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find, some gems are hidden: two worth 500 gp each, eight worth 100 gp each, twenty-three worth 50 gp each, forty-one worth 10 gp each, and eighteen worth 5 gp each.

### 12B. Obmi's Bedchamber
In a larger chamber adjacent to his study, the renegade dwarf has a soft bed, a small stand, a table and chair, a cabinet, two iron chests, and an arming rack. His *dwarven plate* and *+1 shield* (AC 20, or AC 23 with his shield) are laid on the rack near the door, and his *+1 battleaxe* and *+1 warhammer* (each deals 1d8 + 4 damage in **Obmi**'s hands) hang on the wall above. Underneath the armor are his *gauntlets of ogre power* (giving him an additional +1 to attack and damage rolls with melee weapons). His *ring of invisibility* is on a small stand near his bed.

Upon entering the room **Obmi** will palm the ring, don the armor, put on the gauntlets, thong the axe to his belt, heft the hammer, and grab the shield. At the first good opportunity he will attack the party and raise a cry for help, but he will do so only when he knows help will be able to come. He knows a bit about the drow, and he will bargain with that information, or anything else, to save his life. If offered no quarter, he will fight to the very end.

***Treasure.*** In addition to **Obmi**'s magical gear, both of the iron chests contain valuables. One chest holds 900 gp. The other holds 100 pp and a bejeweled silver ewer and silver bowl (each item worth 500 gp).

### 13. Council Room
The king and his council meet in this large chamber, but the place is now empty. A long table near the center of the room has five great chairs around it. Hides cover parts of the polished black floor. Rude tapestries adorn the walls and are also hung across the openings around the perimeter of the room. There are several torches in the place, but none are lit.

### 13A. West Alcove
Within the alcove to the west is a table with a flat chest on it, locked and full of stones (weighing 200 pounds). If the chest is lifted or moved, a pressure plate underneath it shifts, causing six poisoned arrows to shoot out from the north wall. Each arrow has a range of 100 feet and a +11 bonus to hit; it deals 5 (1d10) piercing damage on a hit, and the target struck must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one). The arrows strike the south wall and shatter if they miss interposing creatures.

The holes for the arrows are sealed with a thin crust of mortar. A character who examines the wall spots them with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Someone who looks carefully at the base of the chest can spot the pressure plate with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The holes can be blocked by hammering iron pitons or similar objects into them. The pressure plate can be wedged in place with the use of at least two such objects. In either case, a character attempting to disarm the trap must succeed on a DC 10 Strength check. On a failed check, the trap operates anyway when the attempt to block it fails.

***Treasure.*** A map of the area around the stronghold hangs on the western wall. Two locked chests rest against the north and south walls—the northern one filled with 850 sp, the southern one holding 500 gp and six bone batons with Dwarvish runes upon them.

Each of the batons is a token of free passage whose runes read, in Giant, "Official Business on Behalf of **King Snurre** the Fearsome." Any individuals or groups that display one of these items are safe from attacks by the giants or the giants' allies as long as they take no aggressive action.

### 13B. South Alcove
Four extra chairs for the council table are stored in the alcove to the south, and a huge cabinet holds eighty-three scrolls and three hundred sixty-seven pieces of paper or parchment.

Most of the cabinet's contents are worthless and of no import, but the sixty-eighth scroll tube contains instructions for **King Snurre**, telling him to gather forces of hill, stone, frost, and fire giants, along with whatever strength he can raise in ogres, oni, cloud giants, and any other creatures for an all-out attack on humankind. The message further promises powerful help from the dark elves. It is signed "Eclavdra."

The papers are copies of messages to and replies from various types of giants and giant-kin. One, in Dwarvish, reads, "The fire giant of stone left and left elbow."

### 14. Door Guard
A **fire giant** stands guard at all times outside the doors to the council chambers.

### 15. Kitchen
Benches, counters, a table, several stools, three cupboards, various bins and barrels, and miscellaneous kitchen gear are scattered around the kitchen. The area to the west is a natural firepit, where flaming gases are used to roast whole creatures.

The place is typically occupied by busy workers: a **fire giant** matron, two fire giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage), and seven **gnolls** thralls. The servants and the gnolls fight only under the direction of the matron, fleeing or surrendering if she falls.

***Slippery Exit.*** The chute to the northwest goes down to the lava pool on the second level (*area 6* on *map 6.6*). Six feet in diameter, it is slippery and greasy from garbage and empties out 2 feet above the lava.

### 16. Storage Chamber
The room near the kitchen is jammed full of barrels of ale and mead, boxes, sacks, hampers, and wheels of cheese. Overhead hang smoked sides of meat, smoked fish, strings of sausages, and the like. There are smaller boxes of salt, and a screw-top copper container filled with spices (wonderfully hot peppers). Tuns of wine and casks of beer are kept handy near the door. The most common item, heaps of hard bread, is everywhere.

### 17. Guest Chamber
The doors to this room are closed on the outside by a great bar, because **King Snurre** does not fully trust his guest, a **rakshasa**, that resides herein. Naturally, most adventurers will assume a creature thus imprisoned might become a trusted associate—an attitude the rakshasa will encourage by taking some benign form (such as that of a fellow adventurer, a kindred soul, who has been deprived of equipment) to gain the characters' confidence before it attacks.

Inside are four beds, a table and two chairs, two stools, and other furnishings including three chests and a footstool (in reality a treasure chest). Rugs and tapestries adorn the floor and walls, and flaming torches in sconces provide light.

***Treasure.*** The rakshasa carries 50 gp and two gems (worth 100 gp each). The disguised chest holds a jeweled scepter worth 1,000 gp, three potions (*superior healing*, *mind reading*, and *invulnerability*), and five *spell scrolls* (*zone of truth*, *true seeing*, *darkness*, *cure wounds* cast at 4th level, and *symbol*).

### 18. Barracks
Currently two **fire giants** and two fire giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) are housed here. They typically lounge around sharpening weapons and telling lies about their amatory prowess.

The room has eight cots, four stools, and four hampers. Each cot is heaped with skins. The hampers contain the giants' personal gear. Pegs on the walls hold their bags and cloaks. There are five clubs, three axes, six spears, and eight shields scattered about, mostly along the north wall. The place is lit by flaming gas jets.

***Treasure.*** One of the clubs, noticeably lighter than the others, has been hollowed out to serve as a treasure cache. It holds 15 pp, 30 gp, 15 ep, 25 sp, 184 cp, and three 100 gp gems.

### 19. Servants' Quarters
This room currently holds four fire giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage). The others that live here are presently at work in the kitchen (*area 15*). This torch-lit chamber has seven cots, various pieces of smaller furniture, and pegs on the walls that hold garments and the like.

***Treasure.*** Each servant has a piece of silver jewelry worth 100 gp.

### 20. Communal Quarters
Three fire giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) care for six young fire giants (use the **ogre** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) in this vast chamber. All have weapons (kids' toys for the youngsters) and will fight with enthusiasm.

There are three beds and six cots along the walls. In each wing is a bench, three chairs, six stools, a long table, and various boxes, hampers, and cupboards.

***Treasure.*** Each servant has a piece of silver jewelry worth 100 gp.

### 21. Entry Hall of the Kennels
Four **hell hounds** scuffle and play just inside the doors. They are part of the pack at area 22 and will flee thereto by the safest route if threatened.

### 22. Kennel Chamber
Four **hell hounds** are here. If those in area 21 are attacked and yelp for assistance, these beasts split into pairs and station themselves in the north and south ends of the open area, from where they spring to the aid of the others. The hell hounds love their handler at area 23 and come to his rescue if he whistles.

The kennel contains no treasure, other than the hounds' prized bones (of interest only to other hell hounds).

### 23. Kennel Keeper's Quarters
Herein dwell **the Keeper** and his mate, two **fire giants** who will rush to the aid of their charges if they hear a commotion outside. Their chamber contains a large bed, a table, two chairs, a bench, a chest, a cabinet, three barrels (beer, mead, and ale), two buckets (his and hers), and a crate (holding dried meat for the hounds). Burning torches light the place. Pegs on the walls hold wearing apparel and the *giants' bags*. A shield, a battleaxe, and a javelin lean against the wall to the north. Hides and pelts decorate the floor and walls, and a number of skins and furs are heaped on the bed and the bench.

***Treasure.*** The second bucket has a false bottom, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. Beneath it are stored 20 pp and eight gems (worth 100 gp each).

The javelin leaning against the wall is actually a *javelin of lightning*.

One of the six cloaks on the bench is a *hell hound cloak* (see *appendix A*). Wrapped inside this cursed cloak is a *sword of vengeance*. There are three other hell hound hides in the chamber (those of beloved departed pets), all quite normal.

### 24. Guardpost
A **fire giant** is on duty here at all times with four throwing rocks nearby. An iron cylinder hanging near the north wall is a gong to be sounded if intruders are seen.

### 25. Barracks
Two **fire giant** warriors and two fire giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage) are lounging among the cots, chests, and other furniture that fill this place. Several pegs here and there hold cloaks, capes, shields, and four *giants' bags*. There are only worthless giant-sized items in the chests and other containers.

One warrior has a greatsword, and the other one fights with a human-sized *+2 greataxe*. The weapon gives the giant a +13 bonus to hit and deals 22 (3d8 + 9) slashing damage. The room also has twenty-one throwing rocks, which all the giants will use if the opportunity presents itself.

***Treasure.*** The easternmost of the three pillars has a secret hatch (equivalent to a secret door) concealing a hollowed-out space that contains 800 gp and three pieces of gem-studded jewelry (worth 500 gp each).

## Second Level: General Features
Map 6.6 shows the layout of the second level of the fire giant stronghold. The floors, walls, and ceilings throughout the area are of black, reddish-black, dark gray, and dull brown rock. In some places the stone has been hewn, but in others it appears to have been fused by heat.

![[021-atg06-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)***Ceilings.*** Passageways have vaulted ceilings 30 feet high. Caves, chambers, and rooms are 40 to 60 feet high.

***Doors.*** All doors are made of iron plates. A Medium or smaller creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to open any of the doors in this place due to their great size and weight. Doors stay open if left that way.

***Illumination.*** Light is provided by torches, braziers, natural gas jets, and molten lava.

***Locks.*** The hall contains numerous well-made locks. Someone using thieves' tools can pick a lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

***Secret Doors.*** Secret doors on this level are precisely crafted. Unless otherwise noted, it requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find such a door.

### Random Encounters
On the second level of the fire giant stronghold, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, roll a d12. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- One **fire giant** and one **fire giant servant** (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage)
- One **troll** escorting one **hill giant**, one **stone giant**, or one **frost giant**
- One **troll** with ten **gnolls**
- One **drow mage** with five **wererats**

## Second Level Locations
The following locations are identified on map 6.6.

### 1. Hall of the Dead
This dark hall contains twenty huge sarcophagi standing upright against the walls, and four even larger ones lying on the floor in the center of the chamber. Those four are made of stone, and the northern two have likeness of fire giants carved into their lids, while the southern two are blank.

Of the sarcophagi that line the walls, half are made of stone, six are crafted from bronze, two are brass, and two are iron. All of them bear likenesses of fire giant kings and queens.

Examination will reveal that each of these burial vaults contains only the remains of a king or a queen, moldering garments, a few corroded weapons, and similar worthless items (wererat grave robbers stole anything of value long ago).

***Secret Exit.*** The tunnel behind the secret door in the southeast corner is about 5 feet in diameter. It twists and turns so that any person using it will lose all sense of direction before exiting at *area 2* on *map 6.7*.

### 2. Ettin Guards' Chamber
Four **ettins** reside here when they are not on duty near the main entrance to the grand hall (*map 6.5*, *area 2*). Two are asleep, their weapons within easy reach, while the other two quite alert. The chamber has a rude table, a bench, two stools, and four cots. Torches light the place. Nine pegs on the walls hold clothing and six *giants' bags*.

***Treasure.*** In the northwest corner is a hamper with six sacks, each holding 600 cp (which is the ettins' accumulated pay).

### 3. Visitors' Chamber
The doors to the north open into a room that houses two **stone giants** who have been working for **King Snurre** as engineers. The room, lit by torches, contains four cots, a large table, other furnishings, and pegs that hold clothing and two *giants' bags*. Eleven throwing rocks are scattered on the floor. A haunch of meat rests on the table along with mugs and platters of tin.

***Treasure.*** Each giant has 250 gp and a gem (worth 100 gp).

### 4. Storage Room
This room, illuminated by four torches set in wall cressets, has been cleaned out to serve as quarters for four **hill giants**. If they survived or escaped the assault on the steading, **Chief Nosnra** and his wife are among the occupants.

If only ordinary hill giants are here, the room contains nothing more than four heaps of skins for bedding, a table, and two chests.

If Nosnra and **Grutha** are present, the place has two cots, two heaps of skins, a trunk, a chain, a table, and two chests.

***Treasure.*** Ordinary hill giants carry 100 gp each but have no other treasure. The chief, if present, will have brought along whatever of his valuables he could salvage and carry here.

### 5. Community Quarters
In this large area are housed a **fire giant** warrior, three fire giant servants (use the **hill giant** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage), and four young fire giants (use the **ogre** statistics, plus immunity to fire damage). All are armed with various weapons, even the young, and there are twenty throwing rocks in the chamber.

The place holds several beds, two large cabinets, two tables, miscellaneous smaller furniture, a crate, and three small boxes. Lit torches are set along on the walls, as well as pegs that hold clothing and four *giants' bags*. Bits of gear, eating utensils, and odds and ends are scattered about the place too.

***Treasure.*** The fire giant warrior has 200 gp in his bag, and the other three adults have 100 gp each hidden in their personal effects.

### 6. Smithy
As the characters approach the natural cavern on the west side of the stronghold, they hear an intermittent hammering sound, made by a metallic object, coming from the other side of the opening. The hall outside this place is tinged a bloody red by the light emitted from the lava pool and the flaming gas jets that are found inside.

A knotty-limbed, burly **fire giant**, **King Snurre**'s weaponsmith, is working here. He uses the molten lava to heat the items he works. With him are two **trolls** that serve as his assistants. Currently in his forge, in various stages of completion, are three giant-sized swords, some pieces of armor, and several axe and spear heads.

***Treasure.*** The weaponsmith has in his possession a special *+2 mace*, made of strange black metal, that he is doing some repair work on. If he is attacked and the fight goes against him, there is a 33 percent chance per round that he uses his action to toss the mace into the lava and destroy it, rather than let it fall into the hands of his enemies.

### 7. Torture Chamber
At the midpoint of the east–west corridor, steps lead down to the south, ending at a cluttered room with a 50-foot-high ceiling (which enables even very tall victims to be suspended on chains well above the floor). The stairway and the chamber are lit by torches, but the area is lightly obscured due to steam and murk.

The gloomy chamber contains a large (giant-sized) rack, a smaller (human-sized) one, an iron maiden (at the location marked A), and a stone-rimmed well (at the location marked B). Various chains, bats, irons, whips, ropes, wires, and the like are strewn about the place. A table, two chairs, a stool, and a large barrel of ale complete the picture.

Two **fire giants**, the King's Torturer and the Royal Headsman, are crouched in the center of the room, playing knucklebones on the floor with stakes of jewelry gems scattered in front of them. The headsman has his gigantic *+2 greataxe* at hand—a weapon that can be employed only by a creature at least as strong and massive as he is. He has a +13 bonus to hit with the weapon, and it deals 28 (3d12 + 9) slashing damage on a hit. His friend the torturer has a greatsword nearby.

If the torturer is engaged in melee, he grapples his opponent and attempts to carry or throw the character into the iron maiden and slam it shut, dealing 55 (10d10) piercing damage to the unlucky victim. A victim can't open the iron maiden from within.

If the headsman is closely pressed, he grapples his opponent and tosses the character headfirst down the well. Anyone flung into the well falls 90 feet into an underground pool of water.

After the torturer uses the iron maiden, he begins tossing as many characters as possible down the well until the room is cleared of opponents. The headsman, by contrast, uses his axe after tossing one victim down the well.

***Treasure.*** The stakes of the game include six pieces of jewelry (worth 250 gp each) and ten gems (worth 50 gp each).

### Cell Complex
A number of small chambers are clustered around the center of this level of the stronghold. These rooms, labeled 1C through 14C, are cells meant to hold prisoners. In addition, the guardroom for the cell complex is marked with a G. Each cell has a thick wooden door with a high, barred window (about 15 feet up, too high for the average human to peek through without some climbing). Inside these rooms are rings set in the walls, chains attached to the rings, buckets, heaps of straw, and precious little else.

The occupants and other contents of the cells and the guardroom are as follows.

***Cell 1C.*** The female elf in this cell is destined for sacrifice in the Temple. She is a **noble**, and she promises that if she is rescued, she will send her rescuers a reward of 1,000 gp, twenty *+1 arrows*, an *arrow of giant slaying*, a *cloak of elvenkind*, and a pair of *boots of elvenkind*. The reward will come to the characters a month or two after she is able to leave the stronghold and return home.

***Cell 2C.*** Eight male elf **commoners** are awaiting sacrifice in the Temple. They have no treasure, but they promise to sing their rescuers' praises.

***Cell 3C.*** A merchant is being held for ransom. He is a human **commoner** whose goods have all been seized by the giants, and thus he can pay his rescuers only with eternal gratitude.

***Cell 4C.*** The cell is empty. On the west wall is a secret door that opens only with a key held by the drow high priestess at *area 12*.

***Cell 5C.*** Two noble **centaurs** imprisoned here are bound for torture and execution. They offer help to any who free them.

***Cell 6C.*** The cell is empty.

***Cell 7C.*** Three **gnolls** being punished for insubordination were thrown in here. One is already dead from the aftereffects of torture; the other two will serve any rescuer who can tolerate their habits.

***Cell 8C.*** The cell is empty.

***Cell 9C.*** In this cell sits a **troll** that is used for torture practice from time to time. It is mindless and enraged, so it will attack instantly if given a chance. Otherwise, it remains motionless.

***Cell 10C.*** Seven **gnolls** caught stealing gold await their fate in this cell. They run away as fast as possible.

***Cell 11C.*** Two human skeletons lie on the floor, twined in each other's arms.

***Cell 12C.*** A female human **assassin** is chained to the wall. She cheerfully admits to being a thief who was caught trying to find the king's treasure room ("Know where it is?") and volunteers to aid the party faithfully in exchange for a chance to escape. Thereafter, if the opportunity presents itself, she will heist as much in gems and magic as she can and then slip away—but until then she will help the characters to the best of her ability (both to better her own chances of staying alive in this awful place and to win their trust). During this time she will be casing the characters to learn what they carry.

***Cell 13C.*** The king's chief lieutenant, a **fire giant** named Boldo, hangs in chains as punishment for failing to be properly deferential to Snurre. He will do anything to get back into Snurre's favor. Thus, he will happily lie to the party and tell them he is here because he tried to prevent Snurre from taking his current hostile course. If freed, he tells the characters, he can get several other fire giants to aid them in overthrowing the king and restoring the peace. In fact, Boldo will betray the party at his earliest opportunity. He is quite bright, and he will not be rash.

***Cell 14C.*** Chained in the cell next to the guardroom is an **empyrean** (of chaotic good alignment). It has been drugged and is effectively unconscious. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check can identify the effects of exposure to a virulent form of oil of taggit (see "*Sample Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). Magic, such as *protection from poison* or *lesser restoration*, can remove the poison from the empyrean's system. Otherwise, he recovers naturally in 12 hours. If awakened, he helps any party destroy the inhabitants of this place, although he would not mind seeing evil characters in the party die also.

***Guardroom (G).*** One **fire giant** guard and three **wererats** in human form (appearing as female humans in tattered clothing) are conversing here by torchlight. The giant has two rocks nearby. In the room are a table, a chair, a stool, a bench, three kegs on the floor, and a small, covered jar on the table. The first keg holds small beer, the second one water, and the third one mead. The jar contains oil of taggit; anyone who opens the jar is exposed to the poison and has disadvantage on the saving throw. On the walls are pegs holding a giant's bag, a cape, a shield, keys to the cells, and a shirt.

If the guard is subdued and interrogated, he knows nothing of the secret tunnel to *area 8* (and thus does not volunteer that information). If the disguised wererats are conversed with, they claim to be captives forced to labor for the giants as scullions. If they are attacked, the wererats assume the form of giant rats and escape through a drain hole in the northwest corner of the room, traveling from there to alert the drow of intruders.

The secret door to the east opens into a passage about 2 feet wide and 1½ feet high. It is rough, and a human in armor could not hope to pass along its length; even a halfling would have to struggle to get through it.

***Treasure.*** A loose stone in the floor to the east of the door hides a cache of 30 ep, 60 gp, and 21 pp. The guard wears a gemmed brooch (worth 100 gp) on his cloak.

### 8. Secret Room
This place, pitch dark, is the lair of seven **wererats**. If the encounter is going badly for them, survivors flee down the northeast passageway to *area 15* on the third level (*map 6.7*) and warn the drow.

Aside from stolen cloaks piled here and there like nests, the chief features in this secret room are three heavy iron chests. All are locked, and each key is on a different wererat. The chests are also trapped with poison needles (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). The poison on these needles is oil of taggit (see "*Sample Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

The third chest the characters investigate is additionally trapped so that two poisoned darts fire upward from the inside when the lid is opened. Each dart has a range of 30 feet and a +8 bonus to hit. It deals 2 (1d4) piercing damage on a hit and subjects its victim to exposure to drow poison (see "*Sample Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). The mechanism for this trap is inside the chest, thus it cannot be detected from the outside. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check while beginning to open the lid notices that it opens stiffly, with resistance from the inside. Those near the chest have a brief moment of warning before the lid springs fully open and the darts shoot forth; anyone who ducks down or lunges away from the chest can avoid being hit.

***Treasure.*** The first chest holds six pieces of jewelry worth 250 gp each, eight pieces worth 500 gp each, and three large pouches stuffed with 100 gp each.

The second chest contains a *potion of poison*, 800 gp (loose), and a cursed *scroll of protection* (lycanthropes). Someone who reads the scroll must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become afflicted with wererat lycanthropy.

The third chest is empty, but a permanent *invisibility* spell covers writing on the inside of the lid. If the invisibility is dispelled, the information tells where a stone in the wall along the stairs down can be removed to reveal a *ring of shooting stars*, a *spell scroll* of seven cleric spells (DM's choice), and a metal case holding six potions (*healing*, *diminution*, plus four more of the DM's choice).

A secret compartment in the lid of the box that contains the potions holds *pipes of the sewers*. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check while examining the box finds the compartment.

### Temple of the Eye (Areas 9–11)
Illusionary walls (represented by dashed lines on the map) screen the temple area from discovery. Making physical contact with these images reveals their illusory nature. Someone who examines either image without touching it can determine that it is an illusion by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. On a successful check, the illusions fade for that character, becoming transparent enough to see through.

Beyond the illusions, the whole place is illuminated by a strange, swirling light that seems to be part of the very air. Eddies of luminosity drift here and there, causing the whole scene to be difficult to perceive. Distances and dimensions are tricky to determine in the shifting light of rusty purple motes and lavender rays. Globs of mauve and violet seem to seep and slide around. The ceiling of the temple is out of visual range, 50 feet high at its lowest point and well over 65 feet where it vaults upward in the center.

#### 9. Giants' Worship Area
Each pillar radiates a sense of unease and insecurity in a 5-foot radius (simulate this by making players uneasy in whatever way you find best). The wall to the west is a mural showing giants bowing before a black cairn, offering sacrifices and giving gifts. The floor in the western half of the area is of porphyry, and the pillars are made of serpentine. Their well-polished surfaces reflect the strange light that permeates the place. The scenes on the west wall grow more gruesome as the viewer proceeds north, culminating in scenes showing human and giant sacrifice near the end closest to the altar (*area 11*).

#### 10. Servants' and Thralls' Worship Area
The polished floor of red and black hornblende seems to flow between the thin pillars of obsidian that border this area. Each of these pillars radiates an aura of mild fear in a 2-foot radius, and if one is touched the creature who comes into contact with it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if by a *fear* spell with the pillar as the object of its fear. Passing between two pillars causes a creature to take 5 (2d4) lightning damage, or double that if it is wearing metal armor.

The wall to the east shows a scene of various creatures submitting to a trio of huge, vaguely squid-like creatures, each with ten hairy tentacles and mottled in various shades and tints of purple and violet. In the forefront of this mass self-sacrifice are elves and humans, but there are also dwarves, gnolls, orcs, trolls, halflings, ogres, goblins, and other creatures among the crowd. Those near the front of the line are being torn apart and the bloody gobbets eaten as dainty morsels.

#### 11. Priests' Area
The northern end of the temple is tiered, with three low steps that lead up toward the center of the north wall. This wall, made of cloudy purple stone, displays an inlay of a huge inverted triangle with a Y shape enclosed in it and touching the triangle's sides. Hanging beneath this symbol, suspended on chains from the ceiling, is a black metal triangle and cylinder.

The floor of the first tier is black stone shot through with veins of violet. A great drum of blackened skin and chitinous material rests on the western side of the first tier. On the eastern side is a rack from which hang nine silver cylinders, apparently a set of chimes. (these chime tubes are hollow and are worth 100 gp each).

The large pillar to the east on the first tier is made of malachite and is covered with graven signs and sigils. A casting of *detect magic* reveals that the glyphs radiate an aura of conjuration magic. If the correct pair of gylphs are touched, the creature touching them will be transported to *area 18* on the third level (see *map 6.7*). You should devise the twenty-four glyphs upon this pillar and select which two are the trigger mechanism.

The second tier is dark gray stone, with specks of lilac and orange and purple. It holds a huge stone altar block of dull, porous-looking, somewhat rust-colored black mineral. To either side of the altar are large bronze braziers whose corroded green coloration is particularly nauseating in this setting. Flanking the braziers, in the form of triangles pointing downward, are two sets of candelabra, each candelabrum having three branches. These are made of bronze that is green with age, and each branch holds a fat black candle that burns with a flame of leaping lavender and deep glowing purple but never grows shorter.

The third tier is dull black stone with whorls of plum and lavender and splotches of red. The metal triangle stands upon the third tier. If the altar stone is touched by living flesh or hit by a weapon (or any object), it begins to fade in color, and in 3 rounds becomes a translucent amethyst color with a black, amorphous center. A creature that touches or strikes the altar when it is in this form must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 hour.

If the drum on the first tier is beaten, the chimes are rung, and the triangle is struck while the altar is in this translucent state, a glowing golden eye swims into view in the stone's writhing center. For each creature that sees the eye, roll a d12 and consult the following table. The creature is affected as if by a *symbol* spell of the indicated type (save DC 15):

| d12 | Result |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Death |
| 2 | Discord |
| 3 | Fear |
| 4 | Hopelessness |
| 5 | Insanity |
| 6–12 | No effect (looked away in time) |

Except for the death effect, these effects are curses and can be removed only as such.

If the three *tentacle rods* from *area 12* are in the characters' possession when the eye appears, and the braziers remain lit, then the altar becomes a means of summoning an Elder Elemental God—it turns a transparent heliotrope in color, the black mass at the center grows larger and shows swollen veins of purple, and the eye is a fiery red-orange. Then a tentacle comes out of the altar and grabs the nearest living creature. The tentacle has a reach of 20 feet and a +11 bonus to hit. A creature hit by the tentacle is drawn into the stone—totally gone, destroyed.

If a creature is drawn into the altar, the altar returns to its dormant state, and atop it will be the thing most wished for by the party—or something that will enable the characters to attain the end or state they most desire.

If a second summoning of this Elder Elemental God is attempted within the same day, roll a d12 and apply the indicated result from the table below.

| d12 | Result |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Tentacles try to seize and devour 1d4 more creatures within the minute, but entity does not grant any additional desires. |
| 2 | Entity strikes everyone present permanently blind and does not grant any additional desires. |
| 3 | Entity raises one ability score of each character present by 1 point and takes no sacrifice. |
| 4–12 | Entity ignores the whole thing. |

***Treasure.*** The only items of value in the temple that can be salvaged are the silver chimes. Each hollow silver cylinder is worth 100 gp.

### 12. Drow Clerics' Area
![[016-totyp-06-18.webp|right|300]]

The entrance to this chamber is protected by a wall of tentacles (not depicted on the map). It appears as rough brown-purple stone. This magic wall is like two **ropers** combined into one creature, giving it two bite attacks and eight tendrils that it can employ every round (though the tendrils have a range of only 20 feet). The wall has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. A casting of *dispel magic* deals the wall 50 damage, and *disintegrate* deals it 100 damage.

Drow can freely pass through the wall. If any other creature touches it, the wall attacks and emits a hissing and champing noise to alert the occupants of the chamber beyond it. If its current hit points drop to half its hit point maximum or lower, the wall casts *darkness* on itself (affecting only the outside of the wall, not its inner surface).

The chamber south of the wall is lit by the same everburning black candles that are found in the temple (*area 11*), so the illumination is eerie and dim. The walls are hung with purple cloth, and the floor is thickly carpeted in black. The inner room to the east is screened off from the outer room by a brocaded hanging of black with orange, gold, lilac, and mauve.

#### Outer Chamber
The antechamber is the quarters of a **drow elite warrior** and a **drow mage** who assist their priestess, Eclavdra. Each has a *tentacle rod* in addition to its usual gear and weaponry.

A smoldering copper brazier near the door gives off an incense-like smoke that is sweet, cloying, decayed-smelling, disgusting, alluring, and euphoric all at once. In the candlelit room are two low black couches, each inlaid with silver. To one side sit a round table and two armchairs. At the foot of each couch is a low table with a basin and ewer made of jasper. Small stools and enameled coffers provide a bit of decoration.

***Treasure.*** The jasper basins and ewers are worth 300 gp per set. The first coffer examined holds a *spell scroll* of *word of recall* and three bars of adamantine, each weighing 5 pounds and worth 500 gp each. The second coffer contains 100 cp, 100 sp, 10 ep, 20 gp, and 10 pp, each type of coin in its own black leather pouch, as well as a pouch of ten gems (worth 50 gp each).

#### Inner Chamber
The inner room, lavishly furnished and decorated, is the sanctuary of Eclavdra, the **drow priestess of Lolth** who has fomented all the trouble with the giants. Like her assistants, she also carries a *tentacle rod* in addition to her other equipment.

![[017-totyp-06-19.webp|right|300]]

Here the light from candles is supplemented by two small braziers of black and silver. Tapestries of a suggestive nature adorn the walls. The furnishings include a large bed, two small tables, three coffers, a buffet, a cabinet, a large wardrobe, two divans with a low chest between them, a dressing table and chair, a large mirror, two hampers, and two chests. All furnishings are of ebony or black stone, and most have silver inlay. The wardrobe holds feminine clothing and the priestess's vestments of mauve, black, and plum, stitched with gold.

A small screen of ebony inlaid with amber (weighing 10 pounds and worth 150 gp) sets off a dressing area in the southeast corner near the wardrobe, where a low-backed chair stands with a gown thrown over it. This screen effectively hides the location of the secret door, which enables the priestess to slip in and out unseen.

***Treasure.*** Many of the items in Eclavdra's chamber are of significant value.

The priestess's ceremonial garment is set with ten violet garnets (worth 50 gp each), ten topazes (50 gp each), ten black opals (100 gp each), and ten amethysts (100 gp each); it is covered with a plain black wrapper to protect it from dust and damage.

A coffer on the low chest between the divans has a *glyph of warding* on the inside of the lid, so if anyone other than Eclavdra opens it, the glyph casts *insect plague* (spell save DC 14). The container holds three *spell scrolls* (*gate*, *divine word*, and *greater restoration*).

A coffer near her bed contains six potions: *poison*, *mind control (fire giant)* (see*appendix A*), *growth*, *heroism*, and two *philters of love*.

On the dressing table are two combs, a brush, four pins, and ten jars that hold unguents and cosmetics. These items are of onyx and silver, set with tiny gems. Each is worth 50 gp.

Beside her bed on a small table are a basin, a ewer, and a goblet made from lapis lazuli (each is worth 500 gp). The ebony-and-amber screen around the dressing area weighs 10 pounds and is worth 150 gp. The large mirror of silver is worth 50 gp.

### 13. Guest Chamber
If **Jarl Grugnur** and his lady, **Estia**, survived the assault on the glacial rift, they will be sequestered in this chamber, accompanied by a **frost giant** that serves as a door guard. If the jarl and his lady are not present, the room contains two **frost giants**, recently arrived messengers.

The place is dimly lit by a few torches. It holds eight cots, a long table, two benches, two chairs, three stools, two buckets, six chests, a large box, and a cabinet. Hides on the floors and pelts on the cots help to make this place more comfortable and familiar for frost giant guests. Pegs hold clothing and three *giants' bags*.

***Treasure.*** Each giant carries 100 gp. In addition, the jarl and his lady will have whatever loot they managed to salvage from their stronghold.

### 14. Guest Chamber
Two **cloud giants**, a noble and his traveling companion, have come to hear from **King Snurre** why his warfare will profit them and make them more powerful. The giants have two **lions** serving as watch-animals at the door. The noble has a chain mail coat (AC 16), and both have their great morningstars and throwing rocks nearby.

The chamber contains two very large beds, two wardrobes, two small tables, a large table, two chairs, two stools, two buckets, a cabinet, a bench, and four chests. The place is illuminated by torchlight, and there are tapestries on the walls, rugs and hides on the floor, and furs on the beds.

***Treasure.*** On the small table near the bed to the south is a platinum box set with moonstones and sunstones (worth 1,000 gp) that holds ten gems (worth 100 gp each), which are a present to the visitors from the king.

### 15. Trolls' Chamber
Six **troll** guards nest in this room. Two of them keep watch in the northern passage (within the area marked by Xs) and two others do the same in the southern passage. The other two monsters are in the central chamber. Dozens of various polearms, morningstars, and swords lie heaped in the middle of the room. (These are used to arm the gnolls currently penned in areas 16 and 17.)

***Treasure.*** Each troll has a nest of sticks, bones, hide and skin scraps, and other nauseating material in which is hidden 50 gp.

### 16. Thrall Pen
Sixteen unarmed **gnolls** dwell here. Each has nothing but a heap of straw and a hide coverlet. Although these creatures are slaves of the giants, they identify with their masters' cause and will never help humans for any reason—in fact, they will gladly take up arms to fight intruders if given the chance.

### 17. Thrall Pen
Ten unarmed **gnolls** dwell here. They will behave in all respects like their kin in area 16.

## Third Level: General Features
Map 6.7 shows the layout of the lowest level of the fire giant stronghold. This place is entirely natural, the tunnels and caverns showing no marks of being hollowed out, except for the entranceway to the level from above and around the exit beyond the River of Lava.

![[025-atg07-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)As is usual with natural areas, do not worry overmuch about describing direction of passages and walls of caves and caverns, let alone size and shape. Primitive mapping techniques under stress conditions would develop just about the same sort of chart as your players will when their characters explore this level... wretched, but sufficient to get from place to place. If they have made it this far, they do not need any help from the DM!

***Ceilings.*** All passages are at least 20 feet high, small caves being 25 feet or so from floor to ceiling vault and large caverns anywhere from 25 to 75 feet high (areas 7, 19, and 20 are among the highest).

***Illumination.*** Most areas here are dark and still; only a few are lit, such as the lava cavern (*areas 19* and *20*) and the giants' final refuge in a crisis (*area 5*). If you like, add a few patches of phosphorescent growth as dungeon dressing—the light making it possible to see movement across it but not sufficient to illuminate an area.

***Sounds.*** If the characters were to remain still, they might hear water dripping, and perhaps once and once only a far distant echoing of stone striking stone.

### Random Encounters
On the third level of the fire giant stronghold, the chance of a random encounter occurs on an hourly basis. At the end of each hour, roll a d12. On a roll of 1, which indicates a random encounter, choose from the following possibilities:

- Two wandering **trolls**
- A **fire giant** patrolling with two **hell hounds**
- One **drow elite warrior** and three **drow** that use stealth to remain undetected and avoid confrontation

## Third Level Locations
The following locations are identified on map 6.7.

### 1. Cavern
This cavern is fairly colorful, having many reddish, pale yellow, and shining blue-gray rock formations that glisten in the light of torches or lanterns. Three **ropers** dwell here and conceal themselves among the natural stalagmite formations. They wait until prey approaches the center of the area before attacking.

***Treasure.*** Each roper has one gem (worth 100 gp) in its internal digestive organ.

### 2. Glowing Cave
This small offshoot of the larger cavern that runs north and south is filled with luminous plant growth and contains twelve hungry **giant fire beetles**. Some will be on the ceiling and drop upon any creatures entering their lair. These creatures served as a source of gifts for the frost giants in the past. They have no treasure.

### 3. Cavern End
The long cavern hooks eastward and terminates. Near the dead-end wall is an abandoned subterranean lizard's nest that contains several dozen shiny rocks (but none of value).

### 4. Cave
Four **hell hounds** are on guard here, immediately giving voice if they detect any intruders.

### 5. Cavern
Two **fire giants** are stationed here as a reserve on Snurre's order (acting on instructions from the drow, of course). One rests in the northeast end while the other keeps watch, patrolling between the spots marked G. Each has several rocks nearby for throwing. They have a typical giant's bag apiece, and the room also has piles of hides for bedding, a hamper or two, and some personal gear.

In a crisis situation, this is where **King Snurre**, Queen Frupy, **Obmi**, and other important fire giants and guests will retreat to, along with whatever valuables they can salvage.

### 6. Great Vaulted Cavern
In the middle of this place is a permanent illusion of a huge red dragon dozing atop a mound of treasure (appearing like area 7, below). What is actually in that spot is a **gorgon** that obeys drow and has been instructed to ignore the presence of such creatures as hell hounds and fire giants and trolls. If any other kind of creature speaks to it from a distance in Common or Draconic, it has been instructed to stand quietly but then to breathe upon intruders as soon as they are within range. The illusion disappears once the gorgon attacks.

### 7. Treasure Trove Cave
This room is actually an extradimensional space, ten times larger than shown on the map. Anyone entering will notice first the enormous pile of treasure that fills the central part of the area and second the **adult red dragon** sleeping upon it.

Brazzemal is the dragon's name. If the boulder across the entrance is moved, requiring the strength of a fire giant, he will certainly awaken. He will not immediately reveal that he is aware of intruders, preferring to wait until they are at the edge of his breath weapon's range before addressing them.

Brazzemal is persuasive and deceitful, and his real desire will be to slay and devour the party and take their treasures to add to his already considerable hoard. Few adventurers ever face a dragon of his size in battle and live to tell about it; make sure that players and characters are well aware that they face a truly terrifying foe. Characters who are suitably flattering and ransom themselves by handing over the bulk of their wealth and magic items may be allowed to withdraw.

If the dragon is cornered and in desperate straits, he will swear to anything in order to save his life, but his information is not to be trusted (although he will word things in such a way as to avoid uttering any magically detectable lie).

***Treasure.*** Brazzemal's hoard is an enormous heap, most of its volume consisting of loose coins. All the best treasures are buried, and a thorough search through the pile will take a very long time. It contains:

- 69,830 cp
- 34,600 sp
- 1,870 ep
- 9,240 gp
- 200 pp in a malachite box that is itself worth 100 gp
- Twenty-three loose gems worth 10 gp each
- Five gems worth 100 gp each in a gold-chased silver egg (the two halves unscrew) that is itself worth 100 gp
- Twelve pieces of assorted jewelry worth 100 gp each
- Five jeweled weapons, human-sized, worth 200 gp each
- Two silver mirrors worth 50 gp each)
- A ten-piece gold service worth 150 gp per piece
- Ten ivory statues with inlays of gems and precious metals worth 200 gp each
- Four jade carvings and figurines worth 500 gp each inside a small chest
- An idol carved of bloodstone worth 200 gp
- Seven *spell scrolls* of wizard spells (DM's choice) in a crystal casket worth 500 gp
- A *dragon slayer* (DM's choice of sword type) in a jeweled scabbard worth 500 gp
- A *brazier of commanding fire elementals*
- Four *potions of fire resistance (fire)* in a coffer
- Eight jars of rare unguents and perfumes worth 100 gp each
- A suit of *+2 armor*, sized for a human (DM's choice of armor type)

In addition, Brazzemal has six hundred sixty-six gems (worth 1 gp each) pressed into his stomach to protect it. Destructive magical attacks against the dragon will certainly destroy from 60 percent to 90 percent of these gems as well as wreaking havoc with the hoard as a whole.

### 8. Cave
This is a drow guardroom, currently housing three **drow elite warriors** and six **drow**. All are clothed in black capes, shod with soft boots of black hide, and wear hoods over their helmets. Two sentries are on duty at all times near the entrance. The room holds only bedrolls and some miscellaneous gear.

***Treasure.*** Each elite warrior carries 40 pp, and each other drow carries 5 pp.

### 9. Wide Passage
Twelve **piercers** make their home in a cul de sac, where they patiently await unwary prey. The floor of the place is strewn with shattered skulls and bones.

***Treasure.*** Amid the gleaming white remains lies a gold necklace set with five gems (worth 250 gp in total).

### 10. Singing Chamber
This small place has excellent acoustics, and the drops of water falling into the pool along the southern portion of the wall make a faint, pleasant musical sound that can be heard for 120 feet in silence (or from 60 feet away in normal conditions). The pool's edge is lined by a huge patch of **gray ooze**, and another lies along a ledge 11 feet high in the southeast of the place.

### Stinking Caverns (Areas 11-13)
The large spaces along the southern side of this level are inhabited by troll servants of **King Snurre**. The stink that comes from these creatures, their nests, and the offal and remnants of rotted meat they leave about is noticeable from as far away as the head of the corridor that leads southwest from near *area 9*.

These caverns are very dangerous. If the trolls hear suspicious noises, or if any of them are assaulted, they split up to use the multiple passages in these areas to surprise and surround their attackers, leaping out of the darkness to tear them to shreds. An assault from nine trolls is nothing to sneeze at, even for a high-level party.

***Treasure.*** Each troll's nest holds about 1,000 gp worth of mixed coins. The nest of the large troll in *area 13* also contains fifteen gems worth 100 gp each and a jeweled mace worth 500 gp.

#### 11. Troll Annex
Three **trolls** lounge herein, each with the typical messy mound of sticks and bones and other noisome things.

#### 12. Troll Central
Two **trolls**. This room, and its inhabitants, are much the same as those in area 11.

#### 13. Troll Heaven
Four **trolls**, including a dominant one that is particularly large (120 hit points), reside here. Conditions are similar to those in areas 11 and 12, except even more noisome.

### 14. Narrow Cavern
The corridor leading north from the troll dens is striated with layers of blue and green and greenish-blue deposits and streaks. Patches of green slime (see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) grow on the roof of the passage and in the pool of water at its end. The slime on the ceiling covers an area about 40 feet wide just south of the pool. The pool holds thirty-six agates (worth 10 gp each), which sparkle in the presence of any light-source. Any creature that reaches in to get these stones is 50 percent likely to blunder into the slime in the pool, which blends in with the greenish rock.

### 15. Gray Cavern
This dark-walled place is the drow strong point, and a **drow** watches each of the six routes that meet at this cavern. Four more drow are stationed in the chamber itself, for a total of ten.

In addition, the eastern alcove serves as a field headquarters for two **drow elite warriors** (the female is in command) and a **drow mage**. Near this alcove, a narrow passage leads east and then south, ending at a set of rough-hewn stairs that ascend to the second level, emerging near *area 8* on *map 6.6*.

***Treasure.*** The warriors and the mage carry 40 pp apiece, and each drow has 5 pp.

### 16. Small Cavern
The arrows to the north of the entry passage on the map mark the location of a trap. A character must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a tripwire made of fine spidersilk that is stretched across the entrance of the cavern. If an intruder steps on the wire, the act triggers a torrent of small iron spheres, each ¼ inch in diameter, that pour out of hidden containers on the eastern wall. These little spheres coat the floor in the final 40 feet of the passageway and the first 20 feet of the cavern itself.

If they fall, the iron balls make a loud noise, and any creature moving across the affected area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that moves through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.

There are nine female drow in the place. Five are normal **drow**, and three others are **drow elite warriors**. These eight guards protect **Nedylene**, a **drow priestess of Lolth** who is opposed to anything Eclavdra attempts. She is here to check up on her rival, and she will be suspicious of any creature entering her current abode. On the other hand, she will not be averse to seeing her rival's plans go wrong, so negotiation is a possibility.

**Nedylene** wields a *+2 whip* and carries a *staff of swarming insects* in addition to her other gear.

### 17. Jeweled Cavern
If light strikes the walls of this cavern, mineral deposits make the place glitter and sparkle as if it were sown with jewels. This breathtakingly beautiful place is the current lair of two **mind flayers** who have decided to see what is going on with their friendly enemies, the drow. They plan to observe events, and the dark elves ignore them.

***Treasure.*** Each mind flayer carries 250 gp (bribe money), and they have a *tome of clear thought* in a black metal box that can be opened only by a creature that has Intelligence 18 or higher.

### 18. Small Cavern
The cave at the end of the passage to the northeast is another drow guardroom, with occupants and contents identical to *area 8*: three **drow elite warriors** and six **drow**, two of which are on duty at all times near the entrance.

***Treasure.*** Each elite warrior carries 40 pp, and each other drow carries 5 pp.

### 19. Salamander Central
The huge cavern in the northwest corner of this level is lit up in reddish light from the bubbling, steaming river of molten lava that flows through the place. The cavern stinks of sulfur and heated rock, and the temperature here is very hot, although a strong draft cools it somewhat. The roof is no less than 60 feet high.

A rope bridge is suspended about 15 feet above the lava river, offering safe access to the northern chamber (area 20). The ropes have been specially treated to keep them from bursting into flame. A creature that comes within 10 feet of the lava for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn within 10 feet of the lava, takes 11 (2d10) fire damage. A creature that enters or touches the lava for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn in the lava, takes 33 (6d10) fire damage.

Amid this vaporous inferno in the area to the southeast are two **salamanders** enjoying a change of clime. The flames and smoke render the area lightly obscured. The salamanders are totally indifferent with respect to whom they attack, although they know and respect the drow.

### 20. Council Chamber and Drow HQ
The secluded section of the cavern to the north serves as the meeting place and council chamber for Eclavdra and her minions. If things have gone badly for the drow and Eclavdra has escaped, she will be here with any surviving followers.

A constant watch is kept on the east entry to the cavern—if intruders come, the dark elves will know of it. If threatened by powerful characters, the drow will cut the rope bridge, then flee to safety back along the passage to the north-northwest (at the location marked A), descending deep into the Underdark.

Currently in this place (at the least) are six **drow** and four **drow elite warriors**, one of which is a female commander who has 110 hit points. The commander has a *+2 shortsword*, a *+1 hand crossbow*, and three magic bolts, as follows:

- A *bolt of holding*, which casts *hold person* on a target hit with the bolt, as well as up to two other targets within 30 feet of that target
- A *bolt of blinding*, which casts *blindness/deafness* to blind on a target hit with the bolt, as well as up to two other targets within 30 feet of that target
- A *bolt of vapors*, which casts *stinking cloud* centered on the point it hits

Each of these effects has a spell save DC of 15 and a duration of 1 minute.

***Treasure.*** In addition to bedding and a small amount of personal gear, a chest holding 200 pp and ten gems worth 100 gp each is hidden behind a rock formation in the far northeastern corner of the place. (Anyone who looks there will find the chest.)

The commander has a small coffer that contains two *potions of speed* and two *potions of superior healing*. These will be used by the drow if necessary (and if she is able to dispense them).

### Pursuing the Drow
A pair of hoists—derrick-like machines with straps strong enough to hold cargo of any sort (even giants!)—are tucked into nooks on either side of the river of lava. If any of the dark elves escape and the characters want to follow them, they can use these hoists to transport their possessions over the lava. It will take several hours to set the devices into working position, but thereafter characters will be able to move supplies and pack animals across the river and begin their pursuit of the drow.

If the characters choose not to chase the dark elves, assume that the drow collapse the tunnel behind them, sealing off the Underdark and ending the threat of coordinated giant attacks thereafter. In any case, surviving characters are to be congratulated on the success of their mission.
