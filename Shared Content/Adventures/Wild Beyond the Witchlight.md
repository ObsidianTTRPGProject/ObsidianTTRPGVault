# Into the Feywild
This Dungeons & Dragons adventure begins in a world of your choosing—perhaps a world of your own creation—then ventures into the Feywild. Also known as the Plane of Faerie, the Feywild is a place of wonder and whimsy ruled by unfettered emotion. Before running this adventure, please read the "*Feywild*" section in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, as it contains useful information about this dusky, fantastic plane of existence.

The information in this book is intended for the DM's eyes only. If you're planning to play through the adventure with someone else as your DM, stop reading now!

## Adventure Summary
The main antagonists of this story are three hags who collectively form the Hourglass Coven, which is described in appendix B. These hags are the adoptive sisters of Iggwilv, a powerful figure from D&D's past and a key player in the adventure's unfolding drama. Using an artifact called *Iggwilv's Cauldron*, the hags have trapped an archfey named Zybilna in temporal stasis and carved up her fey domain among them. This domain is called Prismeer. To enter it, the characters must first visit the Witchlight Carnival, which travels across the Material Plane and appears on the characters' world once every eight years. The carnival owners are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**, who can help or hinder the characters' efforts to reach Prismeer.

One of the many novelties of this adventure is that the characters can accomplish their goals without resorting to violence—but only if they're clever. They can fight their way through the adventure as well, but the odds won't always be in their favor.

### Adventure Structure
The characters are drawn into the adventure by one of two adventure hooks. You choose which hook to use. Both hooks are described in "Beginning the Adventure," later in this introduction.

*Chapter 1* describes the Witchlight Carnival. Hidden somewhere in the carnival is a fey crossing to the domain of Prismeer, but the trick to opening this portal is known only to the carnival's shadar-kai owners, **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**.

*Chapters 2*, *3*, and *4* describe the carved-up domain of Prismeer, which the hags of the Hourglass Coven have usurped and split into thirds. The characters can move between these splinter-realms only if they have the right fey guides to help them.

*Chapter 5* describes the Palace of Heart's Desire, where the archfey Zybilna and her court are frozen in time by the magic of *Iggwilv's Cauldron*. The palace is where the characters need to go if they hope to thwart the Hourglass Coven by freeing Zybilna or destroying the cauldron.

The book concludes with several appendices wherein you'll find rules for new magic items, stat blocks for new creatures, and other goodies. At the end of the book is a *Story Tracker* you can use to keep track of story developments as they occur. Advice on how to use the Story Tracker appears later in this introduction.

### Character Advancement
The adventure assumes that the characters start at 1st level. If your players are more interested in exploration and social interaction than combat, or if you want to make the characters' Feywild excursion less dangerous, have them start at 3rd level instead. Advancement is handled the same way regardless.

In this adventure, the characters receive experience points for achieving milestones rather than defeating monsters:

- **Entering a Hag's Realm** Whenever the characters enter a hag's realm (Hither, Thither, or Yon) for the first time, everyone in the party receives enough XP to advance 1 level. For example, when the characters leave the Witchlight Carnival and arrive in Hither for the first time, they gain a level.
- **Encountering a Hag** After the characters encounter a hag of the Hourglass Coven for the first time, everyone in the party who survives the encounter receives enough XP to advance 1 level.
- **Freeing Zybilna** If the characters free Zybilna from temporal stasis or destroy *Iggwilv's Cauldron*, everyone in the party receives enough XP to advance 1 level.

If you follow this method of character advancement, characters who start the adventure at 1st level might reach 8th level by the adventure's conclusion.

## Running the Adventure
To run the adventure, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks (*Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*).

>>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
>>

The *Monster Manual* contains stat blocks for most of the creatures encountered in this adventure. When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, "Hey, DM, you'd better get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it." If the stat block is not from the *Monster Manual*, the adventure's text tells you where to find it.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* unless the adventure's text directs you to *appendix A*.

### Using the Maps
This book contains a fold-out, double-sided poster map and several interior maps. These elements are further described in the sections that follow.

#### Poster Map
The adventure lets you know when it's safe to show your players either side of the double-sided poster map.

One side of the poster map shows the Witchlight Carnival and a Time Tracker, to help you track the passage of time as the characters explore the carnival. Certain carnival events occur only when the Time Tracker reaches a certain point. Though it's not necessary, your group can place tokens or miniatures on the map to keep track of where the characters are in the carnival at any given time.

The reverse side of the poster map shows the Feywild domain of Prismeer, now divided into three splinter-realms called Hither, Thither, and Yon. Lodged between them is the Palace of Heart's Desire—the home of Prismeer's archfey ruler, Zybilna. This side of the map is meant to be shared with the players once the characters reach the palace, from where they can look out over the whole domain. DM-friendly versions of this map appear in *chapters 2*, *3*, and *4*, to help you track the party's progress through Prismeer's splinter-realms.

> ##### Eight and Three
>As you run *The Wild Beyond the Witchlight*, look for ways to bring the numbers eight and three to the fore. For example, characters who take a long rest in the fey domain of Prismeer might, without fail, be awakened by three songbirds at the end of the eighth hour.
>
>The number eight is symbolically important, as this adventure plays with the themes of time and nostalgia. The numeral 8 resembles an hourglass, which measures the passage of time, and looks like the symbol for infinity (∞) turned on its side. Hidden within the numeral 8 itself is the numeral 3. In the D&D multiverse, there exists the Rule of Three, which states that events of cosmic consequence often manifest in threes. Time, for instance, has a past, present, and future. The Hourglass Coven has three members. The fey domain of Prismeer is divided into three splinter-realms, which adventurers explore with the help of three guides.
>
>Hidden within the adventure are numerous other mentions of the numbers eight and three. Can you find them all?
>

#### Interior Maps
Maps that appear in this book are for your eyes only. As the characters explore locations on a given map, you can redraw portions of the map on graph paper, a wet-erase mat, or another surface to help your players visualize locations that might have unusual shapes or features. Your hand-drawn maps need not be faithful to the originals, and you can alter a map's features as you see fit. Nor do your maps need to be painstakingly rendered. You can omit details that are not readily visible (such as secret doors and other hidden features) until the characters are able to detect and interact with them.

***Slopes and Staircases.*** An arrow on a slope or staircase always points in the ascending direction.

#### Landmarks Not to Scale
The poster map of Prismeer and the interior maps of Hither, Thither, and Yon show important landmarks that are described in the text. These landmarks are not drawn to scale.

### Using the Story Tracker
This adventure uses a *Story Tracker*, a copy of which is included at the back of this book. The Story Tracker is a note-keeping tool to help you remember important information about the characters and their accomplishments.

![[000-00-001.unicorn-horn.png|right|300]]

At various times in the adventure, you will be advised to jot down information on the Story Tracker, as events that happen in earlier chapters can give characters an advantage in later chapters. The Story Tracker also allows you to record important details. For example, if a character falls under a curse, noting the specifics of the curse on the Story Tracker might remind you of the effect.

#### Unicorn Horn
A lost unicorn horn plays an important part in the adventure. Its location is determined randomly by rolling on the Unicorn Horn's Location table. Once you determine where the horn is, record its location on the *Story Tracker*.

The horn belongs to a unicorn named Elidon, who was captured and transformed into a rocking horse by the Hourglass Coven. For more information about Elidon, see area L6 in *chapter 3*.

##### Unicorn Horn's Location
| d8 | Location |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Offered for sale at Trinket, Bauble, and Charm's in Downfall (see *area D10* in *chapter 2*) |
| 2 | Hidden among the coals under Bavlorna's cauldron (see *area D18* in *chapter 2*) |
| 3 | Stolen by Will of the Feywild and kept in Little Oak (see "Encounters in Thither" in *chapter 3*) |
| 4 | Hidden in one of the cupboards of Loomlurch (see area L10 in *chapter 3*) |
| 5 | In the possession of Archillus the peryton (see "Fey Beacons" in *chapter 4*) |
| 6 | In the possession of **Skylla** the warlock (see area M11 in *chapter 4*) |
| 7 | In the possession of Shon the librarian (see area P28 in *chapter 5*) |
| 8 | Tucked in a wooden chest by Iggrik the quasit (see area P51 in *chapter 5*) |

### Tips for New Dungeon Masters
Most of this book is for the DM's eyes only, since it's full of secrets that your players won't discover until you run the adventure for them. That said, the adventure contains a lot of information that can be shared with the players at specific times, as discussed below.

#### New Character Options
During character creation, you can allow your players to read the new backgrounds and race options that appear in this introduction, if you're comfortable with allowing these options in your game.

#### Magic Item Descriptions
When the characters acquire a new magic item and figure out what it does (see "*Identifying a Magic Item*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*), give that item's description to the players.

#### Statistics
Creature stat blocks should be kept hidden from the players until circumstances warrant otherwise, as discussed below.

***Armor Class.*** When characters make attacks against a creature, you compare those attacks to the creature's Armor Class to determine whether the attacks hit. After a certain number of hits and misses, players can usually pinpoint a creature's AC on their own. However, in the interest of speeding up combat, you can divulge a creature's AC once the characters have hit the creature at least once, allowing players to know without asking if attacks made against the creature hit or miss.

***Hit Points.*** It's better not to tell players how many hit points a creature has. However, you can give the players a sense of how well they're doing against the creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded or on the ropes. Such information gives the players a sense of accomplishment and might spur them to press the attack. On the other hand, if the characters aren't putting much of a dent in the creature's hit points, either because it has a lot of them or it has a trait such as Regeneration, it's a good idea to let the players know that the creature looks like it can take a lot more punishment. That information alone might encourage the players to consider a change of plan, such as a tactical retreat.

***Damage.*** Players need you to tell them how much damage their characters take and what type of damage it is. Whenever the adventure presents damage that is variable, it shows the average damage first, followed by a die expression in parentheses, like this: 10 (3d6). You decide whether to use the average or roll the dice. Using average damage speeds up play, but it might feel less exciting, and players can take advantage of its predictability. Rolling the dice takes more time but can yield more volatile results. In the interest of fairness, commit to one approach or the other for the duration of an encounter or game session.

***Abilities, Strengths, and Weaknesses.*** As their characters fight a creature, players expect to learn more about the creature's strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. It's okay to share such information with them as it becomes apparent. For example, you can describe a creature's wounds closing up when it regenerates.

Characters don't need to fight a creature to know certain facts about it. For example, a character who has the Witchlight hand background and chose a sprite for a carnival companion would know a lot about sprites, including their ability to turn invisible. Similarly, if a character intuits that a **treant**, being a creature made of wood, has vulnerability to fire damage, just smile faintly and say, "That's a reasonable hypothesis." If the treant takes double damage from a *fireball* spell, be sure to let players know how badly the fire hurt it.

Don't be afraid to dole out information to characters who have the applicable knowledge. If you're not sure whether the characters possess such knowledge, have them make an Intelligence check (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more guidance about *ability checks*), and share the information if one or more characters succeed on the check.

#### Dice Rolls
Many DMs like to roll their dice in the open, for all the players to see, to maintain transparency. Other DMs prefer to roll dice behind a screen to maintain suspense. Either approach is fine.

Even DMs who conceal their dice rolls might divulge certain results. For example, when a creature scores a critical hit against a character, it's customary to let the player know that their character just took a particularly nasty hit before revealing how much damage was dealt.

It's okay to ask one of your players to make a die roll for you. For example, if you plan to use one of this adventure's random encounters, you can have a player roll to determine what the characters encounter, rather than making the roll yourself.

#### Story Information
Important information that doesn't appear in boxed text is usually communicated to players through roleplaying. As the DM, you roleplay all the creatures that the characters encounter in the adventure. Many of the DM-controlled creatures (also called nonplayer characters, or NPCs) in this adventure know information that the characters can learn through inquiry. The adventure outlines the most likely circumstances under which a creature will share what it knows.

The adventure describes important creatures in detail, while creatures of little consequence get no more than a passing reference. As such, you have enough information to bring important creatures to life, but not so much that it becomes a chore to remember all the details. The adventure seldom goes so far as to describe what a creature sounds like, nor does it reveal everything that a creature might say or do. You're expected to improvise and bring creatures to life as best you can. For example, the adventure describes **Mister Light** (one of the owners of the Witchlight Carnival) as a flamboyant figure, but you get to decide what his voice sounds like and how he reacts to a given situation, based on what the adventure says about him. You can also ignore what the text says and roleplay **Mister Light** or any other creature as you see fit.

***Roleplaying Aids.*** *Appendix B* contains information that will help you roleplay a handful of important DM-controlled characters whose actions propel and shape the narrative of the adventure. The cards in *appendix D* serve much the same purpose but are optional; they provide roleplaying notes for several other colorful characters who aren't as pivotal. You can photocopy these cards, cut them out, and keep them in a handy stack behind your DM screen, sorted alphabetically or grouped by chapter. (The latter option works better if you expect the current game session to focus entirely on one chapter of the adventure.)

> ##### Making Mistakes
>Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone else, and even the most experienced DMs make mistakes. If you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. This is a big adventure with lots of interconnecting elements; no one expects you to internalize or memorize every aspect of it. As long as your players are having fun, everything will be just fine.

## Feywild Trinkets
The *Feywild Trinkets* table that follows offers a selection of trinkets appropriate for Feywild-themed adventures such as this one. Players whose characters have the feylost or Witchlight hand background can roll on this table instead of the *Trinkets* table in the *Player's Handbook* to determine what trinkets their characters possess. The adventure includes a few encounters that require you to roll on the table to determine what random trinkets the characters find in key locations.

## Backgrounds
This section describes two backgrounds available to characters who participate in this adventure: feylost and Witchlight hand.

## Races
All the character races presented in the *Player's Handbook* are well suited for this adventure, as are fairies and harengons.

If you allow players to create fairy or harengon characters for this adventure, they should assume that their characters are from the same world as the other player characters and have never set foot in the Feywild despite their fey heritage.

## Character Traits
![[006-00-007.butterfly.png|right|300]]

As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters' personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the *Player's Handbook*, or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn't make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table.

These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background.

##### Personality Traits

## Beginning the Adventure
How the characters become embroiled in the adventure depends on which hook you use to pull them into it. Choose either the "Lost Things" or "Warlock's Quest" adventure hook. Both hooks assume that all the characters come from the same world, even if they don't have a history together.

The adventure also assumes that the characters (even ones with the Witchlight hand background) have no prior knowledge of Zybilna, the Feywild domain of Prismeer, or the Hourglass Coven. None of these names should be familiar to them at the outset.

### Lost Things
Use this adventure hook if you want the characters to have a strong personal investment in the story. Choose a settlement in the characters' world near which the Witchlight Carnival will appear.

Each character in the adventuring party visited the Witchlight Carnival when they were a child—in fact, they snuck in without buying a ticket—and had something stolen from them. Fate brings the characters together as adults, united by the common goal of retrieving that which they've lost.

The adventure begins shortly after the Witchlight Carnival returns to the characters' world for the first time in eight years. One or more characters might be Witchlight hands or troubadours who have spent years traveling with the carnival; the remaining party members are assumed to be visitors who remember the carnival from childhood. It's possible for certain characters to know each other, either because they work together at the carnival or because they're from the same settlement.

Retrieving their lost things will require the characters to explore the Feywild regions of Hither, Thither, and Yon (described in *chapters 2*, *3* and *4*) and contend with the hags of the Hourglass Coven. The characters might be tempted to visit the Palace of Heart's Desire as well (see *chapter 5*), but they can avoid this location and still accomplish their goals.

#### Setting the Stage
After the players create their characters, use the following boxed text to kick off the adventure:

>>The traveling extravaganza known as the Witchlight Carnival visits your world once every eight years. You have a dim memory of sneaking into the carnival as a child without paying for a ticket. That memory has grown foggy over time, though it still conjures a weird admixture of emotions—wonder and awe mixed with loss and regret. During this childhood visit, your character lost something. You tried to find it, but the carnival owners—a pair of elves named **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**—were decidedly unhelpful.
>>
>>"Silly little screeching cricket," said Witch. "You forgot to buy a ticket."
>>
>>"The carnival goes round and round," said Light. "The multiverse is our playground. Nothing's free and nothing's lost. Every visit has its cost."
>>
>>As time passed, your heart became less heavy, and you gave less and less thought to those childhood events. Now, for reasons you can't explain, the longing to retrieve that which you have lost has resurfaced, as though an old spell has faded away, allowing you to feel the loss as sharply as if it happened yesterday.
>>
>>The Witchlight Carnival has returned, and you find yourself standing near a ticket booth by the entrance at twilight, just as the carnival is about to open. There you meet others who look as troubled as you. Without knowing how or why, you sense that each of them has lost something as well. Perhaps fate has brought you together.
>>

Work with the players to establish what connections, if any, the characters have with each other. For example, some or all of the characters might hail from a nearby village and have known each other for years.

Characters who have the Witchlight hand background would also know each other, since they worked together prior to the start of the adventure. They, too, are standing outside the carnival when the adventure begins.

If you haven't done so already, lay out the poster map of the Witchlight Carnival for the players to see.

#### Determining What Was Lost
Each character, having lost something precious as a child, is unable to gain *inspiration* (as described in the *Player's Handbook*) until they get back what was taken from them. A *remove curse* spell is not powerful enough to end this effect on a character, but a *wish* spell can. This might not seem like much of a drawback, as characters can cope just fine without ever gaining inspiration. Think of it more as a splinter under one's fingernail—a nagging, mildly painful annoyance that slightly diminishes one's happiness. (Hags, by their cruel actions, can spread aggravation and misery throughout the multiverse in all sorts of ways.)

The players don't know it yet, but the Witchlight Carnival operates under a peculiar set of rules. By entering the carnival without tickets as children, the characters inadvertently set themselves up to be robbed. Whatever thing was taken from each character as a child vanished suddenly while that character was distracted by the magic of the carnival. All such thefts can be traced back to the hags of Prismeer, who use thieves to acquire and collect all manner of strange things and to whom the carnival owners are beholden.

For each character in the adventuring party, roll a d8 and consult the Lost Things table to determine what was stolen from that character. If a player doesn't like their result, let them choose an option they prefer. You can swap out some of the entries on the Lost Things table with others that you or your players create, using the ones described below as models.

Use the adventure's *Story Tracker* to record what each character has lost.

##### Lost Things
| d8 | Thing |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Ability to keep secrets |
| 2 | Ability to smile |
| 3 | Artistic creativity |
| 4 | Cherished doll or stuffed animal |
| 5 | Handwriting |
| 6 | Sense of direction |
| 7 | Sense of fashion |
| 8 | Three inches of height |

The hags used each character's lost thing to craft a magic item. By interacting with the magic item in a specific way (as described below), the character regains what they lost. The magic item otherwise functions normally.

***Ability to Keep Secrets.*** The character is unable to keep a secret. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a *wand of secrets*. The character regains the ability to keep secrets by holding this wand for the first time.

***Ability to Smile.*** The character suffering from this loss is unable to smile. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a *wand of smiles* (see *appendix A*). The character regains the ability to smile by holding this wand for the first time.

***Artistic Creativity.*** The character suffering from this loss lacks the ability to be creative in one or more artistic pursuits. For example, they might be unable to draw, paint, or compose original music. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a *pipe of smoke monsters* (see *appendix A*). The character regains their creativity by puffing on the pipe for the first time.

***Cherished Doll or Stuffed Animal.*** The character lost a doll or stuffed animal (player's choice). The hag who claimed this prize has since turned it into a *talking doll* (see *appendix A*) or a stuffed animal with similar properties.

***Handwriting.*** To all other creatures, the character's handwriting is illegible and requires a *comprehend languages* spell or similar magic to decipher. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create an *instrument of scribing* (see *appendix A*). The DM chooses the kind of instrument. When the character plays this instrument for the first time, their handwriting becomes legible.

![[008-00-009.adventurer.png|right|300]]

***Sense of Direction.*** The character suffering from this loss has trouble figuring out which way is north and where they are geographically. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create an *orb of direction* (see *appendix A*). The character regains their sense of direction by holding this orb for the first time.

***Sense of Fashion.*** The character suffering from this loss has no fashion sense. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a *cloak of many fashions* (see *appendix A*). The character regains their lost sense of fashion by donning this cloak for the first time.

***Three Inches of Height.*** The character suffering from this loss knows they are shorter than they ought to be. The hag who claimed this prize has since used it to create a *pole of collapsing* (see *appendix A*). The character grows three inches in height by holding this pole for the first time.

#### Keepers of Lost Things
Once you know what has been stolen from a character, roll on the Keepers of Lost Things table to determine which hag has the thing in question. Use the adventure's *Story Tracker* to record this information.

##### Keepers of Lost Things
| d8 | Hag |
|:---:|---|
| 1–3 | **Bavlorna Blightstraw** |
| 4–6 | **Skabatha Nightshade** |
| 7–8 | **Endelyn Moongrave** |

#### Minor Curses
At your discretion, each character who lost something as a child might carry a minor curse as well. Unlike the inability to gain inspiration, this minor curse can be lifted with a *remove curse* spell or similar magic. The nature of the minor curse affecting each character depends on which hag took what the character lost. After rolling on the Keepers of Lost Things table for each character, consult the Minor Curses table to determine what minor curse besets that character.

Use the adventure's *Story Tracker* to record this information, then ask each player to also be mindful of their character's minor curse.

##### Minor Curses
| Hag | Curse |
|---|---|
| Bavlorna | You can't light nonmagical fires. |
| Skabatha | You can't tie or untie a nonmagical rope. |
| Endelyn | You can't open a door without knocking on it first. |

### Warlock's Quest
Use this hook if you or your players don't like the idea of the characters having to find things that they lost as children and would prefer a more traditional adventure setup. This hook requires that one or more characters have backgrounds unconnected to the Witchlight Carnival.

If you're using the adventure's Story Tracker, you won't need to fill out the "Lost Things" section. Just leave it blank.

In this preamble, an aging warlock named Madryck Roslof tells the characters (those not working at the Witchlight Carnival) about a faerie realm called Prismeer, which can be reached only by finding and using a fey crossing in the carnival. Madryck says that his archfey patron, Zybilna, rules Prismeer. He begs the characters to journey to this domain and find out what has happened to Zybilna, with whom he has lost contact.

If you like, you can replace Madryck Roslof with a different NPC who better suits your campaign. Whether Madryck or someone else gives the quest, the characters must travel across the land of Prismeer to reach the Palace of Heart's Desire (described in *chapter 5*), where Zybilna is frozen in time. Because this quest is more difficult than the one tied to the "Lost Things" adventure hook, the potential rewards are greater.

> ##### Warlocks of the Archfey
>If the adventuring party includes a warlock whose otherworldly patron is the Archfey, consider allowing that character's player to choose Zybilna as the warlock's patron. Warlocks who make pacts with Zybilna regard her as a generous, fairy godmother-like figure.
>

#### Setting the Stage
Identify which players have chosen the Witchlight hand background for their characters, then separate those players from the rest of the group—for now. They will join the others once everyone has gathered at the Witchlight Carnival.

To kick off the adventure, read the following boxed text to the players whose characters aren't part of the carnival:

>>You have been summoned to the abode of a human warlock named Madryck Roslof. He lives on a giant pumpkin farm, sharing his rustic farmhouse space with rodents and pixies. His adventuring days are behind him, and he looks quite old and frail. Nevertheless, he is delighted to make your acquaintance.

>>"I've acquired many treasures and made important contacts during my lengthy adventuring career," says Madryck. "I would like to pass the treasures I possess and the favors I am owed to you. In exchange, I ask that you travel to Prismeer, a domain in the Feywild, and find out what fate has befallen the archfey that rules it. This archfey, Zybilna, is my patron and inspiration—the source of my power.

The players will undoubtedly want to know more about the rewards Madryck is offering. See "Madryck's Treasure" later in this section for a summary. (If you allow your players to make wish lists of magic items for their characters, you can replace one or more of Madryck's magic item rewards with items from those lists.)

Madryck doesn't need to have a past relationship with any of the characters, but if the players want to tie Madryck more closely to their characters' back stories, allow it. Madryck is a **mage** (neutral good) who speaks Common, Sylvan, and two other languages of your choice. Although he has been out of touch with Zybilna for almost a year, he knows that time passes differently in parts of the Feywild, including Zybilna's realm of Prismeer. He can't predict how much time it will take for the characters to complete their quest; they might come back in a matter of days, or years could pass on the Material Plane before they return. Not wanting to alarm the characters, Madryck tries to steer the conversation away from issues involving the passage of time, if one or more characters mention something about it.

#### What Madryck Knows
If the characters request more information about the Witchlight Carnival, Madryck says that he hasn't visited the carnival in sixty-four years and admits that a lot can change in that time. He advises the characters to explore the carnival thoroughly on their own. He doesn't presume to know what form the fey crossing currently takes or how well hidden and protected it is. He does provide the following reliable information:

- Zybilna is a fairy godmother to mortals. She created the carnival as a means by which mortals could enter her realm and beseech her aid.
- When Madryck last visited the carnival, it was run by a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**. He assumes they're still in charge.
- Madryck dimly recalls that Witch and Light acquired the carnival more than a hundred years ago from an eladrin (an elf native to the Feywild). The eladrin's name escapes him.

If the characters request more information about Zybilna and Prismeer, Madryck offers the following descriptions, based on firsthand knowledge that is somewhat out of date:

- Prismeer is a domain of delight ruled by Zybilna, who dwells in the Palace of Heart's Desire, a magnificent structure in the heart of the domain.
- Zybilna can assume many forms and is brilliant, secretive, and wise. (Madryck doesn't know Zybilna's secret identity, as revealed in *chapter 5*.)
- When she presents herself to mortals, Zybilna usually assumes the form of a statuesque woman with long white hair and a small tattoo shaped like a chicken's foot below one eye.

Each character who hears Madryck's description of Zybilna suddenly recalls a forgotten childhood memory of her, which you can determine by having that character's player roll on the Childhood Memories table.

##### Childhood Memories
| d8 | Memory |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | When you were a small child, a woman matching Zybilna's description reunited you with a lost pet. |
| 2 | A woman matching Zybilna's description visited you once when you were sick as a child and made you feel better. |
| 3 | A woman matching Zybilna's description scared away a bully who antagonized you as a child. |
| 4 | You remember an older family member telling you about a woman with long white hair who helped deliver you when you were born. |
| 5 | A woman matching Zybilna's description gave money to your family so that you never wanted for anything as a child. |
| 6 | You used to have trouble speaking as a child until a woman matching Zybilna's description put her hand on your head. |
| 7 | You fell into an icy pond as a child and probably would have died had a woman matching Zybilna's description not fished you out of the cold water and wrapped you in a blanket. |
| 8 | You remember sneaking into the Witchlight Carnival as a child and running into a woman matching Zybilna's description. She gave you a cupcake that made you feel special when you ate it. |

![[010-00-011.madryck-roslofs-pumpkin-farm.png|right|300]]

#### To the Carnival
Characters who accept Madryck's quest can make the uneventful trek to the carnival, which is located not too far from a settlement of your choosing. The characters arrive shortly before twilight. When they arrive, lay out the poster map of the carnival for the players to see.

After revealing the map, read the following boxed text to any players whose characters have the Witchlight hand background (or skip it if no character meets this criterion):

>>Three days ago, you were approached by a friendly faerie dragon in the service of a human warlock named Madryck Roslof. This faerie dragon foretold the arrival of adventurers seeking a path to the Feywild through the carnival. Although you've heard that the carnival contains a fey crossing, you've never gone to the trouble of finding it. The faerie dragon thought you might want to help these adventurers. It even went so far as to imply that the fate of the Witchlight Carnival might hinge on the success of their endeavors.
>>
>>As twilight draws near, a large crowd begins to gather outside, eager to buy tickets and enjoy the carnival's many attractions. As you gaze upon the crowd, one or more visitors catch your eye. Something about them suggests they're not the usual rabble.
>>

Allow the characters who have the Witchlight hand background to interact as they see fit with the characters who met with Madryck Roslof. These interactions can occur before or after the carnival opens its gates to visitors.

#### Madryck's Treasure
Madryck keeps the treasure from his adventuring days in a locked wooden chest that is buried in a secret location far from his modest dwelling. He carries the chest's only key, the head of which is made of stained glass and shaped like a violet faerie dragon.

If the characters accept the quest and return with proof that Zybilna is alive and well, Madryck gives them his key and directions to the buried chest, which contains the following treasure:

- A *bag of beans*
- A *cloak of displacement*
- A suit of *+2 leather armor*
- A *+2 wand of the war mage*
- A silk bag containing eight 500 gp gemstones
- Three folded letters (described below)

***Letter 1.*** This letter is stamped with the official wax seal of a fairly large settlement (choose an appropriate town or city that exists in your campaign world). It reads, "The bearer of this letter is entitled to a favor in exchange for services, previously rendered, of a heroic nature." This letter can be presented to the settlement's leader or leaders, who would then grant the letter's bearer a favor. This favor can take the form of free room and board for up to a year, the gift of a small estate or parcel of land, an audience with someone of great influence (such as a king or queen), or some other benefit of your choosing.

***Letter 2.*** This letter has similar text to the first letter, as well as the symbol of a deity worshiped in your campaign world (choose an appropriate deity). This letter can be taken to any temple where that deity is worshiped and presented to the high priest, who would then grant the letter's bearer a favor. An example of an appropriate favor would be one free casting of a spell of 5th level or lower from the cleric spell list, such as *commune* or *raise dead*.

***Letter 3.*** This letter bears the signature and arcane sigil of Saya Kalternax, a wizard known throughout the land. (You can replace this wizard with another mage that better suits your campaign.) The letter describes the kinship between this wizard and the adventuring party to which Madryck once belonged. It concludes with, "By the terms of a magically binding agreement, the bearer of this letter is owed one favor from Saya Kalternax or, in the event of their untimely demise, one of Saya's devoted apprentices." Although Saya died a few years ago, this letter can be presented to one of their apprentices (who might be difficult to locate, at your discretion). Examples of an appropriate favor would be the brewing of a rare or uncommon potion, the scribing of a rare or uncommon scroll, or the loan of a spellbook containing a selection of wizard spells of 5th level and lower. If you need statistics for this spellcaster, use the **mage** stat block. Give the mage whatever alignment and languages you like.

If Madryck passes away before the characters return from their Feywild excursion (an event likely to occur only if the characters delay their return by a year or longer), he leaves behind a trusted associate who can give them the key and provide directions to his hidden treasure. This associate might be a friendly pixie or faerie dragon, an awakened squirrel (the beneficiary of a druid's *awaken* spell), or some other trustworthy creature of Madryck's acquaintance.

# Witchlight Carnival
The Witchlight Carnival is a fairground of kaleidoscopic tents and wagons crewed by wondrous beings, including many denizens of the Feywild. This is no ordinary carnival; it uses magic to travel from world to world across the Material Plane, visiting each world once every eight years and setting up business on the outskirts of populated areas. The carnival spends a few days at each location, then packs up and moves to another location on the same world until the decision is made to leave that world and visit the next. The carnival includes a fey crossing, allowing travel to and from the Feywild domain of Prismeer.

The characters are free to explore the carnival as they please. There are many paths through this chapter, so it can play out differently each time you run it.

![[012-01-001.chapter-splash.jpg|right|300]]

## Running This Chapter
Before running the Witchlight Carnival, follow the steps below to help make the experience smoother:

- Familiarize yourself with the layout of the Witchlight Carnival. The map that appears in this chapter is a smaller version of the carnival poster map.
- Read the chapter and familiarize yourself with the carnival's attractions. The characters can go anywhere at any time, so you need to be prepared for anything.
- Prepare the tracking devices described in "Carnival Map." You'll need a d8 to track the passage of time and another token to track the carnival's mood on the poster map.

As the characters explore the carnival, you can keep a record of key events using the adventure's *Story Tracker*.

### Mysterious Benefactor
The characters have an ally in the carnival: a planeswalking gnome bard named Ellywick Tumblestrum. The characters don't know Tumblestrum, but she knows them because her lute has magic strings that whisper secrets to her as she plucks them. These strings guided the gnome bard to the carnival and revealed to Tumblestrum that the characters' fates are intertwined with the fate of Prismeer. She has bought a ticket for each character who isn't a carnival employee. (The tickets are waiting at the ticket booth by the entrance.)

Tumblestrum can be found in the Feasting Orchard (described later in the chapter) and serves as a helpful guide if the characters need direction.

### Carnival Map
On the poster map of the carnival, use a miniature figure or some other token to mark where each character is located at any given time. If the characters split up, the tokens will make it easier to keep track of everyone.

The poster map has places to track two crucial elements: the passage of time and the carnival's mood.

#### Tracking Time
The Witchlight Carnival opens at dusk and runs for eight hours, ending just before dawn. When the characters enter the carnival, place a d8 at the start of the track in the upper left corner of the poster map with the "1" facing up. Move the die to the next space at the end of each in-game hour, and turn the die so that its uppermost face shows the hour that is now beginning. Don't worry about managing things down to the minute. If the players (and their characters) seem to be having fun, you can slow down the passage of time to give them time to enjoy the carnival's attractions. If the game starts to lag or if the characters spend a lot of time engaged in the same activity, advance the die to the next hour.

Three events take place every night at a particular hour:

- **Hour 1:** Welcome Gifts. Small gifts are handed out to lucky guests.
- **Hour 4:** Big Top Extravaganza. A midnight show gives the characters the chance to dazzle spectators and impress the carnival's ringmaster.
- **Hour 8:** Crowning the Witchlight Monarch. The carnival's climactic event gives the characters a chance to meet the carnival's mysterious owners.

Each event is detailed in the "Timed Events" section toward the end of the chapter.

#### Tracking Mood
The characters' actions in the Witchlight Carnival can affect the overall mood at the carnival. When the characters arrive at the carnival, place a token in the starting space of the track in the lower right corner of the poster map. This token moves right or left along the track as the carnival's atmosphere changes for better or worse.

The text informs you when to raise or lower the mood. When the token is to the right of the starting space, spirits are high: colors appear more vibrant, flowers bloom around the fairgrounds, and shooting stars sweep across the clear night sky. When the token is to the left of the starting space, the mood becomes darker: the calliope music plays discordantly, the staff is tense, and stormy weather looms in the sky above the carnival.

The carnival's mood is used to trigger an important meeting between the characters and the carnival owners. If the mood reaches either of the end spaces on the track, the carnival's owners invite the characters to speak with them in their wagon (see "Meeting Witch and Light" toward the end of the chapter). Characters who attend the Big Top Extravaganza can also receive an invitation to meet with the owners, even if the carnival's mood isn't in an extreme state.

> ##### Witch and Light's Hourglass Pact
>When the hags of the Hourglass Coven took control of Prismeer, they gained leverage over **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**. The hags know that Witch and Light are not the carnival's original owners and have threatened to divest them of their status by orchestrating a reunion between the Witchlight Carnival and its counterpart in the Shadowfell (which would force Witch and Light to give up the former and return to the latter).
>
>Terrified of losing their Feywild fair, the two shadar-kai have agreed to let the coven steal from anyone who sneaks into the carnival without a ticket. Witch and Light have tried to neutralize this situation by diligently checking all visitors for tickets, but some unfortunates inevitably slip through, making them targets for the hags' thieves (see "Thieves of the Coven").
>

## Carnival Owners
The owners of the Witchlight Carnival are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**. Witch is matter-of-fact and devoid of pretense, while Light is flamboyant and coy.

How Witch and Light came to possess the carnival is a story worth telling. Under different names, they owned another carnival that prowled the edges of the Shadowfell. The two carnivals crossed paths many years ago, and after much wine was consumed, the owners could not agree on which carnival was the better of the two, so they decided it would be great fun to swap ownership. Isolde, the eladrin who ran the fey-themed carnival, traded places with the two shadar-kai who ran the shadow-themed carnival. This arrangement would last until the two carnivals met again, which has not yet happened.

After trading their sinister carnival for a more lighthearted one, the two shadar-kai took the names Witch and Light. Gradually, these morose, emotionally stunted shadar-kai transformed into fun-loving free spirits who secretly dread the day when the two carnivals cross paths again. They have no desire to return to their gloomy old carnival, which is described in more detail in *Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft*.

The shadar-kai are aware that the Hourglass Coven has usurped Zybilna's domain in the Feywild. They don't know how the coven accomplished this coup, but Witch and Light would like nothing more than to see the hags defeated and Zybilna returned to power. But they dare not play a part in making that dream a reality. If the coven caught a whiff of dissent from Witch and Light, the hags would punish the shadar-kai for their impudence (see the "Witch and Light's Hourglass Pact" sidebar). Witch and Light do what they can to appease the hags while secretly rooting for Zybilna's return. They know Zybilna's true identity but dare not reveal it.

*Appendix D* contains additional roleplaying notes for **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**.

### Mister Witch
Witch, who used to go by the name Naeryx Krumple, spent his youth as a homeless orphan, eking out a meager and dreary existence on the fog-shrouded streets of Gloomwrought, a city in the Shadowfell. He earned a few coppers selling broadsheets as a young boy, then later swept floors until an old clock tower keeper took him on as a helper. The tower's clock was in such poor condition that it would break down often. Naeryx helped with the repairs and found that the work gave him a sliver of joy. When the old keeper died years later, Naeryx replaced him.

The wealthy family that owned the clock tower didn't pay Naeryx a lot of money for his work, but they occasionally had him over for dinner. He owned one fine suit that he wore on such occasions, and though he didn't care for the family's matriarch or patriarch, he enjoyed the company of their eldest son, Urmius Umbrage—a brooding shadar-kai ne'er-do-well with a cruel sense of humor. Naeryx and Urmius were close in age and got along well in all respects. Years later, without informing the rest of his family, Urmius bought a run-down carnival and persuaded Naeryx to help him operate it. Naeryx and Urmius—now calling themselves **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**—have been partners and collaborators ever since.

#### Mister Witch's Description
**Mister Witch** looks like a distinguished gentleman, for he is always dressed in fine attire. His favorite accoutrements are a top hat and a cane, and he is never without his *Witchlight watch*, which was gifted to him by the carnival's previous owner. This unique magic item is described below.

![[013-637677442905361755.png|right|300]]

### Mister Light
Light, formerly known as Urmius Umbrage, belonged to a filthy rich shadar-kai family that haunted a crumbling mansion in Gloomwrought. Although he wanted for nothing as a child, Urmius found himself surrounded by family members, caretakers, and teachers who were uniformly cold, callous, and mean-spirited. He grew tired of being seen as nothing more than the inheritor of the Umbrage estate and legacy, and he did everything in his power to make life miserable for everyone around him, especially his parents. He seemed bereft of ambition and spent much of his time playing in his room. He collected costumes and liked nothing more than to parade around Umbrage Mansion in strange garments and outlandish makeup.

Urmius first met Naeryx Krumple at a family dinner and didn't think much of the clock tower keeper at first. But Urmius found himself taken aback by Naeryx's ability to find even a small amount of joy in his work. He was eager to get to know Naeryx better, though it took a while for Naeryx to trust him. After getting his hands on some money, Urmius bought a sad little carnival that was camped on the outskirts of Gloomwrought and asked Naeryx to help him run it. For Urmius, the carnival was a chance to emerge from under his family's shadow and become the master of his own fate, but it also meant forsaking his inheritance in order to embrace the unconventional lifestyle, fashions, and friendships he desired.

![[014-637677442564423044.png|right|300]]

#### Mister Light's Description
**Mister Light** has a slender frame. He is always dressed in some sort of costume and is rarely seen in public without makeup. He carries around a fancy weather vane given to him by the carnival's previous owner. He twirls it and waves it around like a fool's scepter, but its power is far greater than he lets on. With this magic vane, he can affect the mood of everyone in the Witchlight Carnival.

## Witchlight Hands
**Witchlight hands** are the backbone of the Witchlight Carnival, a motley collection of individuals who operate many of the booths, make repairs, feed and exercise the animals, keep an eye out for thieves and other miscreants, and perform other miscellaneous tasks as **Mister Witch** dictates. A few also work part-time as performers and attractions. Although they travel to many worlds throughout the Material Plane, Witchlight hands rarely leave the carnival grounds. The carnival is the only world they know and care about.

The carnival employs 124 Witchlight hands in total. All hands enter into an agreement when they join the carnival: they must never harm another staff member, and they can't leave the carnival for more than a day at a time. (A longer absence is equivalent to resignation, in **Mister Witch**'s estimation.) On-duty staff members are required to wear fake butterfly wings strapped to their backs. **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** also furnish them with small amounts of *pixie dust* (see *appendix A*).

Witchlight hands are paid only a small fraction of the carnival's profits, but it's enough to keep them fed, clothed, and cared for. Some hands work longer hours or do extra chores to pay off debts and loans.

Most Witchlight hands are taught how to perform minor magic tricks, which they use to amuse themselves as well as entertain the masses. (Characters who have the Witchlight hand background don't learn magic as part of their upbringing, but they can choose to account for this by selecting a spellcasting class.)

## Carnival Overview
Use the following boxed text to describe the carnival to new arrivals:

>>The first stars of night twinkle above the apricot sunset. Giant dragonflies whir overhead, trailing streamers, and a low mist curls over the ground. Through a floral archway, you glimpse wondrous and vibrant creatures—elf stilt walkers, dancing faeries, and painted performers. Everywhere there is laughter, pixie dust, bubbles, and the wistful tune of a whistling calliope.
>>

The Witchlight Carnival travels as a convoy of wagons, each one pulled by horses or foxes depending on its size. When they need to soar between worlds, the wagons and their draft animals sprout butterfly wings and take to the starry sky. On land, the carnival's attractions unfold magically from the wagons, controlled by **Mister Witch**'s *Witchlight watch*.

When the carnival arrives at a new destination, a **treant sapling** named Northwind uses its Animate Trees ability to gently relocate trees that are in the way of the unfolded wagons. A great length of blue ribbon transforms into a lazy, sparkling river, encircling the site. The river is 20 feet wide and 10 feet deep at its center.

![[015-map-1.1.jpg|right|300]]

### Carnival Etiquette
There's no handbook for how guests of the Witchlight Carnival are expected to behave; certain actions are tolerated, while others cause offense. Politeness goes a long way: paying attention when spoken to, laughing at jokes, and joining in with games and singing. Every so often, you can raise the carnival's mood by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter) if the party is consistently polite to carnival staff and fellow attendees.

Conversely, acts such as interrupting someone, being rude, or grumpily refusing to dance are unfavorable. Lower the carnival's mood by 1 step if the characters actively offend anyone they meet.

#### Theft and Violence
Characters who are caught stealing or fighting are asked to leave the carnival; in this case, the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step as 1d6 **Witchlight hands** (chaotic good; see the stat block earlier in the chapter) escort the troublemakers to the gates.

### Bringing the Carnival to Life
Roll on the Carnival Scenes table to bring the carnival to life as the players explore.

##### Carnival Scenes
| d8 | Occurrence |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Two girls in face paint (a lion and a hart) squabble over a painted wooden crown that their mother won at a stall. |
| 2 | A satyr with red-and-white-striped horns plays the pipes while leading a procession of dancing rodents. |
| 3 | An elf stilt-walker tosses colorful sugary treats down to children who pass by. |
| 4 | A painted sign of an elf wearing a jester's hat springs to life and exclaims, "We hope you're having a delightful evening!" |
| 5 | A giant dragonfly swoops overhead, and its rider spills a drink over a group of Witchlight hands. |
| 6 | With a puff of glitter, a man's head suddenly turns into the head of a braying donkey, to the giggling delight of a group of mischievous pixies. |
| 7 | Giant, singing flowers burst from the ground and serenade passersby. |
| 8 | A lively jig springs up, led by a troupe of gnomish clowns. |

### Wandering Outsiders
Several meddling outsiders can be encountered at various times throughout the evening.

#### Kettlesteam
Kettlesteam is a kenku warlock whose patron is the archfey Zybilna of Prismeer. Having sensed that something is wrong with her beloved patron, Kettlesteam has come to the carnival seeking answers. The carnival owners refuse to speak to her—and until they come clean, she is committed to causing trouble. Kettlesteam uses *disguise self* to assume whatever form best enables her to mingle in crowds.

Characters can encounter Kettlesteam in more than one location; if they corner her, she provides valuable clues about Prismeer. For details, see "Catching Kettlesteam" later in the chapter.

#### Thieves of the Coven
Each member of the Hourglass Coven employs a thief that visits the carnival to steal from ticketless victims. These thieves enter and exit through the Hall of Illusions, using it as a gateway to their mistresses' splinter-realms of Hither, Thither, and Yon. The carnival staff has been instructed by **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** to ignore them.

These thieves possess a preternatural awareness of who is a carnival worker and who is a ticket-carrying visitor. Every night of the carnival, they haunt the dark spaces between wagons and attractions, scanning the crowds for ticketless interlopers. Characters who have tickets or who work at the carnival are not targets for these thieves. Some characters might catch glimpses of these spooky figures as reflections in mirrors, shadows in doorways, or out-of-place figures standing motionless in the moving crowd. Use these thieves as you please to add an undercurrent of dread or mystery to the carnival's frivolities.

The three thieves are fiercely loyal to their hag mistresses and won't willingly reveal anything if caught. They are as follows:

- **Bavlorna Blightstraw**'s thief is one of her lornlings—a miniature version of herself. Use the **quickling** stat block in *appendix C* to represent this toad-like creature.
- **Skabatha Nightshade**'s thief is Sowpig, a Small **ghoul** with 17 (5d6) hit points. She appears as a little, gray-skinned girl wearing a pig mask and holding an oversized lollipop.
- **Endelyn Moongrave**'s thief is the **detached shadow** of Gleam, a high elf acrobat who wears a crescent moon mask. (Gleam herself has vanished from the carnival. The characters won't meet her until *chapter 4*.) Gleam's **detached shadow** uses the **shadow** stat block, except it is a Fey instead of an Undead. A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 by the shadow's Strength Drain attack does not die but falls unconscious instead. The creature regains consciousness and the reduction to its Strength score disappears after it finishes a short or long rest.

Each thief has the following additional action options, which it uses to achieve its goals:

>***No Ticket.*** The thief targets one carnival guest it can see within 5 feet of it. If the target doesn't have a ticket, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. It retains no memory of events that occur while it is stunned in this way. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to this particular thief's No Ticket ability for the next 24 hours.

>***Sticky Fingers.*** The thief targets one stunned creature it can see within 5 feet of it and steals one item weighing 10 pounds or less from that creature. Whatever it steals disappears, reappearing in the space of the hag to which the thief is beholden.

![[016-01-002.hourglass-coven.png|right|300]]

## Carnival Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of the Witchlight Carnival. The ticket booth is described first, since it stands near the entrance. All other locations are presented alphabetically.

### Ticket Booth
The booth where visitors buy their tickets is located at the main entrance.

>>A silver statue of a dancing faerie is mounted on the roof of this ticket booth and surrounded by fluttering butterflies. The booth is decorated with an animated depiction of the night sky, with shooting stars arcing across it.
>>
>>An elderly goblin perches behind the ticket counter, peering at you quizzically through a spyglass. He lowers the spyglass and calls out to you: "Greetings, fair fairgoers!"
>>

Visitors are expected to buy tickets at this booth. An adult's ticket costs 8 sp, and a child's ticket costs 3 sp. Instead of paying money, a visitor can try to barter with the ticketer, Nikolas Midnight, a wrinkled **goblin** (see "Bartering for a Ticket" below). For more information on Nikolas Midnight, see "Roleplaying Nikolas" below.

Under the ticket counter is an ornate wooden box with a silver clasp and the monogram N.M. It contains one prepaid ticket for each visiting character. These tickets were purchased by Ellywick Tumblestrum, but Tumblestrum has asked Nikolas not to divulge this information. Instead, Nikolas claims that these tickets were paid for by "an anonymous benefactor."

After giving the characters their tickets, Nikolas hands the group a map of the carnival and gives each character a pair of colorful cloth butterfly wings to wear. Nikolas explains that the butterfly wings must be worn to show the staff that the characters are paid attendees. They are now free to explore the carnival at their leisure.

#### How the Tickets Work
Nikolas explains that each ticket is good for eight attractions; characters who want to sample more of the carnival's offerings must buy another ticket. Most attractions in the carnival have a cost of 1 ticket punch. After the eighth punch, a ticket becomes a worthless keepsake.

> ##### Sneaking Inside
>The carnival issues fake butterfly wings to every visitor who receives a ticket. Visitors are expected to wear their wings, or at least carry them around, while inside the carnival. The tickets and fake wings are theirs to keep.
>
>Any character who tries to sneak into the carnival without a set of fake butterfly wings must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check or be spotted and approached by 1d3 **Witchlight hands** of any alignment (see the stat block earlier in the chapter). The hands ask to see the character's ticket; any character without a ticket is escorted to the main entrance and directed to the ticket booth. If the character runs away from the Witchlight hands, the hands don't bother giving chase, but the carnival's mood lowers by one step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in this chapter). A character without butterfly wings who successfully sneaks into the carnival must repeat the check at the end of each hour.
>

#### Bartering for a Ticket
Any visitor who can't afford the price of a ticket or who doesn't want to pay for a ticket can make a fey pact with Nikolas instead. Each pact is a one-night-only deal that ends when the Witchlight Monarch is crowned (see "Timed Events" toward the end of the chapter). If a character chooses to enter into such a pact, roll on the Ticket Pacts table to determine the conditions. A character who barters for multiple tickets can have more than one pact in effect; if any table result comes up twice, choose a different result.

Any character who fulfills the conditions of a pact should be a strong contender for the title of Witchlight Monarch. A character who doesn't abide by the pact loses their ticket, which transforms into an ordinary bat and flaps away. In addition, the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

##### Ticket Pacts
| d8 | Pact |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | You must not tell a lie knowingly. |
| 2 | You must wear a crown of flowers and water it every hour without taking it off. |
| 3 | You must perform a short dance whenever you hear someone say your name. |
| 4 | You can't talk about your favorite subject. |
| 5 | You must carry around a small pumpkin as though it were a precious egg. |
| 6 | You must greet all trees with reverence. |
| 7 | You must compliment everyone you meet. |
| 8 | You must declare your love for unicorns at every opportunity. |

#### Roleplaying Nikolas
Nikolas (lawful neutral) carries a spyglass and an ear horn, which he uses when talking to patrons. Nikolas plays on the fact that he is old when using these items, but it's all a ruse; he is as sharp as a thorn, and his instruments allow him to get the true measure of guests. In his hands, the spyglass and ear horn grant Nikolas advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern lies and determine true intent. Characters who attempt to deceive Nikolas must succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the goblin's Wisdom (Insight) check.

If one or more characters seem intent on disrupting the carnival, Nikolas scribbles a brief note to that effect and hands it to an invisible **pixie** that lurks under the ticket counter. The pixie delivers Nikolas's message to **Mister Witch**, who informs the carnival staff to keep a close eye on the group, and the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

### Big Top

>>The roof of this tent reaches toward the night sky in three swooping peaks topped with spinning gold stars. Painted wooden panels on the tent walls whirl with colorful motion, displaying vibrant circus performances. The sound of music and laughter drifts out through the canvas door.
>>

Customers can enter the Big Top for free.

The Big Top is the setting for two main events: the Big Top Extravaganza and the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch, both of which are described in the "Timed Events" section toward the end of the chapter. In the hours leading up to midnight, carnival barkers stationed throughout the fair declare, "Big Top Extravaganza tonight at midnight! Prepare to be delighted!" After midnight, these barkers shout, "Who will be crowned our Witchlight Monarch? Join us in the Big Top just before dawn to find out!"

Aside from those scheduled events, a variety of entertainers perform here. Colorful orbs of light dance in the lofts of the tent while magic spotlights highlight performers. Spectators watch the acts from rows of tiered wooden seats encircling the ring. You can randomly determine an act by rolling on the Big Top Acts table, or you can create new acts using the table's entries as inspiration.

##### Big Top Acts
| d8 | Act |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Tiny firefly circus managed by an ogre dressed like a djinni |
| 2 | Halfling contortionist who can fit inside a hatbox |
| 3 | Pixies racing chariots pulled by weasels (eight pixies and sixteen weasels in all) |
| 4 | Satyr fiddler whose music causes dancing plants to burst from the ground |
| 5 | Troupe of eight clowns launching themselves from a magic cannon |
| 6 | Tiefling fire-breather who summons capering magma mephits and smoke mephits that disappear after 1 minute |
| 7 | Goblin juggler who can catch and juggle any tiny objects tossed to her by the crowd (up to eight objects at a time) |
| 8 | Elf ballerina who dances with animated costumes that spring from a magic wardrobe |

#### Dressing Room
The backstage area is a smaller, circular tent adjoining the Big Top. The curtained doorway between the Big Top and the dressing room is guarded by two **Witchlight hands** (chaotic good; see the stat block earlier in the chapter), who bicker over the appeal of the acts while sharing a bottle of pear cider. They allow only performers and other Witchlight hands to pass through the curtain but are so distracted by their arguing that any character can slip past them unseen with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check.

>>This dressing room is a scene of colorful clutter: tables strewn with makeup kits and glass jewelry, mirrors trimmed with glowing orbs of light, and chests of drawers and wardrobes spilling over with garments.
>>

If a character searches the dressing room for something fun, roll on the Costumes and Accessories table to determine what they find.

##### Costumes and Accessories
| d8 | Costume or Accessory |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Wire headband fitted with a sparkling paper unicorn horn |
| 2 | Waistcoat with a chain of one hundred silk handkerchiefs tied together in one of its pockets |
| 3 | Casket of costume jewelry |
| 4 | Front and rear halves of a two-person unicorn costume |
| 5 | Retractable dagger (harmless) |
| 6 | Pair of stilts and long, bright purple trousers |
| 7 | Enough animated face paint for five applications; each application animates on the skin to create swirling patterns that last for 1 hour |
| 8 | Clown costume with fake butterfly wings |

### Bubble-Pop Teapot

>>A twenty-foot-tall teapot rests on a wooden platform, its painted surface whirling with moving imagery of flying dragons breathing streams of bubbles. A door at the base of the teapot allows entry to its interior; those who enter emerge from the spout enclosed in a bubble that detaches to float off across the carnival. Seven goblins sits around the platform, sipping tea from mismatched porcelain cups.
>>

This ride costs 1 ticket punch. The ride is managed by a friendly goblin noncombatant named Treaclewise (chaotic good), who wears bright yellow butterfly wings and carries a string of teaspoons on his belt. Seven more friendly goblins sit and chatter around the giant teapot while sipping tea. When the characters approach, Treaclewise gestures to a sign on his table that reads:

>*The word that you intend to say,*
>
>*Try saying it a different way.*
>

Treaclewise loves to talk in rhyming slang, substituting everyday words with nonsense rhymes. When explaining how the bubble ride works, he might say the following:

- "Toil and trouble" instead of "bubble"
- "Gnarly tree knot" instead of "teapot"
- "Bramble thicket" instead of "ticket"

If a character engages with Treaclewise in rhyming slang, he chuckles and gifts the character with a pouch of Scatterleaf Tea.

***Scatterleaf Tea.*** As an action, a creature can scatter these tea leaves on the ground in a 5-foot-radius circle, duplicating the effect of a *protection from evil and good* spell that lasts for 10 minutes. To gain the spell's protection, a creature must stand in the circle of tea leaves. In addition, a cup of hot, delicious tea magically appears in the protected creature's hands. A pouch contains enough leaves for one use.

#### Taking a Bubble Ride
Any Large or smaller creature that enters the teapot is enveloped in a magic bubble that floats up through the teapot's spout and into the sky, granting its occupant wonderful aerial views of the carnival. When the bubble pops after 1 minute, the passenger floats gently to the ground. Each bubble can hold only one creature (the smaller the creature, the smaller its bubble), plus whatever the creature is wearing or carrying.

A character suspended in the bubble can make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, gaining control of the bubble on a success. The character can then steer the bubble and pop it over any location on the carnival map. On a failed check, the character has no control over their bubble, and it pops over a random location. If a character tries to steer a bubble out of the carnival, it pops at the perimeter.

### Calliope

>>A merry tune spills forth from an instrument on the back of a brightly painted wagon. A monkey wearing a cloak covered with buttons turns a handle at the wagon's rear, sending music into the air from rows of golden whistles. As you watch, a goblin dressed as a ladybug toddles up to you, rattling a tin cup.
>>

The calliope can be heard throughout the carnival and is magically linked to the carnival's mood. When people are happy, it pipes along merrily, but it plays discordantly when the mood is low. Each of the calliope's whistles is imbued with magical gusts of wind, allowing it to play without end.

Ernest the monkey turns the handle of a piano roll; the punched holes in the roll of parchment provide the melody. Ernest has the mind of a middle-aged human, the result of a prank involving the organ grinder, his pet monkey, a leprechaun, and a great quantity of brambleberry wine. The organ grinder's mind was swapped with his monkey's, but the jest turned to disaster when his body ran off with the monkey's mind inside, never to be seen again. Ernest uses the **baboon** stat block, but his Intelligence and Charisma are 10, and he can speak Common. His alignment is neutral good.

Ernest likes to collect buttons from the carnival's guests to sew onto his cloak. He has a rhyme for requesting them:

>*Spare a button if you please,*
>
>*I'll sew it next to all of these.*
>
>*I offer nothing in its place,*
>
>*Besides a smile upon my face.*
>

Marigold (chaotic good), the goblin dressed as a ladybug, collects the proffered buttons in a tin cup and delivers them to Ernest. Marigold is sprightly and often cajoles bystanders into dancing.

On the *Story Tracker*, jot down the names of characters who give at least one button to Ernest. If one or more of these characters find themselves trapped or captured in Prismeer, they hear the distant whistling of the calliope and can follow the music to safety. Any barriers or obstacles in their way are magically removed. For example, the lock on a cell door might spring open on its own, a guard might fall asleep, or a silent, spectral monkey resembling Ernest might appear and reveal the shortest route to freedom. This is a tool to help the characters out of a tight spot and can be used only once per group.

### Carousel

>>A procession of wooden unicorns stands motionless on a circular wooden platform. Fairgoers clamber onto the unicorns' backs, and a female centaur sets the ride in motion. The unicorns shake their manes and creak to life, cantering around the carousel to the delight of their riders.
>>

A ride on the carousel costs 1 ticket punch.

#### Diana Cloppington
The individual who checks tickets and operates the carousel is named Diana Cloppington. Once a human, Diana sought the help of Granny Nightshade of the Hourglass Coven, desperately wishing to be reunited with her warhorse, which went missing in battle. The cruel hag magically fused the bodies of Diana and her horse, giving her the appearance of a centaur. Diana fled Prismeer and befriended **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**, who offered her a home in their carnival.

Diana greets patrons with good humor, but there's a sadness behind her eyes. She's quick to correct anyone who calls her a centaur, saying that she's "a human who made a bad deal." If Diana discovers that the characters are investigating the carnival for their own reasons, she tells them how a hag made good on a promise to reunite Diana with her missing horse; however, due to the nature of her bargain with the hag, there are several things that Diana can't talk about:

![[018-01-004.diana-cloppington.png|right|300]]

- The Hourglass Coven
- Zybilna's current predicament
- Prismeer's current state

If she tries to speak or write about these forbidden topics, she painfully coughs up brown tree sap, or mushrooms blister on her fingers until she ceases her attempts. The carousel's wooden unicorns, however, can supply the characters with clues related to the hags (see "Riddle of the Carousel" below). Diana tells them that they must "speak to the unicorns," but to earn their trust they must learn the names of all eight unicorns. Diana gives one of the characters a clay pot of gold paint and some paintbrushes. She says she can close the carousel for a short time while it undergoes some "essential repairs."

#### Riddle of the Carousel
The carousel's eight unicorns ride in pairs, and each unicorn wears a name tag on its bridle. Some of the names are legible, while other name tags are worn and indecipherable.

The names for each pair of unicorns are key words from a well-known proverb. Before any of the unicorns share secrets with their riders, all of them must have their correct names painted on their tags. One unicorn in each pair has some letters missing from its name tag, but players who are familiar with the proverbs can fill in the missing letters.

- **First Pair** The first two unicorns are named Fortune and Bold, from the proverb "Fortune favors the bold." Fortune's name tag is complete, but Bold's name tag reads B _ _ _.
- **Second Pair** These unicorns' names are Pride and Fall, from the proverb "Pride goes before a fall." Fall's name tag is complete, but Pride's name tag reads PR _ _ _.
- **Third Pair** These unicorns' names are Stone and Moss, from the proverb "A rolling stone gathers no moss." Stone's name tag is complete, but Moss's name tag reads M _ _ S.
- **Fourth Pair** The last two unicorns are named Stitch and Nine, from the proverb "A stitch in time saves nine." Stitch's name tag is complete, but Nine's name tag reads _ _ N _.

If you are running this adventure for players who don't have a good grasp of English proverbs, use different pairs of words that the players will have an easier time identifying. For example, each pair of unicorns might have names that are synonymous with each other, such as Jolly/Merry (M E _ _ _), Breeze/Gust (G _ _ T), Tale/Yarn (_ _ R N), and Dawn/Sunrise (S _ _ _ I S _). Otherwise, choose names from idioms or proverbs with which your players are familiar.

When the characters are done painting names on the unicorns, Diana offers them a free ride on the attraction. Any unicorn whose name is incorrect gives a disgruntled whinny, and the characters learn nothing from any of the unicorns if they are ridden. If all the unicorns' names are correct, each unicorn telepathically shares with its rider three secrets about Prismeer or the Hourglass Coven during this ride. These secrets can be imparted in response to questions asked by the character, or they can be shared without a prompt if the character doesn't know what to ask.

***Lost Things Secrets.*** If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook, a unicorn shares the following information with its rider:

- The character learns which hag has the lost thing they're looking for (**Bavlorna Blightstraw**, **Skabatha Nightshade**, or **Endelyn Moongrave**).
- The character is told that Bavlorna's lair is a rambling cottage on stilts in a fey swamp, Skabatha's lair is a dead, hollowed-out tree in a sylvan forest, and Endelyn's lair is a mountaintop theater.
- The character learns a useful secret tied to the hag in question: "The hag you seek is allergic to seeing someone run widdershins" (for Bavlorna), "The hag you seek sleeps in a dollhouse and can't remember the first creature she sees when she wakes up" (for Skabatha), or "The hag you seek has foreseen her own death, which happens during an eclipse" (for Endelyn).

***Warlock's Quest Secrets.*** If you used the "Warlock's Quest" adventure hook, a character receives the following information while in telepathic contact with one of the carousel's unicorns:

- Zybilna of Prismeer is frozen in time.
- Three hags have seized control of Zybilna's domain and split it among them. Together, these hags form the Hourglass Coven.
- The hags' names are **Bavlorna Blightstraw**, **Skabatha Nightshade**, and **Endelyn Moongrave**, and their splinter-realms are called Hither, Thither, and Yon. The coven is so riddled with distrust that each hag is convinced her sisters are plotting against her.

### Dragonfly Rides

>>Huge lily pads rest on the surface of a pool glistening with phosphorescent algae. Giant dragonflies use the lily pads as landing platforms, buzzing loudly overhead with wings as brilliant as stained-glass windows, and alighting briefly to drop off and pick up excited passengers.
>>
>>Near the entrance, a small, smiling tree turns your way and beckons you over. A red squirrel clings to its leafy canopy, peering at you suspiciously.
>>

Northwind, a Prismeer native, is a carefree **treant sapling** (see the accompanying stat block). *Appendix D* contains additional roleplaying notes for Northwind. Northwind's squirrel companion, Red, sizes up guests while keeping at least one beady eye on Northwind's acorns. Red is the beneficiary of a druid's *awaken* spell; he uses the **weasel** stat block but has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common.

![[019-637677446430863372.png|right|300]]

#### Dragonfly Riding
Riding a dragonfly costs 1 ticket punch. There are eight **giant dragonflies** (see *appendix C*), which are trained to fly their riders in a lazy figure eight around the carnival's thoroughfare, at a height of 20 feet. A character who tries to steer their dragonfly off course must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to do so. On the *Story Tracker*, jot down the names of any characters who succeed on the Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to redirect a giant dragonfly; these characters have a talent that might benefit them in *chapter 4* (see area M20).

As the characters' first ride begins, shouts of alarm erupt from a nearby lily pad. A giant dragonfly has just taken off prematurely with a patron on its back: a middle-aged dwarf with a bright blue beard sits unfastened in his harness. Kettlesteam, a kenku warlock, used a *speak with animals* spell to panic the dragonfly. Characters can spot Kettlesteam before she slips away with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the kenku's Charisma (Deception) check. See "Catching Kettlesteam" later in the chapter if the characters try to confront her.

A character can calm the startled mount and guide it back to a lily pad with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The carnival's mood rises by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter) if a character succeeds on this check. If the characters fail to rescue the dwarf, he tumbles from the dragonfly's back; luckily, his fall is cushioned by a tent awning, and though he isn't badly hurt, the mood of the carnival lowers by 1 step.

#### Questioning Northwind
Northwind is terrible at keeping secrets. If questioned about the carnival, the treant loudly whispers the following bits of information, preceding each with "I'm not really supposed to talk about this, but..."

- "**Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** aren't the carnival's original owners, y'know. They're not even from the Feywild! But it matters not an inch! We're all one big, happy family here!"
- "The carnival can't run without **Mister Witch**'s pocket watch—I hope he never loses it!"
- "There's nothing **Mister Light** likes more than a sea of smiling faces—if the carnival's happy, he's happy!"

Northwind doesn't know about the Hourglass Coven or what has become of Prismeer or its archfey ruler; it thinks the domain is still thriving under Zybilna's rule.

### Feasting Orchard

>>Music and mirth radiate from this park. The heady scents of flowers, mead, and berry pie waft through the air. Stilt-walkers pluck fruit from trees; musicians drum, pipe, and strum; and everywhere there is singing, dancing, and an inordinate amount of custard.
>>

The Feasting Orchard bustles all through the night with the activity of storytellers, musicians, and acrobats. The feasting tables are lined with merrymakers, and dances spring up at the drop of a hat.

#### Faerie Cake Eating Contest
This contest runs repeatedly throughout the evening and costs 1 ticket punch to enter. The contest table is piled high with small, glazed cupcakes, each filled with a dollop of berry custard. The goal is simple: eat as many cupcakes as you can within 60 seconds.

A contestant can swallow a cupcake in about 3 seconds and safely eat as many cupcakes as 3 + its Constitution modifier; for each additional cake eaten, the contestant must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 custard damage. Subtract custard damage from the contestant's hit points as normal. Any contestant reduced to 0 hit points by custard damage is unable to continue, loses the contest, and has custard splattered all over them. At the end of the contest, all contestants regain the hit points they lost from taking custard damage.

***Treasure.*** The prize for winning the contest is a cupcake that functions like a *potion of invisibility*. The whole cupcake must be eaten to gain its benefit.

#### Ellywick Tumblestrum
This gnome bard ("Tumblestrum" to her friends) is in the Feasting Orchard when the characters first arrive. She sits on a swing that hangs from the branch of a pear tree, plucking the strings on her lute while eyeing the characters. If the characters happen to mention their free tickets, she reveals that she was the one who paid for them. When pressed for more information, she cryptically assures the characters that they're exactly where and when they're supposed to be but says no more.

![[020-01-005.ellywick-tumblestrum.png|right|300]]

As the night progresses, Tumblestrum can reappear to provide hints about what the group needs to do; she can even guide the characters to Prismeer if all of their plans fall through (see "Tumblestrum's Intervention" in the "Timed Events" section later in the chapter). If she is threatened, she disappears in a flashy yet harmless pyrotechnic display. No stat block for Tumblestrum is necessary, since she won't harm or hinder the characters and can't be seriously harmed by them. Her thoughts are likewise hidden, since no magic can read them.

Tumblestrum is meant to be an enigma to the player characters. In truth, she is a savvy planar traveler who has visited and entertained folks on countless worlds. In some corners of the multiverse, she is what's known as a Planeswalker—a fiercely independent and extremely powerful entity not to be trifled with. Tumblestrum disapproves of the Hourglass Coven's cruelty and aims to deliver some much-needed comeuppance. The gnome sees the characters as agents of change who can undo some of the damage caused by the coven, and she suspects that if they do so, the characters will be on their way to becoming heroes worthy of epic ballads.

### Gondola Swans

>>Enormous swans glide through the water here, pulling ornate wooden gondolas draped in flowers. The swans disappear into banks of silver mist as they wend their way down the river. A jetty extends ahead, at the end of which a waiting swan preens its feathers.
>>

Riding a gondola costs 1 ticket punch. Each ride is an hour long; it starts and ends at the jetty, and the gondola follows the river that marks the perimeter of the carnival.

Each gondola is pulled by a **giant swan**, which has the statistics of a **giant eagle** except that it has no talons, can attack twice with its beak as an action, and speaks Common and Auran. If the characters approach the swan at the end of the jetty, she bows her head, introduces herself as Feathereen, and explains that she can take the characters along the river that encircles the carnival. Each gondola holds up to eight Medium creatures.

Feathereen is erudite and haughty. She asks the characters several metaphysical questions as they travel, such as these:

- "What is joy?"
- "How do I know you exist?"
- "In worlds so full of magic, is time an illusion?"

If the characters ignore Feathereen or make light of her questions, she rocks the gondola and tries to pitch her passengers into the water. Each occupant must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to stay inside the boat.

Characters who impress Feathereen with their answers earn her respect; if she is questioned about the carnival, her gossipy nature is revealed, and she imparts the following information:

- Feathereen saw the mime Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions") make a disastrous attempt to propose to the mermaid Palasha. "He was about to declare his love for the mermaid in front of everyone, when the words left him with a gasp! It was most unusual, and he hasn't spoken a word since. Palasha was very upset."
- Feathereen enjoys late-night debates with the bugbear Burly (see "Staff Area" later in the chapter). "He has a profound mind and is simply wasted guarding the staff wagons. He misses his brother tremendously. No one knows what happened to Hurly, but everyone knows he never really fit in." (See area M5 in *chapter 4* for Hurly's current whereabouts.)

On the *Story Tracker*, note the names of any characters who impress Feathereen with their conversation. These characters gain debating talents that might prove useful in *chapter 5* (see area P41).

#### Development
If the characters annoy Feathereen, she is irritable for the rest of the evening, and the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). If pleased, she remains in high spirits, which raises the carnival's mood by 1 step.

### Hall of Illusions
A glass cabinet stands near the entrance to this tent. If the characters approach it, read the following boxed text aloud. If they investigate the tent first, skip ahead to "Approaching the Hall of Illusions."

>>A wooden mannequin of a grinning, raven-haired young woman in witch's attire and a green flowing cape hovers inside a glass cabinet. At the top of the cabinet, a sign reads "Tasha the Wizard—Known for Her Hideous Laughter."
>>
>>A halfling couple holds hands as they approach the glass cabinet. One of the halflings is wearing butterfly face paint. As he drops to one knee and pulls a small box from his pocket, his sweetheart bursts into laughter and begins rolling on the ground. The halfling in face paint begins sobbing and darts into the nearby tent without getting his ticket punched.
>>

Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recall that Tasha was one of the names reputedly used by **Iggwilv the Witch Queen**, a legendary archmage. Any creature that comes within 10 feet of the mannequin must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as if by a *Tasha's hideous laughter* spell. Whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, the creature can't be affected by the mannequin again.

The halfling in face paint is Rubin Sugarwood, and his halfling sweetheart is named Ween Sundapple; both are **commoners** (lawful good). Ween got too close to the glass cabinet and fell victim to its spell. If one or more characters follow Rubin into the Hall of Illusions, see "Chasing Rubin" below.

After recovering from the cabinet's spell, Ween remains outside the tent and calls out for Rubin, hoping he will return.

#### Approaching the Hall of Illusions

>>This large tent is painted with a mural of shifting images that show grinning faeries diving into pools of color. The helical stripes of the tent's pointed canopies rotate in spirals, and the whole display seems designed to befuddle onlookers. A clown dressed in muted garb stands at the tent's entrance, blinking at you.
>>

Entering the tent costs 1 ticket punch.

The veil between the Material Plane and the Feywild is thinnest inside this hall of magical mirrors, and the door to Prismeer lies deep within. The Hourglass Coven's thieves slip in and out of the tent as they desire, and most of the carnival staff prefer to give the attraction a wide berth, believing it to be jinxed or haunted.

#### Candlefoot the Mime
![[021-01-006.candlefoot.png|right|300]]

Candlefoot, a **Witchlight hand** (neutral good; see the stat block earlier in the chapter), is the reluctant ticket-puncher at the Hall of Illusions, and he does all he can to avoid entering the hall. All the color has leached out of his skin, hair, eyes, and apparel, giving him a strangely monochromatic look. And his problems don't end there.

A kenku named Kettlesteam stole Candlefoot's voice, so he communicates through mime. If the characters give him a writing implement and some parchment, he can also write out his thoughts.

*Appendix D* contains additional roleplaying notes for Candlefoot.

***A Fey Romance.*** When the mermaid Palasha (see "Silversong Lake" later in the chapter) joined the Witchlight Carnival, Candlefoot discovered that her songs had the power to bring back his coloration. (The change lasts only as long as he can hear her sing.) This surprised them both, and when the pair met, they fell in love. Recently, Candlefoot was about to propose to Palasha when his voice was snatched by Kettlesteam. If questioned, Candlefoot tries to explain his sorry circumstances through mime and asks the characters to help him recover his voice from Kettlesteam so he can go through with his proposal.

Here's a fantastic opportunity for you to explore your hidden talents as a mime. To indicate that he has lost his voice, Candlefoot might move his lips, then shake his head while holding a hand up to one ear. He might bob his head and flap his arms like a bird to indicate that Kettlesteam is the culprit. He doesn't know where the kenku is, but he knows she has been causing mischief throughout the carnival and sometimes uses magic to conceal her true form.

If the characters agree to help Candlefoot, he performs a few delightful magic tricks for their amusement using his *prestidigitation* cantrip, which he can cast without the verbal component.

#### Inside the Hall of Illusions
Tall mirrors line the interior walls of the tent. The mirrors near the entrance reflect onlookers in their youth; the images grow steadily older, until the mirrors deep within the hall reflect onlookers in their twilight years. As the characters scrutinize their reflections, ask the players to describe what their characters looked like as children and what they might look like in old age.

When the correct incantation is spoken aloud in front of any of the hall's mirrors, the mirror transforms into a portal to the Feywild domain of Prismeer (see "Through the Looking Glass" at the end of the chapter for more information).

#### Chasing Rubin
If the characters chase after Rubin when he enters the hall, Candlefoot looks shocked but doesn't follow them inside.

Any character who spends 1 minute searching for Rubin finds him with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The halfling is gazing worriedly into a mirror, and a little girl in a pig mask can be seen in the pane, whispering to the halfling's youthful reflection. As soon as she sees the characters, the girl turns and disappears. This figure is Sowpig (see "Thieves of the Coven" earlier in the chapter), who is trying to lure the halfling to Thither so that **Skabatha Nightshade** can tempt him into a nefarious bargain. Rubin reveals that girl in the pig mask asked him if he had any regrets, and said that if he did, she knew someone who could help him—he just had to follow her.

If the characters fail to find Rubin after 3 minutes, they come upon him as he steps into the mirror to join the girl in the pig mask. After he passes through the pane, his youthful reflection takes the girl's hand and walks away with her. The ring he intended for his sweetheart drops to the floor inside the hall as he disappears. Characters who try to follow Rubin are unable to pass through the mirror as he did.

#### Development
On the *Story Tracker*, jot down the names of any characters who succeeded on the Intelligence (History) check to know that Tasha and Iggwilv are one and the same, because this information proves useful in *chapter 5*. Also note if Rubin was led away by Sowpig, as the characters might encounter him again in *chapter 3* (see area L13).

If the characters reunite the halfling couple, Ween accepts Rubin's proposal, and the carnival's mood rises by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). If Rubin and Ween are not reunited, the mood of the carnival lowers by 1 step as word of Rubin's disappearance spreads.

### Lost Property

>>Outside the lost property wagon is a large feline creature with midnight-blue fur. It has a pair of tentacles extending from its shoulders and wears fake butterfly wings. Hanging from its collar is a small wooden keg. The creature roughhouses with two young boys. One boy squeals, "Again, Dirla, again!" while the other hangs onto the creature's neck.
>>

Dirlagraun is a gray-whiskered **displacer beast** that looks after stray children until they can be reunited with their parents. The keg fastened to its collar is filled with toffee apple juice and fitted with a spigot for easy pouring. The juice never fails to console an upset child.

When the characters arrive, the displacer beast is minding two boys named Viro and Allowin while their mother fetches food and drink. The displacer beast is unusual both in disposition and in its ability to speak Elvish and Sylvan. *Appendix D* contains additional roleplaying notes for Dirlagraun.

#### Missing Child
![[022-01-007.dirlagraun.png|right|300]]

If the characters question Dirlagraun, it quietly cautions them that some things go missing from the Witchlight Carnival and never come back. Before it can say more, Viro, the older of the two boys, picks up a mirrored ball from the lost property wagon. In a rare moment of anger, Dirlagraun snatches the ball back with a snarl and a flick of its tentacle, causing Viro to dash away in fright.

Unable to leave the younger boy, Allowin, alone, Dirlagraun pleads with the characters to go after Viro. Any character who searches for Viro can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, locating him in a nearby candy stall on a success. If Viro isn't found, a character can repeat the check after continuing the search for another 10 minutes. If Viro is not found within the hour, the carnival's mood lowers by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

If the characters return with Viro, Dirlagraun is grateful and reveals that, many years ago, its own cub vanished from the carnival without a trace. The cub's name is Star, and all Dirlagraun has to remember Star by is its favorite toy—the small, mirrored ball that Viro grabbed. If one or more characters declare their intention to search for Star, Dirlagraun gives the mirrored ball to them.

Unknown to anyone who works at the carnival, Star followed Sowpig (see "Thieves of the Coven" earlier in the chapter) through a mirrored portal in the Hall of Illusions. The characters might encounter Star in *chapter 3* (see "Little Oak").

#### Troubling Times
Dirlagraun is concerned that **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** are on edge. If the characters are willing to investigate, Dirlagraun advises against confronting the carnival owners directly. Instead, the displacer beast suggests that the characters sneak into the Staff Area behind the Big Top and spy on them.

### Mystery Mine

>>Propelled by magic, mine carts laden with fairgoers trundle into an opening carved like a dragon's mouth. The carts reappear moments later on the far side of the attraction, with the passengers expressing a mixture of bewilderment, fear, and excitement.
>>
>>Near the entrance, a male dwarf dressed like a wizard shouts, "Unlock the mysteries of your mind in the Mystery Mine!" He has bushy eyebrows, wears a pointy hat, and holds a large clockwork contraption shaped like a giant eye.
>>

This ride costs 1 ticket punch.

The mine is the brainchild of an eccentric dwarf named Zephixo—the same individual standing outside it. He uses the **mage** stat block, with the following changes:

- Zephixo (chaotic good) speaks Common, Dwarvish, Gnomish, and Sylvan.
- He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison.

Zephixo beckons visitors toward his "All-Seeing Eye" contraption. If the characters look into the eye, ask each player to write down their character's name alongside the name of a creature the character fears. Collect their notes and refer to them during the ride. Characters who don't gaze into the All-Seeing Eye can still enter the mine, at the cost of having a much less exhilarating experience.

#### Riding the Mystery Mine
Each mine cart holds up to eight Medium creatures. As the characters pass through the dragon's mouth, the ride plunges them into an illusion-filled demiplane of undulating hills, corkscrewing trees, and prismatic skies.

As the characters' cart hurtles along the track, refer to the players' notes. Illusory forms of the characters' worst fears launch themselves at the mine cart, and it's up to you to describe how these fears manifest. The number of illusory forms equals the number of riders in the cart, and each character is confronted only once by their worst fear.

Each of the cart's riders must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw as each illusion appears. If the illusion a character faces is their own fear, they have disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a character is compelled to scream as the illusion terrifies them to the core; on a successful save, the character laughs at the illusion as it rushes by harmlessly. Ask the players to keep track of how many of these saving throws their characters fail.

Any character who succeeds on all the saving throws gains advantage on all Charisma-based ability checks made at the carnival. This effect lasts until the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch (see "Timed Events" toward the end of the chapter).

Any character who fails three or more of the ride's saving throws is haunted by nightmares for 1d8 days. Until the nightmares end, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw after finishing a long rest or gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion. On the *Story Tracker*, record the character's name and the number of days remaining until the nightmares cease, reducing that number by 1 after each long rest. Any spell that ends a curse rids the character of these nightmares but doesn't remove levels of exhaustion gained as a result of them.

### Pixie Kingdom

>>A copse of oak trees shelters a miniaturized fairground. At its heart, a hamster runs inside a tiny Ferris wheel, encircled by minuscule wagons and candy stalls. A pixie sits cross-legged in the hollow of a tree at the entrance to this realm.
>>

The **pixie** introduces himself as Jeremy Plum and does his best to persuade the characters that the Pixie Kingdom is the best attraction the carnival has to offer. Entry to the attraction costs 1 ticket punch.

Jeremy encourages the characters to adopt pixie names before entering; refer to the table below for ideas. The carnival's mood rises by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter) if all the characters use their adopted pixie names while in the attraction.

#### Pixie Names

| d8 | Name |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Brightmite |
| 2 | Cobweb |
| 3 | Cotton Candy |
| 4 | Dimple |
| 5 | Jellybean Starfish |
| 6 | Panache |
| 7 | Puddlemud |
| 8 | Toadhop |

Whether or not the characters agree to adopt their pixie names, Jeremy sprinkles *pixie dust* (see *appendix A*) on them. Jeremy also presents each character with a potion that, when consumed within the boundary of the Pixie Kingdom, reduces the imbiber's size to Tiny for 1 hour, or until the imbiber wants the effect to end. Until the effect ends, the Tiny character has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the character's weapons deal 2d4 less damage (this change can't reduce the damage below 1).

#### Exploring the Kingdom

>>The Pixie Kingdom is a tranquil oasis compared to the rest of the bustling carnival. The air is filled with the aroma of blackberry wine and flower blossoms. Eight brightly painted doorways are nestled in the bark at the bases of the surrounding trees.
>>

Twelve **pixies** reside here during carnival hours. They are friendly, curious, and eager to ask new arrivals all sorts of questions. The characters are free to explore the kingdom and experience the following wonders:

- One character at a time can ride Pinecone, an excitable pug that listens only to pixies.
- The kingdom's centerpiece is a pixie palace made entirely of old cocoon husks beautifully woven together.
- Characters can dine on cucamelon sandwiches and thimbleberry tarts inside one of the pixie cottages.
- Characters can ride the wheel, which is powered by a talkative hamster named Biscuit. An *awaken* spell cast on the hamster gives it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common.

Characters who spend time talking to the pixies or Biscuit learn the following rumors:

- "Everyone's on the lookout for a kenku troublemaker, but she's using magic to disguise herself."
- "Candlefoot the mime and Palasha the mermaid are in love. On top of that, Candlefoot's lost his voice. Is that part of his act?"
- "Burly the bugbear often talks philosophy with one of the gondola swans. That bugbear has brains as well as brawn."

#### Playing Hide-and-seek
After a short while, the characters are invited to play a game of hide-and-seek, organized by two **pixies**: the game's friendly supervisor, Honeymint, and a seeker named Starbug. On the *Story Tracker*, jot down the names of any characters who play hide-and-seek with the pixies; this experience might prove useful in *chapter 3* (see area L5).

Each character who plays the game makes a Wisdom (Stealth) check to hide (see the *Player's Handbook* for rules on skills with different abilities). Starbug finds the character who has the lowest check result, at which point all the remaining characters move to new hiding places and make another check. The game continues until only one character remains hidden; this character is declared the winner and is awarded a packet of *pixie dust* (see *appendix A*), with two leaves as the propeller blades. No character can win this prize more than once.

The characters can hide anywhere in the Pixie Kingdom, but Honeymint points out the following hiding spots before the game begins:

- **Biscuit's Wheel** This wooden wheel has eight wicker carriages. Biscuit, the hamster who trundles around inside the contraption that turns the wheel, is very talkative. Offering food to the hamster is one way to keep him quiet.
- **Flower Bed** This area is home to several talking wildflowers. They're rather conceited and bicker over which of them has the silkiest petals and the finest aroma. Flattery can silence their bickering.
- **Heron's Nest** An awakened heron named Beatrice, who enjoys talking about the weather, roosts in a clump of long grasses and might allow characters to hide in her nest if they ask nicely.

Any character who tries to hide in one of these locations must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check to shush the creatures there. Success grants advantage on Wisdom (Stealth) checks made to hide in that location.

### Silversong Lake

>>Mist gathers at the banks of a shimmering lake. Near its center, a mermaid lounges in a giant bowl, singing a glorious, haunting song that captivates spectators on the lakeshore. In response, the lake water coalesces into magical sculptures that whirl around her as she performs.
>>

![[023-01-008.palasha.png|right|300]]

It costs nothing to visit the lake and behold its star attraction: the **merfolk** Palasha (chaotic good). Audiences crowd the lakeside just to witness her beauty and hear her song.

Palasha is no ordinary mermaid. Her singing has the ability to emulate the effects of a *control water* spell. Once per day, as an action, she can also summon a **swarm of Quippers** that obeys her commands until it disappears after 1 minute.

Palasha is in love with Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions") but finds it tragic that he has lost his voice. She can't face seeing him after his very public marriage proposal went awry. The mermaid is also fiercely devoted to the carnival. "We are an impossibility in an impossible universe," she tells colleagues and strangers alike, with great pride. *Appendix D* contains additional roleplaying notes for Palasha.

#### Feathered Heckler
This event occurs the first time the characters watch Palasha perform. Kettlesteam, the kenku warlock, snakes through the crowd, using *disguise self* and Mimicry to pose as different hecklers. After three mean-spirited jeers, the mermaid falters in mid-song, leaps out of her bowl, and darts off, heading downriver. Her abrupt departure causes the carnival's mood to lower by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

![[024-01-009.guess-the-number-of-feathers.png|right|300]]

Characters who try to identify the hecklers can spot Kettlesteam in her current guise with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the kenku's Charisma (Deception) check. See "Catching Kettlesteam" later in the chapter if the characters try to corner her.

#### Helping Palasha
If she is driven from Silversong Lake by heckling, Palasha takes refuge in the river near the Hall of Illusions. To coax her back to the lake, the characters must perform an act of gallantry, such as helping Candlefoot find his lost voice.

If the characters persuade Palasha to return to the lake and resume her performance, the carnival's mood rises by 2 steps (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). Palasha offers a singing lesson to any characters who helped her. On the *Story Tracker*, jot down the names of characters who received a singing lesson from the mermaid. Their talent might benefit them in *chapter 3* (see "Uncorrupted Fairy Rings").

### Small Stalls
![[025-01-010.catch-the-dragon-by-the-tail.png|right|300]]

The fair boasts several small stalls, each run by a **Witchlight hand** (variable alignments; see the stat block earlier in the chapter). Some of the stalls sell sweet snacks and drinks. For 1 ticket punch, a customer can buy a snack served on a large flower petal or a beverage served in a fist-sized snail shell. The offerings include:

- Blue-frosted cupcake
- Candied apple on a stick
- Euphoreo cookie (saucer-sized cookies dusted with particles of faerie dragon euphoria gas)
- Eveningberry wine (a sweet, nonalcoholic drink)
- Faerie bell nectar (harvested from faerie bell flowers)
- Pixie tarts (powdered candy in little cups)
- Sugar-glazed button mushrooms
- Tree sap lollipop

The remaining stalls offer games and contests that cost 1 ticket punch apiece. A handful of games are summarized in the Carnival Games table and described below, and you can create others as you see fit using these as models.

##### Carnival Games
| Game | Key Ability |
|---|:---:|
| Almiraj Ring Toss | Dexterity |
| Catch the Dragon by the Tail | Wisdom |
| Gnome Poetry Contest | Charisma |
| Goblin Wrestling | Strength |
| Guess the Number of Feathers | Intelligence |
| Outstare the Cyclops | Constitution |

If a character wins a prize playing a game, roll a d8 on the Carnival Prizes table to determine the prize.

##### Carnival Prizes
| d8 | Prize |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Trinket (determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets table in the introduction). |
| 2 | Wooden wand with 8 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 of the wand's charges to cast the *prestidigitation* cantrip. This wand can't be recharged. |
| 3 | Packet of *pixie dust* (see *appendix A*). |
| 4 | Bottle of Witchlight wine. While the bottle is uncorked, it plays calliope music until the bottle is emptied of wine. |
| 5 | Replica unicorn horn filled with candy. |
| 6 | Single application of magic face paint. As an action, you can apply the face paint to yourself or another creature. The recipient gains the benefit of a *disguise self* spell that lasts for 1 hour or until the recipient chooses to end the effect. |
| 7 | Cuddly toy spider. As an action, you can stroke the spider to gain the benefit of a *spider climb* spell that lasts for 1 hour. Once used, the toy turns into a real spider and crawls away. |
| 8 | Glove puppet in the shape of a wizard. As an action, you can move the puppet's arms to cast the *minor illusion* cantrip. After three uses, the puppet disappears in a puff of smoke. |

![[026-01-011.almiraj-ring-toss.png|right|300]]

#### Almiraj Ring Toss

>>"This almiraj is no mirage. Adorn its horn with two or three rings to win a prize!"
>>

This game involves tossing rings over the horn of a wooden statuette of an almiraj (a cute, bunny-like creature with a horn like a unicorn's). The almiraj teleports around on a tabletop, making it hard to score a success. A participant gets three rings. Tossing a ring over the almiraj's horn requires a successful DC 17 Dexterity check. Two successful tosses earn one roll on the *Carnival Prizes* table; three successes earn two rolls on the table.

#### Catch the Dragon by the Tail

>>"Prizes! Prizes! Prizes! Catch the faerie dragon by the tail and win a piece of its hoard!"
>>

While blindfolded and standing in a booth, a participant must grab the tail of an elusive, giggling **red faerie dragon** that flutters around them. The participant has three chances to succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. Someone who succeeds on the check catches the dragon by the tail and rolls once on the *Carnival Prizes* table, or twice if the successful check occurs on the first attempt.

#### Gnome Poetry Contest

>>"Sound the chime, it's time to rhyme! You bring the poem! We'll bring the gno-em!"
>>

![[027-01-012.gnome-poetry-contest.png|right|300]]

A participant must outperform a gnome in a best-of-five poetry contest. Doing so requires three successful DC 15 Charisma (Performance) checks in five or fewer attempts. Someone who wins the contest rolls once on the *Carnival Prizes* table, or twice if they succeeded three times without failing a check.

#### Goblin Wrestling

>>"Strong folks! Test your mettle in a goblin wrestle!"
>>

A Small participant has to pin an unarmed **goblin** (lawful good), while a Medium participant has to pin one goblin while wrestling two of them. Winning the game requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check contested by the goblin; two goblins working together make one check with advantage. Resolve a tie by rerolling. A victorious participant earns one roll on the *Carnival Prizes* table.

#### Guess the Number of Feathers

>>"Birds of a feather? How about feathers of a bird? Step right up and guess how many feathers festoon this fiendish fowl!"
>>

A participant gets three tries to guess the number of feathers on one of a group of caged **cockatrices**. Someone who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence check guesses correctly and earns one roll on the *Carnival Prizes* table, or two rolls if the successful check occurs on the first attempt.

#### Outstare the Cyclops

>>"What do you do when the eye of the cyclops falls upon you? You stare right back if you've got the stamina!"
>>

Winning this game requires a participant to outstare an illusory cyclops. Whoever blinks first loses. To win the game, the contestant must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution check. Someone who wins the game receives a prize, determined by rolling once on the *Carnival Prizes* table.

![[028-01-013.outstare-the-cyclops.png|right|300]]

### Snail Racing

>>The grandstands next to this racecourse are filled with cheering fairgoers ringing bells, swinging rattles, and waving flags. On the starting line, eight giant snails are having their shells scrubbed by pixies.
>>
>>Above the circular course, a wooden gantry hangs from the branches of a central tree, where two goblins officiate the proceedings.
>>

Snail racing is a highly competitive, fast-paced sport that draws a lively crowd. Characters can participate in the race as snail jockeys, but it costs 1 ticket punch to enter. On the *Story Tracker*, jot down the names of any characters who take part in the snail racing, as the experience might prove useful in *chapter 2* (see "Reaching the Bottom").

If at least half the characters participate in a snail race, the carnival's mood rises by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). If anyone breaks the rules, the mood lowers by 1 step.

#### Snails and Pixies
Each of the eight **giant snails** (see *appendix C*) is assigned a crew of three **pixies** to prepare it for a race. The snails are unusually fast, wear colored caparisons, and have numbered saddles strapped to their shells. Their racing numbers, names, and team colors are given in the Giant Snails table.

##### Giant Snails
| Number | Name | Team Color |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Shellymoo | Pink |
| 2 | Nimblefoot | Blue |
| 3 | High Road | Purple |
| 4 | Quickleaf | Green |
| 5 | Flowerflash | Yellow |
| 6 | Whizzy | Orange |
| 7 | Breakneck | Red |
| 8 | Queen's Majesty | Black |

![[029-01-014.snail-racing.png|right|300]]

#### Snail Racing Rules
Every snail needs a jockey, and any saddles not filled by characters are filled by other attendees (use the **commoner** stat block to represent these NPCs). All the snails and their riders begin at the start line; fireworks signal the start of the race, after which the riders race their snails to the finish line.

On a whiteboard or notepad, jot down the giant snails, their numbers, and their riders. Next to the names, keep a running total of how far each snail travels in feet during the race. The course is 480 feet long.

***Racing Rules.*** The race is divided into 6-second rounds. Once the race begins, the snails move along the track at remarkable speed, each one covering 80 feet per round by itself. Without riders, the snails are an even match, but a jockey can try to improve a snail's performance by patting its shell or speaking words of encouragement at it.

Initiative rolls are unnecessary. Once per round, each jockey can make a DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a successful check, the jockey's snail moves an extra 10 feet that round, or 20 feet if the check succeeds by 5 or more. On a failed check, the jockey's snail moves 10 feet slower that round, or 20 feet slower if the check fails by 5 or more. The race ends when one or more snails travel the 480 feet needed to cross the finish line.

If two or more snails cross the finish line in the same round, determine the winner of the race by having those snails' jockeys each roll a d20. The highest roll determines the winner, with one snail narrowly claiming victory. If the roll for first place is tied, the race ends in a tie, and each winning jockey receives the first-place prize (see "Prizes" below).

Signs posted in the stands and along the racetrack warn that neither jockeys nor spectators may influence the outcome of a race by using magic or by harming other jockeys or snails. Any jockey who openly does so is disqualified, as is the jockey's snail. A spectator caught doing so is escorted from the carnival by 1d4 **goblins** (lawful good) who are watching the crowd closely for troublemakers.

***Surprises.*** At the start of each round after the first, roll a d8 and consult the Snail Race Surprises table to determine if something unexpected happens that round. When a surprise occurs, determine which snail is affected by rolling a d8.

##### Snail Race Surprises
| d8 | Surprise |
|:---:|---|
| 1–3 | No surprise. |
| 4 | One random snail gets a stitch, reducing its speed by 40 feet this round. |
| 5 | A spectator throws a head of lettuce at one random snail. The snail stops to eat the lettuce and doesn't move at all this round. |
| 6–7 | One random snail is bolstered by the cheering crowd and moves an extra 20 feet this round. |
| 8 | The saddle on one random snail comes loose and falls off. The snail's jockey must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to remain atop the snail. On a failed save, the jockey falls off, and the snail continues the race on its own. |

***Prizes.*** The jockey whose snail wins the race receives a *potion of advantage* (see *appendix A*). The jockey whose snail comes in last receives a consolation prize, provided they weren't disqualified. The consolation prize is a magic wand that allows its holder to cast the *dancing lights* cantrip once. Once used to cast this spell, the wand turns into a tulip.

### Staff Area

>>A tangled wall of thorns surrounds a cluster of wagons lit by lanterns. This caravan is barely visible through the thicket.
>>

The carnival's wagons are located behind the Big Top, protected by a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-thick wall of thorns. When a member of the carnival staff stands within 1 foot of the wall, the thorns part to form an 8-foot-high, 4-foot-wide doorway in front of the staff member. This door remains open for 10 seconds, then disappears as thorny vines fill the opening once more. The wall is magical and also impervious to damage. The wall grants three-quarters cover to creatures behind it.

A creature can move through the wall of thorns, albeit slowly and painfully. It costs 8 feet of movement to move through 1 foot of the wall. The first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Whenever a creature ends its turn in the wall, trumpet-shaped flowers burst from the brambles nearby and honk an alarm that is audible up to 50 feet away.

#### Circle of Wagons
Enclosed by the wall of thorns is a circle of eight brightly painted wagons, one of which is a glass-enclosed water tank for Palasha the mermaid. The fanciest of the remaining seven wagons belongs to **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**.

![[030-01-015.burly.png|right|300]]

The perimeter inside the wall of thorns and outside the circle of wagons is patrolled by a **bugbear** named Burly (neutral good), who leaves his post once during the evening to participate in the Big Top Extravaganza (see "Timed Events" later in the chapter). While on patrol, Burly wears a large jack-o'-lantern on his head, as one would wear a helmet, in addition to his dungarees and fake fairy wings.

The central area enclosed by the wagons is guarded by Thaco the clown, a human **Witchlight hand** (chaotic neutral; see the stat block earlier in the chapter) who is loyal only to **Mister Witch**. He usually sits right outside the door to Witch and Light's wagon, blowing bubbles with his bubble pipe.

Burly and Thaco dislike each other, so they don't fraternize while on guard duty. *Appendix D* contains additional roleplaying notes for them.

Characters caught snooping around the wagons without an escort are evicted from the carnival and must find a way to sneak or barter their way back in.

#### Witch and Light's Wagon
**Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** (see their stat blocks earlier in the chapter) are in their wagon throughout the evening, except during the Big Top Extravaganza (which Light attends and Witch does not) and the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch (which they both attend). See "Timed Events" later in the chapter for more information.

Refer to the "Carnival Owners" section for more information about Witch and Light. Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for the pair.

Characters who sneak up to the wagon while it's occupied can overhear Witch and Light talking:

>>Two contrasting voices emanate from the wagon.
>>
>>*Mister Witch, in a low and gravelly voice:* "You need to find a way to calm down."
>>
>>*Mister Light, in a high-pitched, shrill voice:* "I'll calm down when that kenku pest is gone."
>>
>>*Witch*: "She knows nothing. She'll get frustrated soon enough and be on her way."
>>
>>*Light*: "I hope you're right."
>>
>>*Witch*: "Trust me."
>>

From there, the conversation shifts to the current mood of the carnival and ideas for new carnival acts or attractions ("The catoblepas didn't work out, but maybe we can buy a giraffe and paint it blue. Or we could teach Northwind how to play the fiddle.") Then it turns to the mysterious disappearance of Burly's unruly brother, Hurly (in hushed tones that suggest Witch or Light might have had a hand in it, although neither admits any involvement). Hurly's fate is revealed in *chapter 4* (see area M5).

![[031-01-016.thaco.png|right|300]]

If the characters disturb Witch and Light in their wagon without being invited, jump ahead to the "Meeting Witch and Light" encounter described later in the chapter, skipping over the lead-in with Burly and Thaco.

***Searching the Wagon.*** **Mister Witch**'s bunk is neat and unadorned. **Mister Light**'s bunk is gaudy and messy, with costumes strewn everywhere. Characters who search through the gear find a hatbox containing the crown of the Witchlight Monarch; this splendid crown of gold butterflies teleports back to its hatbox at the end of each evening and is ceremoniously produced from its box during the monarch's coronation (see "Timed Events" later in the chapter).

Any character who searches the wagon for secret compartments finds one with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The compartment is located in a bench and contains a tiny, bejeweled chest worth 50 gp. This chest is a replica of a much larger chest hidden on the Ethereal Plane (with the help of a *Leomund's secret chest* spell). While holding the replica chest, **Mister Witch** can use an action to summon the larger chest. He can send the larger chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.

***Treasure.*** The chest hidden on the Ethereal Plane (which is worth 5,000 gp) contains recent earnings (210 sp and 70 gp), a *potion of diminution*, a *potion of growth*, and a *potion of advantage* (see *appendix A*). The potions are not labeled, but **Mister Witch** knows which is which.

## Carnival Events
This section describes special events that occur during the characters' visit to the carnival.

### Meeting Witch and Light
The characters receive an invitation to meet privately with **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** when the carnival's mood reaches either end of the track (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter) or if the characters impress **Mister Light** during the Big Top Extravaganza (see "Timed Events" later in the chapter).

Witch and Light send Burly the **bugbear** (neutral good) to fetch the characters:

>>A bugbear wearing dungarees, fairy wings, and a helmet made from a jack-o'-lantern approaches you. "Follow me," he growls. "Management wants to see you."
>>

With a wave of his hand, Burly creates an opening in the wall of thorns that surrounds the staff wagons (see "Staff Area" above) and leads the characters through it. If questioned about the nature of the meeting, Burly insists there's nothing to worry about. If the carnival's mood is good, he adds that his bosses are in high spirits. Appendix D contains additional roleplaying notes for Burly.

If the characters follow Burly, read:

>>The bugbear leads you to a circle of wagons. Leaning against a particularly ostentatious wagon is an aging clown with a painted grin. He puffs on a bubble pipe and glares at you as the bugbear, ignoring the clown, opens the wagon's door and ushers you inside.
>>

The clown is Thaco, a human **Witchlight hand** (chaotic neutral; see the stat block earlier in the chapter) and over-the-hill carnival attraction. *Appendix D* contains additional roleplaying notes for Thaco.

![[032-01-017.witch-and-light.png|right|300]]

#### Inside the Wagon

>>A flamboyant elf grins from ear to ear as he welcomes you into the wagon with a theatrical bow. "Please come in, it's a delight to meet you all! I am **Mister Light**, and this is my associate, **Mister Witch**."
>>
>>He gestures to a stocky elf lounging on a bunk. **Mister Witch** nods to you and doffs his top hat.
>>

Stat blocks for **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** appear earlier in the chapter.

**Mister Light** gestures toward his scepter—the *Witchlight vane*—and explains that it picks up every nuance of emotion in the carnival. If the carnival's mood is good, Light expresses his gratitude for the cheer that the characters have brought to the carnival so far. If the carnival's mood is bad, he expresses his regret that the characters aren't having a delightful time and notes that, in turn, they're spoiling everyone's evening.

Witch and Light are eager to learn the characters' reasons for visiting the carnival; if the characters are motivated by the "Lost Things" adventure hook, Witch and Light dimly remember the characters from when they visited the carnival as children.

If the characters attack the carnival owners, they're swiftly restrained by Burly and Thaco, who try to knock them out and dump them outside the carnival. Characters who overcome the carnival owners and their guards are begrudgingly taught the secret incantation to reach Prismeer (see "Through the Looking Glass" at the end of the chapter).

#### Questioning Witch and Light
If the characters have come to the carnival seeking lost things, Witch and Light express their regret but make it clear that they're not responsible for those losses, claiming "forces are at work on the other side that are entirely beyond our control." **Mister Witch** adds, "The wheel of time turns ever on... what's lost is lost, what's gone is gone."

If they are questioned about conversations that were overheard (see "Witch and Light's Wagon" above and "Catching Kettlesteam" below), Witch and Light admit they're not the carnival's original owners and took over management through an honest pact with the owner of another carnival.

If asked about Kettlesteam, Witch and Light say she's "a disgruntled guest and troublemaker whose fey patron, Zybilna, dwells in the Feywild domain of Prismeer." They add that Zybilna is also the patron of the Witchlight Carnival, but Witch and Light have had no contact with her for some time. Throughout the conversation, Witch and Light never mention the Hourglass Coven.

#### Meeting's End
To end the meeting, **Mister Witch** takes a quick look at his *Witchlight watch*, then nods to Burly to escort the characters from the wagon. If the carnival's mood is good, **Mister Light** offers each character a gift as they exit: a balloon animal of their choosing, crafted by Thaco, "a clown of few words but many talents." Thaco fashions each balloon into whatever creature is asked for. Each balloon animal is tied with a ribbon and floats magically in the air.

### Burly's Plan
Following the characters' meeting with Witch and Light, Burly pulls the characters aside for a hushed conversation:

>>Burly removes his jack-o'-lantern helmet, revealing a worried expression. "Bad things have been happening at the carnival for a while. People and things have been going missing. My bosses know more than they're telling, but their hands are tied somehow. You're the first people I've met who might be able to set things right. Witch and Light are good guys, but you'll need leverage to make them spill the beans."
>>

Burly suggests the characters purloin **Mister Witch**'s *Witchlight watch* (without which the carnival can't stay on schedule) and use it to compel Witch and Light to provide the answers they seek. He proposes that the best time to swipe the watch is during the Big Top Extravaganza, since it's the only time when Witch and Light are separated. Although he doesn't condone theft, Burly has talked himself into believing that it's not really stealing if the characters give back the watch. Burly offers to assist where he can, but he doesn't want Witch and Light to know that he plotted against them, because it would cost him his job and his home. He also warns that he'll see no harm come to his bosses; they might be flawed, but without them, the carnival will fall apart.

Over the course of the conversation, Burly shares the following additional pieces of information:

- "The Witchlight Monarch is chosen by **Mister Light**'s *Witchlight vane*. Witch and Light have no control over who the monarch will be, but it's always the guest who has contributed the most to the happiness of the carnival. The monarch is also given a charm that lets them fly."
- "**Mister Witch**'s *Witchlight watch* is attached to his waistcoat by a chain, so whoever tries to steal it needs something to break or unfasten the chain."
- "Dirlagraun, Candlefoot, and Palasha might help you—they're good eggs. But stay away from Thaco—he's untrustworthy."

If the characters suggest stealing the *Witchlight vane* instead of the *Witchlight watch*, Burly asserts that the watch is easier to steal because it's smaller and often tucked in **Mister Witch**'s pocket, whereas **Mister Light** is rarely seen without the vane in hand. Burly concedes, however, that the vane yields almost as much leverage in negotiations with Witch and Light, though he has no plan for stealing the vane.

#### The Heist
See "Timed Events" later in the chapter for details of the coronation. It's up to the characters to come up with a plan to get close enough to **Mister Witch** to steal his pocket watch. Any allies they've gained go along with their schemes but won't harm the carnival owners or other members of the carnival staff.

**Mister Witch** keeps the watch in his waistcoat pocket, fastened to the garment with a chain. As an action, a character can attempt to steal the timepiece with a DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. This check is made with advantage if Witch is distracted during the attempt. A character needs thieves' tools, a dagger, or a pair of scissors to snip or detach the chain securing the watch.

If the characters rob **Mister Witch** of his timepiece, he and Light are desperate to get it back. They'd prefer not to cause a scene in front of the guests and promise to show the characters the way to Prismeer once the watch is returned. Witch and Light are true to their word (see "Through the Looking Glass" at the end of the chapter).

### Catching Kettlesteam
**Kettlesteam** (see the accompanying stat block) snoops around the carnival under the cover of a *disguise self* spell, looking to cause trouble. The kenku has stolen the voice of a human mime named Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions" earlier in the chapter). While this prize remains in her possession, Kettlesteam can speak clearly in Candlefoot's soft, silky voice.

If Kettlesteam has not already been caught, a character who spends 1 hour searching for the disguised kenku can, with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check, see through her disguise while moving through crowds and paying close attention to suspicious-looking folks. If discovered, Kettlesteam tries to flee from the main thoroughfare, using tents and other carnival features to break line of sight to her. She's willing to cautiously parley with characters who claim they are investigating the carnival for their own reasons.

*Appendix D* contains additional roleplaying notes for Kettlesteam.

![[033-637677441694763205.png|right|300]]

#### Talking with Kettlesteam
If the characters corner her, Kettlesteam tells her story in the voice she stole from Candlefoot:

- Many years ago, she made a fey pact with Zybilna, the archfey who rules the Feywild domain of Prismeer. Recently, Kettlesteam has become convinced something is amiss with her patron. As a warlock, she senses that Zybilna is no longer in touch with her—a very disconcerting thought!
- Kettlesteam wants to question the carnival's owners about Prismeer, but they keep giving her the cold shoulder. She's sure they know more than they're letting on.
- During her last visit, Kettlesteam overheard Witch and Light talking in their wagon. She repeats the conversation, using her Mimicry trait to imitate Light's agitated voice ("Someone is going to find out about this! They'll shut us down!") followed by Witch's calm yet firm reply ("We agreed to this pact. Our hands were forced but our eyes were open. We let the Hourglass Coven take what it wants, and in return, we stay in business. That is what you want, right?").
- Kettlesteam is causing trouble in the carnival and refuses to stop until Witch and Light divulge what they know about Zybilna and Prismeer.
- Due to the terms of her fey pact, Kettlesteam can't enter Prismeer. She urges the characters to find out what has happened to Zybilna.

If one or more characters are working for Madryck (see the "Warlock's Quest" adventure hook in the *introduction*) and the characters mention Madryck by name, the kenku ruffles her feathers and lets out a squawk, admitting that she and Madryck are rivals who happen to share the same patron (Zybilna). Each thinks the other is untrustworthy.

If questioned about the theft of Candlefoot's voice, Kettlesteam produces a corn husk doll with a thorny stem tied around its neck. The doll represents Candlefoot, and untying the stem restores the mime's lost voice. Any character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check can convince Kettlesteam to part with the doll.

#### Kettlesteam's Aid
Characters who befriend Kettlesteam earn a valuable ally in the carnival. She can offer advice, or even help the characters steal **Mister Witch**'s watch (see "Burly's Plan" earlier in the chapter).

If the characters miss the opportunity to meet with **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**, Kettlesteam comes up with a plan similar to Burly's: she encourages the characters to steal **Mister Light**'s *Witchlight vane* and use it as leverage to blackmail the carnival owners into showing them the way to Prismeer. How the characters acquire the vane is up to them, but Kettlesteam is happy to help.

#### Development
If the characters reunite Candlefoot with his voice, note this accomplishment on the *Story Tracker*. The grateful Candlefoot gives the characters an acting lesson at the earliest opportunity, giving them a talent that might prove useful in *chapter 4* (see the "Fey Beacons" section).

Once he regains his voice, Candlefoot seeks out Palasha and proposes marriage to her. Reuniting the couple causes the carnival's mood to rise by 2 steps (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter). From that point on, Palasha and Candlefoot treat the characters as trusted allies, which could prove useful during the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch, as they both have roles to play in the coronation.

### Timed Events
The following events occur at specific times throughout the evening.

#### Hour 1: Welcome Gifts
Shortly after the carnival opens for business, read:

>>A twelve-foot-tall walking tree garlanded in golden ribbons marches down the thoroughfare. Emerald clouds swirl above the tree and rain down golden, spinning sycamore seeds. Fairgoers try to catch the seeds before they hit the ground. As the seeds gently fall, a chatty squirrel scampers along the boughs of the tree, handing dandelions to select passersby.
>>

The tree is Northwind, a **treant sapling** (see its stat block earlier in the chapter), and the squirrel is its trusty companion, Red (see "Dragonfly Rides" earlier in the chapter). As Northwind encourages onlookers to catch the falling seeds before they touch the ground, Red hands the characters one dandelion apiece and encourages each of them to make a wish and then blow the dandelion's seeds into the air.

***Sycamore Seeds.*** A creature can attempt to catch a falling sycamore seed before it touches the ground, doing so with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Any creature that catches a seed before it touches the ground receives a gift, determined by rolling a d8 and consulting the Welcome Gifts table. A creature that receives one of these gifts can't gain another one for 24 hours.

***Dandelion Seeds.*** A character can make a wish while blowing their dandelion's seeds into the air. The player should secretly write down their character's wish on a piece of paper; collect these notes and keep them somewhere safe. On the Story Tracker, jot down the names of the characters who make wishes. These wishes become relevant in *chapter 4* (see "Wish Stones" in the "Brigganock Mine" section).

##### Welcome Gifts
| d8 | Gift |
|:---:|---|
| 1–3 | The creature gains the following personality trait until dawn: "I am easily amused." Any conflicting character trait is suppressed in the meantime. |
| 4 | The creature gains a die, a d4, which it can add to one ability check it makes before the next dawn. |
| 5–7 | The seed turns into a gold piece. |
| 8 | The creature gains a die, a d8, which it can add to one ability check it makes before the next dawn. |

#### Hour 4: Big Top Extravaganza
Spectators file into the Big Top and fill the rows of seats. If the characters join them, read:

>>The lights dim and a hush falls over the crowd. A second later, a spotlight illuminates a lithe, elven figure sitting in a silver hoop, suspended above the center ring by silk ropes. The elf wears a dazzling suit of diamond-pane mirrors and a pair of butterfly wings. His scepter is topped with a spinning vane.
>>
>>"Welcome, one and all, to this evening's extravaganza! I am **Mister Light**. Prepare to be delighted!"
>>

The extravaganza involves several of the carnival's star performers and attractions, with **Mister Light** serving as ringmaster. Over the course of an hour, Burly the bugbear performs feats of strength, Palasha the mermaid serenades the audience from a clamshell bathing pool, Candlefoot the mime plays silent games with audience members, and faerie dragons with bright streamers tied to their tails perform dazzling acts of synchronized flying as a troupe of acrobats, clowns, and fire-breathers parade about. If the characters attempt to disrupt the show, **Mister Light** deflects their interruptions with banter and maintains a jovial demeanor. Persistent heckling lowers the carnival's mood by 1 step (see "Tracking Mood" earlier in the chapter).

Near the end of the show, **Mister Light** asks if any guests would like to perform their own acts for the crowd. Any character who accepts the offer can woo spectators with a DC 14 Charisma (Performance) check, raising the carnival's mood by 1 step on a success. If multiple characters choose to perform together, make it a group check instead, but raise the carnival's mood by 3 steps if the group check succeeds. A character can improve the carnival's mood only once during this extravaganza.

At the end of the show, Burly invites any characters who took to the stage and impressed the crowd to meet with **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** (see "Meeting Witch and Light" earlier in the chapter).

#### Hour 8: Crowning the Witchlight Monarch
Most of the carnival's stars have a part to play in the coronation, which celebrates the joyous zeal of a single guest. The event plays out as follows:

- As spectators take their seats in the Big Top, Dirlagraun the displacer beast escorts **Mister Witch** from his wagon to the coronation, leaving Thaco the clown behind to guard the Staff Area.
- **Mister Witch** and Dirlagraun stand on the sidelines next to Candlefoot as **Mister Light** gives an opening speech and the monarch is selected (see "Selecting a Monarch" below). Candlefoot holds the hatbox containing the monarch's crown.
- **Mister Witch** removes the crown of golden butterflies from the hatbox and places it on the monarch's head; **Mister Light** knights the monarch with the *Witchlight vane*. Happy clowns shower all three in glitter.
- Witch and Light escort the monarch on a circuit of the stage while Palasha the mermaid sings a joyous song and pixies flutter all around her.
- When Palasha's song concludes, **Mister Light** leads the monarch on a parade through the carnival, with the other guests following as Burly the bugbear sets off fireworks. Meanwhile, Dirlagraun escorts **Mister Witch** back to his wagon.

***Selecting a Monarch.*** **Mister Light**'s *Witchlight vane* selects the monarch from the carnival's guests, spinning a thread of golden light that winds its way to the chosen reveler. If the mood of the carnival is positive, choose the character who improved the carnival's mood the most, or ask the players to agree on which of their characters should be crowned. If it's not appropriate for any of the characters to be crowned monarch, then a jubilant halfling bedecked in flowers is selected from the crowd. **Mister Light** exudes cheerfulness and follows through with the ceremony regardless of who is chosen.

At the end of the celebration, as the carnival begins to wind down, the ceremonial crown teleports back into its hatbox. Candlefoot returns the hatbox to the Staff Area, handing it off to Thaco the clown, who stashes it in the wagon belonging to **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**.

***Tumblestrum's Intervention.*** If the characters haven't found a way to Prismeer by the end of the evening, Ellywick Tumblestrum (see "Feasting Orchard" earlier in the chapter) comes to their aid. The gnome bard appears next to the characters, exclaiming that it's "high time you folks were elsewhere," and leads them quickly to the Hall of Illusions. She ushers them inside and whispers the following incantation to them: "Hither, thither, here and there; wander yonder, show me where." Using the incantation, the characters can travel to Prismeer (see "Through the Looking Glass" below). If they are being chased, Tumblestrum distracts pursuers with a song before disappearing as mysteriously as she appeared.

#### Development
The Witchlight Monarch gains the following charm (see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more information) and instantly becomes aware of its benefits:

>***Charm of the Monarch.*** You can sprout a pair of beautiful butterfly wings. As long as you have the wings, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you gain a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour. After you use this charm three times, it vanishes from you.

If one of the characters becomes the Witchlight Monarch, note this fact on the *Story Tracker*. Even after the charm wears off, a character retains the title of Witchlight Monarch forever, and this title bears great weight in Prismeer. Fey creatures in the domain will not attack a Witchlight Monarch unless the monarch attacks them first. Moreover, Fey creatures in Prismeer treat a Witchlight Monarch with great reverence, addressing the character as "Your Majesty" or "Your Highness." The characters don't become aware of these benefits until they arrive in Prismeer and interact with its inhabitants.

![[034-01-018.the-feywild-awaits.png|right|300]]

### Through the Looking Glass
If the characters gain leverage over **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**, either by stealing the *Witchlight watch* or through some other scheme, the carnival owners lead them to the Hall of Illusions and march them inside:

>>As Witch and Light move through the Hall of Illusions, their reflections in the mirrors show them as gloomy shadar-kai children, with your own youthful reflections following behind. Soon, they call you to a halt. The mirrors now reflect everyone's true age.
>>
>>**Mister Witch** addresses you in a hushed tone. "Everything you seek and more lies beyond this mirror. If you mean to step through, then stand in front of the glass and repeat this rhyme: Hither, thither, here and there; wander yonder, show me where."
>>

Witch and Light won't mention the Hourglass Coven or the splintering of Prismeer, but they share the following information if pressed:

- The land beyond the mirrors is called Prismeer, wherein dwells the carnival's secret patron, the archfey Zybilna.
- Anyone who sneaks into the carnival without a ticket is robbed of something precious. Whatever is stolen always finds its way to Prismeer.
- The mirror is a one-way portal. Once they arrive in Prismeer, the characters must find their own way back to their world.

#### Stepping Through
When a character recites Witch's rhyme while standing in front of their present-day reflection in the Hall of Illusions, read:

>>Mist swirls in the mirror, blotting out your reflection.
>>

Any creature that touches the surface of the misty mirror is pulled through it and deposited in Hither, one of Prismeer's three splinter-realms (described in chapter 2). If a character tries to take either the *Witchlight watch* or the *Witchlight vane* through the mirror, the item drops to the floor as the character crosses the threshold. Neither item can be taken to Prismeer.

If **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** are both present, they wait until only one character remains and then impart the following information to that character:

>>*Witch*: "Mind the Rule of Three: future, present, past."
>>
>>*Light*: "Find the alicorn and free the dormant queen at last."
>>

Proceed with *chapter 2* once the characters pass through the magic mirror.
---
# Hither
When the domain of Prismeer was divided among the hags of the Hourglass Coven, **Bavlorna Blightstraw** transformed her portion into the swamp now known as Hither. It is a foreboding place, one where daylight never fully penetrates the dank mist that hangs over the land, and where cruel and mischievous bandits prey upon stranded and lost travelers. Hither is the realm of the present, where life and decay walk hand in hand, and where creatures live in the moment, not concerned with history or repercussions.

Deep in Hither is Downfall, a shantytown built around an ancient well. Bullywugs occupy this settlement, which surrounds Bavlorna's ghastly cottage.

![[035-02-001.chapter-splash.jpg|right|300]]

## Running This Chapter
When the characters step through the magic mirror in the Witchlight Carnival's Hall of Illusions, they arrive in Hither.

Before your first game session in this place, follow these steps to make the players' experience as entertaining as possible:

- Hither is ruled by a hag named **Bavlorna Blightstraw**, also known as Slack-jawed Lorna. Read her description and skim her stat block in appendix B.
- Read this chapter in its entirety.
- Look over the map of Hither. Locations marked on the map are described later in the chapter.

### Lost Things in Hither
If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook, check the *Story Tracker* to see if **Bavlorna Blightstraw** has anything the characters want to reclaim. When the characters enter Hither, anyone who had something stolen by Bavlorna gets the nagging sensation that it is somewhere in this realm, though the character doesn't know where. The feeling fades when the character either regains what was lost or leaves Hither without recovering it. The hag keeps stolen goodies in the mouth of a bronze frog statue in her cottage (see area B19).

When you and the players are ready to run this part of the adventure, begin your narration with the "Arrival in Hither" section and proceed from there.

### Navigating Hither
Using the map of Hither as a reference, describe nearby landmarks that the characters can see and allow the players to choose their own destinations. Named locations on the map are described later in the chapter.

After stepping through the mirror in the Witchlight Carnival, the characters appear atop a broken bridge called the Queen's Way, which overlooks Hither's vast swamp. After descending to ground level, they witness a balloon crash and encounter a band of singing brigands.

Characters who search for the crashed balloon find it hanging from the top of a leaning tower. Inside the balloon's basket is a caged faerie dragon knight named **Sir Talavar**, who begs for the characters' aid. To free **Sir Talavar** from his magic cage, the characters might have to travel to Telemy Hill in search of a goblin who has the key to the cage. In the course of their travels, they could find themselves on the Brigands' Tollway, being bedeviled by a notorious brigand named **Agdon Longscarf**.

As the characters navigate the swamp, they might have one or more random encounters, as described in the "Random Encounters in Hither" section.

#### Guide from Hither to Thither
If the characters need a guide to Thither, they can find one in Downfall—home of **Bavlorna Blightstraw** and the bullywugs of the Soggy Court. This guide is an animated scarecrow named Clapperclaw, who can guide characters from Hither to Thither and back to Hither. Clapperclaw is encountered in *area D5*, but you can move the scarecrow elsewhere if the characters don't visit that location.

## Prismeer Overview
Prismeer was a single Feywild domain until the Hourglass Coven broke it into three splinter-realms: Hither (a vast swamp), Thither (an ancient forest), and Yon (a stormy, mountainous landscape). The only way to restore Prismeer to its former state is to free the archfey Zybilna, who is frozen in time and trapped in her palace, which sits at the point where Hither, Thither, and Yon used to be connected.

General information about Prismeer is presented in this chapter, since Hither is where the characters take their first steps in this fractured Feywild domain.

![[036-map-2.1.jpg|right|300]]

### A Domain Divided
The poster map of Prismeer shows the Feywild domain divided into four sections: the splinter-realms of Hither, Thither, and Yon, and the Palace of Heart's Desire. These fragments are partitioned off from one another and the rest of the Feywild by walls of shimmering, silvery mist.

The hags of the Hourglass Coven and their minions can travel freely between Hither, Thither, Yon, and the Palace of Heart's Desire simply by walking into or flying over the border mist, whereupon they are instantly transported to the border of whichever part of Prismeer contains their intended destination. Most other creatures—including the characters—are forbidden from leaving one part of Prismeer and entering another. Upon reaching the edge of Hither, Thither, Yon, or the palace, they find all paths forward blocked by the mist, which disorients them and sends them back the way they came. Those who try to fly above the mist never get where they intend to go, their destination always appearing to be miles away.

The outer borders of Prismeer are blocked by similar walls of mist through which no creature can pass without Zybilna's consent (which she can't give while frozen in time). Even the hags of the Hourglass Coven are bound by this restriction; they must use *plane shift* spells to leave Prismeer or reenter it. Other creatures capable of casting the spell can do the same.

### Friendly Guides
In each of Prismeer's splinter-realms, the characters can find a guide—a disloyal minion of the Hourglass Coven—who is willing and able to lead them from one splinter-realm to another. While in the company of one or more of these guides, the characters can move through the mist separating Prismeer's splinter-realms without being turned back. These guides are as follows:

- Clapperclaw, a child-sized scarecrow, lives in Hither and can safely guide creatures from Hither to Thither or vice versa. The characters find Clapperclaw in Downfall (described later in this chapter).
- Squirt, an animated oilcan, dwells in Thither and can safely guide creatures from Thither to Yon or vice versa. Squirt is described in chapter 3.
- Amidor, a swashbuckling dandelion, inhabits Yon and can safely guide creatures from Yon to Hither or vice versa. It also knows a route to the Palace of Heart's Desire. See chapter 4 for more information about this guide.

The Palace of Heart's Desire can be glimpsed through veils of mist from certain vantage points in all three of Prismeer's splinter-realms. To get to Zybilna's palace, the characters must secure the help of **Amidor the dandelion** or other creatures in Prismeer. To leave Prismeer entirely, they need the help of Zybilna herself, as discussed in *chapter 5*.

### Rules of Conduct
Although Zybilna is indisposed, three of the rules she put into place when she created her Feywild domain continue to hold weight: the rule of hospitality, the rule of ownership, and the rule of reciprocity. These three rules are common knowledge in Prismeer, and both natives and visitors would do well to abide by them:

- **Rule of Hospitality** When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger enters your home, you are expected to be gracious and accommodating to them until such time as they prove, by their words or actions, undeserving of such hospitality.
- **Rule of Ownership** You must not steal from a friend, an enemy, or a stranger. To take something that doesn't belong to you without the rightful owner's permission is a crime and an unforgivable breach of etiquette.
- **Rule of Reciprocity** When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger offers you a gift, you are obliged to accept it and offer something of comparable value (be it a gift or a service) in return. Such reciprocation need not happen immediately.

When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, few of her subjects dared to violate her rules. Those who did often disappeared without a trace. Now, with the Hourglass Coven in charge, the rules remain in force, though the circumstances are different. The hags believe strongly in hospitality and reciprocity, but they have a self-centered view of ownership—each claims ownership of everything in her realm. (For example, **Bavlorna Blightstraw** considers herself the owner of Hither and everything in it.)

Also, the hags are far less inclined to punish those who break the rules than Zybilna was, and it's not even clear to other residents of Prismeer when a rule has been broken. For example, brigands are able to take what they want from other folk without paying for it, and nothing bad seems to happen to them as a result, but that fact alone is not enough to encourage most others to likewise break the rules—for all they know, the brigands might be acting in the hags' interests.

If Zybilna were to return to power, strict enforcement of the rules would resume in a heartbeat, and brigands would be wise to take their propensity for malfeasance elsewhere.

### Children of Prismeer
In this chapter and in later chapters, the characters might encounter children who were lured to Prismeer from the Witchlight Carnival or who stumbled into Zybilna's domain by other means. These children have been stuck in Prismeer long enough to forget about the worlds they came from, yet they haven't aged much at all.

Zybilna's magic protects all children in Prismeer (but not creatures disguised as children). The hags of the Hourglass Coven are aware of this magic and unable to dispel it. Any child in Prismeer who would take damage as a consequence of another creature's actions vanishes in a burst of multicolored light and is spirited away to a safe corner of Prismeer, unharmed and unreachable from the domain's splinter-realms or the palace, until Zybilna wills the child to return to her. Children sequestered in this fashion are beyond the reach of everyone else and can't be located or scried upon using magic.

### Transforming the Domain
Prismeer, like other Feywild domains, is shaped by the emotions of the creatures that inhabit it. Even creatures of little consequence can transform the domain in minor ways as long as no other, more powerful force is exerting its influence. For example, flowers might wilt in the presence of a goblin who is terribly unhappy. Similarly, a satyr's laughter might cause a smile to appear on the trunk of an inanimate tree nearby. A more powerful creature, such as a hag, can reshape a larger portion of the domain to reflect their emotional state. An archfey is so attuned to the Feywild that their emotions can suffuse an entire domain, overriding the emotional influence of all other creatures in it. From that standpoint, Zybilna's dormancy enables other creatures to affect Prismeer more than they could if she were still active.

As the characters make their way across the splintered realms of Prismeer, any emotional outburst or change in mood they exhibit might be accompanied by a minor reaction in the environment, which you can determine by choosing an entry that you like from the Domain Transformation table or by rolling on the table to determine a random result. Not every emotion felt in Prismeer is worthy of a roll on the table; you can save these effects for occasions when emotions are running high, to remind your players that the Feywild is not like the Material Plane. Because these effects have no impact on the story, you can forgo using the table if you want.

If Zybilna is released from her temporal stasis, the ability of other creatures to alter her domain is suppressed until she is incapacitated, killed, or no longer in Prismeer.

##### Domain Transformation
| d8 | Reaction to a Positive Emotion | Reaction to a Negative Emotion |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | Birds sing or crickets chirp merrily nearby. | Wood creaks and groans nearby. |
| 2 | Flowers bloom or tasty mushrooms sprout nearby. | Ugly weeds or thorny, flowerless vines sprout nearby. |
| 3 | Fireflies gather and dance nearby. | Flies pester you. |
| 4 | An inanimate object nearby appears to smile. | An inanimate object nearby appears to frown. |
| 5 | Clouds shaped like little hearts appear in the sky above you. | A cloud above you takes the form of an old woman's sad face. |
| 6 | A gentle breeze carries a sweet scent. | A chill wind carries a rotten stench. |
| 7 | The croak of a nearby **frog** sounds an awful lot like "I love you." | A nearby **raven** mocks you by imitating the sound of a baby crying. |
| 8 | You find a golden acorn. If you bury it in the ground, an **awakened shrub** that is friendly toward you instantly sprouts from the ground in that spot. | You find a golden acorn. If you bury it in the ground, a **twig blight** that is hostile toward you instantly sprouts from the ground in that spot. |

### Death in Prismeer
Whenever a creature—including a player character—dies in Prismeer, its death has a chance of triggering one of several magical effects put in place by Zybilna. The effect is determined by rolling a d8 and referring to the Death Effects table.

##### Death Effects
| d8 | Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The creature's corpse turns to stone. |
| 2 | The creature's corpse decays at an accelerated rate, becoming nothing but bones after 1 minute. |
| 3–6 | No additional effect. |
| 7 | The creature's corpse is preserved for 10 days, as though affected by a *gentle repose* spell. While preserved in this way, the corpse is encased in an opalescent film like the skin of a bubble. Any further damage to the corpse breaks the spell. |
| 8 | The creature instantly returns to life with 1 hit point, as though affected by a *revivify* spell. |

### Foraging in Prismeer
Any character who spends at least 1 hour searching for drinkable water in Prismeer's wilderness can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. If the check succeeds, the character finds a natural spring that can provide as much fresh water as the party can carry.

Foraging for food is even easier. Any character who spends at least 1 hour foraging can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. On a success, the character finds enough food to feed the party for 1 day. A character who exceeds the DC by 10 or more also finds one or more edible Feywild treats, determined by rolling once on the Feywild Treats table.

##### Feywild Treats
| d8 | Treats |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Three gingerbread cookies shaped like elves and stacked on a wooden plate |
| 2 | A minty, three-leaf clover (for the next 8 hours, any creature that eats a leaf plucked from the clover can communicate telepathically with another creature up to 100 feet away that has eaten a similar clover leaf) |
| 3 | A delicious orange flower that whispers, "Eat me" (the flower's head is tart, while its stem is sweet) |
| 4 | A white and gray eldercap mushroom (any creature that eats more than half of the mushroom has its appearance magically changed so that it looks like an aged version of itself for the next 24 hours) |
| 5 | A wisp of sweet, candied mist (similar in consistency and taste to cotton candy) |
| 6 | A brilliantly colored sunrise flower, which, when plucked, sheds light like a lantern for 8 hours (it also tastes like spicy honey) |
| 7 | A small, flaky meat pie wrapped in a colorful cloth (the pie is hearty and delicious) |
| 8 | A gourd shaped like a plump little dragon (any creature that eats more than half of the gourd's innards gains 2d4 + 2 temporary hit points) |

## Features of Hither
The portion of Prismeer known as Hither is an enormous swamp containing huge tangles of mangrove roots, expanses of thick marsh, and mysterious sites half-sunk in the muck. Weird and haunting creatures call Hither home, and the land is dotted with old wells that belch out and slurp up the sludgy water that saturates the land. At its heart, the hag **Bavlorna Blightstraw** makes her lair in Downfall.

![[038-map-2.2-hither-player.jpg|right|300]]
### Fluctuating Swamp Waters
Hither's fetid waters rise and fall sporadically. In minutes, neck-deep murk might recede to reveal a soggy landscape of squelching mud and skeletal mangrove roots, but only until the waters ooze back into the swamp to fill it once again in an hour or three. The ebb and flow have a supernatural origin: Hither is dotted with ancient stone wells, known as o'-wells, which drink up and spew out the swamp water (see "O'-wells" below for more information).

The denizens of Hither are accustomed to the ever-changing water level, but newcomers might find it alarming at first and then perhaps annoying. The water level changes whenever you want it to, taking 1d10 minutes to go from high to low or vice versa.

#### High Water Features
- **Depth** The water's depth is 5 feet. Creatures that don't have a swimming speed move at half speed through the water.
- **Visibility** Visibility underwater is 10 feet.

#### Low Water Features
- **Difficult Terrain** The sticky mud of the exposed swamp bottom is *difficult terrain*.
- **Mud Pits** Characters marching across the swamp might blunder into swampy terrain that contains a pit of sucking mud. Whenever you see fit to use this hazard, have the characters make a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) group check. If the group check is successful, the characters spot and avoid the hazard. On a failed check, the character who had the lowest check result sinks into a pit of sucking mud, which is 10 feet deep (use the *quicksand rules* in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

### O'-wells
These magic wells are scattered throughout Hither. Their builders and their original purpose have been long forgotten. In the days when Zybilna ruled over her domain, the wells served as gathering places where Fey creatures bartered and shared gossip.

When the Hourglass Coven took over, Bavlorna corrupted the wells with her magic so that vile water burbled up to saturate Hither and transform it into a festering swamp. Today, the wells fluctuate between spewing out the foul water and drinking it back in, such that the landscape changes from a flooded marsh to a muddy morass at irregular intervals.

Each well is ringed by hewn stone, is 10 feet in diameter, and rises 3d10 feet above ground level. Each well is inhabited by 1d4 **will-o'-wisps** that float up to greet new arrivals. These will-o'-wisps are chaotic good instead of evil. They are the spirits of creatures that drowned when Bavlorna flooded their realm. Consequently, they both fear and shun the hag. The will-o'-wisps ask the characters to identify themselves and state their intentions. If the characters express interest in undoing the damage wrought by Bavlorna, the will-o'-wisps are cheerful at the prospect of Bavlorna's ruin. They are unable to move more than a few hundred yards from their well, but they're eager to help strangers who are willing and able to avenge them. These will-o'-wisps have the following additional action option, which they use to grant boons to those who promise to oppose Bavlorna:

>***Magic Boon (Recharges after a Long Rest).*** The will-o'-wisp grants a boon to one creature it can see within 5 feet of it that isn't an Undead. The boon's recipient gains a d4 and can, at any time within the next 24 hours, roll this die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by it. No creature can have more than one of these magic boons at a time.

## Arrival in Hither
When the characters first arrive in Hither, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>You stand at the edge of a raised and broken causeway under a hazy, twilit sky. The causeway, which is built from pale stones that glow faintly from within, towers over the surrounding landscape, but large sections of it have crumbled away. The parts that remain in place are separated by large gaps where portions have collapsed.
>>
>>A fog-shrouded swamp spreads out below you in all directions, and up from its murk wafts the smell of rotting plants. Also rising from the swamp is the music of nature—a discordant symphony of croaking frogs and singing birds.
>>

The characters are on an isolated section of the Queen's Way (shown on the accompanying *map of Hither*), which once was an elevated highway leading to and from the Palace of Heart's Desire. Since Zybilna became frozen in time, the Queen's Way has gradually fallen apart so that only sections of it now remain standing.

The highway is 20 feet wide and 100 feet above the swamp. The section supporting the characters is west of Slanty Tower on the map. Large, colorful shelf mushrooms cling to the lower half of each support pillar. The marshland surrounding the pillars is hidden under a 10-foot-thick blanket of fog that heavily obscures all creatures inside it.

Handholds and footholds carved into each pillar lead down to the mushrooms. Characters can use the handholds, footholds, and shelf mushrooms to descend a pillar safely, or they can accomplish the same feat using climbing gear (no ability checks required in either case). *Feather fall*, *spider climb*, and similar spells also enable characters to reach the ground safely. Any character who tries to climb a pillar without using handholds, footholds, climbing gear, or magic must succeed on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check or fall, taking damage as normal.

### Balloon Crash
Before the characters descend from their perch on the Queen's Way, the one with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices something:

>>In the distant sky, you spot a great balloon made of patchwork material. It spins out of control as though punctured, causing the wicker basket that hangs from it to swing wildly. The balloon plunges out of sight, disappearing into the fog approximately a mile away.
>>

The doomed balloon crashes into Slanty Tower, which the characters can't see through the fog and haze. See "The Calamitous Flight of Sir Talavar and Wigglewog" later in the chapter for a description of the balloon and its passengers.

### Reaching the Bottom
The swamp beneath the Queen's Way is presently at a low water level (see "Fluctuating Swamp Waters" earlier in the chapter). As the last character reaches the marshy ground, a giant crane (use the **pteranodon** stat block) previously hidden by the fog emerges and takes flight. The giant crane poses no threat, but its sudden movement alerts a band of brigands lurking nearby.

After the giant crane flies off, read the following boxed text aloud:

>>Sticky mud squelches beneath your feet. Tangled mangroves grow out of pools of rippling water, half hidden by the thick fog, and purple mushrooms cling to rotting logs and stumps scattered throughout the marsh. Crickets that glow like fireflies chirp serenely before they're snatched out of the air by the tongues of hungry frogs.
>>
>>Coming from one direction are several voices joined in a marching song. The singing grows louder as six bipedal rabbits wearing clothing emerge from the fog. Two of them tug at the reins of a giant snail, and the others carry clubs and slings.
>>

The singing harefolk are six **harengon brigands** (see *appendix C*) who delight in thievery but avoid killing. Their marching song is dedicated to their notorious captain, **Agdon Longscarf**, whom the characters might encounter later in the chapter. The harengons' song is as follows:

>*With sticks and stones, we'll break your nose;*
>
>*We'll beat you blind and steal your clothes.*
>
>*But none among us can compare*
>
>*To one wily, swift, and stand-up hare—*
>
>*Scarf that's glorious, thief notorious,*
>
>*His deeds are truly meritorious!With a wink and a grin, he'll show his cunning;*
>
>*A flash of his scarf, he'll take off running.*
>
>*Quick as a bolt, his long scarf trailing,*
>
>*Gasping, grasping, you'll end up flailing.*
>
>*You'll pout, you'll moan, you'll huff, you'll sneer;*
>
>*Thanks to Agdon Longscarf, brigand prince of Prismeer*!
>

Four of the brigands have their weapons drawn, and the other two browbeat their pack animal, a **giant snail** (see *appendix C*). The snail is hostile toward its keepers and indifferent toward other creatures. Characters who participated in the Witchlight Carnival's snail race (see chapter 1) have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made to win over the giant snail, turning it into a friendly ally.

#### Roleplaying the Brigands
If the characters don't attack immediately, one of the brigands with weapons drawn signals the others to stop singing with a wave of her hand. She introduces herself as Jebbek, and she says to the characters, "This is a robbery. If you resist, we'll beat you black and blue."

Jebbek has no interest in treasure. She demands that each character surrender the feeling of delight they remember from when they were given the best gift they ever received. Jebbek produces a stoppered gourd that can hold these memories. The stopper sports a golden knob, and any character who voluntarily touches the knob while Jebbek is holding the gourd loses the memory Jebbek wants to steal, as it is siphoned away and trapped in the gourd. (Give each player a minute or so to think about what the character's memory could be and then to note it on their character sheet, as a matter of record.) Removing the stopper releases all memories trapped inside the gourd, whereupon they return to their original owners.

If all the characters comply, the harengons leave with the gourd full of happy memories, saying that "**Agdon Longscarf** is much obliged." If one or more characters refuse to give up their cherished memories, the brigands threaten the characters with a beating. At this time, the characters can make a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) group check. If the group check succeeds, the brigands are cowed by the characters' resolve and retreat into the swamp rather than risk getting whomped by the party. On a failed check, the harengons try to beat the characters unconscious and steal their weapons, though they flee if the fight turns against them.

Jebbek's gourd was a gift to **Agdon Longscarf** from **Bavlorna Blightstraw**. Although any creature can plug or unplug the gourd's stopper, only Agdon or another creature he designates (in this case, Jebbek) can use the gourd to trap memories.

### Random Encounters in Hither
Use random encounters to bring the swamp to life or to present the characters with more opportunities to interact with the setting. You can also use random encounters to convey information that the players might have missed earlier in the story.

A random encounter occurs whenever you want one to. To determine what the characters find, roll a d8 and consult the Random Encounters in Hither table. If you roll on the table, get the same result as a previous roll, and don't like the repetition, choose a different encounter that you think would be fun.

##### Random Encounters in Hither
| d8 | Encounter |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Abandoned raft |
| 2 | Gushing o'-well |
| 3 | Inn at the End of the Road |
| 4 | Marsh gas |
| 5 | Mud mephits |
| 6 | Stilt walkers |
| 7 | Stream of visions |
| 8 | Waterlogged battlefield |

#### Abandoned Raft
The characters find an abandoned, 8-foot-square wooden raft that can support up to 1,200 pounds. The characters need a 10-foot pole or similar tool to guide the raft across the water. When the water level of the swamp is at its lowest, the raft gets stuck in the mud and won't budge unless it is carried or dragged. It weighs 300 pounds.

#### Gushing O'-well
The characters hear the rush of water in the distance. If they investigate, they come to an o'-well that is 10 feet tall and 5 feet in diameter. A steady geyser of water shoots from the well, rising to a height of 30 feet above the well. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher see 1d4 Feywild trinkets bobbing in the water at the top of the geyser. (Roll on the Feywild Trinkets table in the introduction to determine each one in turn.) For each trinket, one invisible **will-o'-wisp** hovers within 5 feet of the geyser.

The geyser is powerful enough to lift up to 300 pounds into the air, and the flow of water can be stopped if the well is covered by something weighing more than 300 pounds. If the water is prevented from erupting, anything being lifted by the geyser plummets to the ground within 5 feet of the base of the well.

The will-o'-wisps are the spirits of creatures who owned the trinkets in life. If a character tries to take one or more of the trinkets, the will-o'-wisps turn visible, accuse the character of being a dishonorable thief, and insist that the stolen items be returned to the well at once. The will-o'-wisps will also accept a different trinket as payment for one that was stolen. They attack if the character fails to return the stolen trinkets or provide worthy substitutes.

![[039-02-002.the-inn.png|right|300]]

#### Inn at the End of the Road
The Inn at the End of the Road is the only inn in Hither. It crawls through the swamp on fleshy legs and has a walking speed of 30 feet. Its movement is not reduced by swampy terrain or water up to 10 feet deep. It crosses the characters' path as they make their way through the swamp. Every mile, the inn stops for 10 minutes and lowers itself so that guests can enter or exit without risking injury.

The inn follows an unpredictable course through the swamp. When Prismeer was whole, the inn could travel anywhere in Zybilna's domain. Now that Prismeer is splintered, the inn can't leave Hither.

The inn is a squat, three-story structure with a slate-shingled roof and worm-eaten wood walls. Dozens of tiny orbs of pale light buzz about the exterior like flies. The structure rocks and heaves while in motion, but these movements cannot be perceived from inside the inn.

As the inn passes by the characters, they catch the smell of hearty stew wafting from its open windows and see smoke rising in cottony puffs from its stone chimney.

For the inn's interior, use the inn map in *appendix C* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

***Innkeeper.*** Tsu Harabax, an elderly female human **druid** (neutral), has been running the Inn at the End of the Road by herself since before the Hourglass Coven seized control of Prismeer. She has heard rumors that Zybilna is trapped in her palace, but she doesn't know any details. Tsu would love to see Zybilna restored to power, if only so she can escape the swampy morass of Hither.

Tsu despises Bavlorna. If the characters mention the hag or the Hourglass Coven, the druid spits and mutters, "In Zybilna's time, this inn was the talk of Prismeer." She speaks about Zybilna reverently, though her tone remains morose.

***Staying at the Inn.*** Tsu offers free beds, hot meals, and slices of delicious plum pie to her guests, but the rule of reciprocity dictates that guests repay her kindness (see "Rules of Conduct" earlier in the chapter). If the characters aren't sure what to give her, Tsu says, "Any old trinket will do." If the characters promise to do everything possible to restore Zybilna to power, Tsu considers that recompense enough.

#### Marsh Gas
One of the hazards of Hither is marsh gas, which erupts from iridescent bubbles in the muck. When a bubble touches something edged, such as a twig or a blade of grass, it pops, releasing its gas with a sound of stifled laughter. The gas smells like old cheese.

As the characters cross the swamp, they encounter a field of marsh gas bubbles and must make a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) group check. If the group check is successful, the characters avoid popping any of the bubbles as they wade through the field. On a failed check, a bubble bursts within 10 feet of the character who had the lowest check result, perhaps catching other nearby characters in its area at your discretion.

Anyone within 10 feet of a bursting bubble must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer the gas's magical effect for 1 hour. Roll on the Marsh Gas table below to determine the effect.

##### Marsh Gas
| d8 | Gas Type |
|:---:|---|
| 1–3 | Babble Gas. Whenever the character speaks, their words come out as gibberish that only the character and others affected by the gas can understand. This effect does not impede the character's ability to cast spells that have verbal components. |
| 4–5 | Hiccupping Gas. The character experiences a most annoying case of the hiccups. To cast a spell that has a verbal component, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check. Also, the character has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. |
| 6–7 | Warting Gas. Hideous warts erupt across the character's body. The warts are unattractive but have no harmful effect. |
| 8 | Bittertongue Gas. A foul taste fills the character's mouth, and everything the character eats or drinks tastes awful. Slugs appear to be the only exception; they taste like ripe cherries. |

#### Mud Mephits
This encounter can occur when the swamp's water level is low. Five **mud mephits** emerge from the muck around the characters and threaten to drag them down into it unless they can guess the mephits' favorite food. The answer, of course, is mud pie. Each character gets one guess. If a character guesses correctly, the mephits cackle maniacally, dive back under the muck, and disappear. If no character guesses correctly, one mephit blurts out the answer as they attack. If two or more mephits are killed in the ensuing fracas, the rest dive into the muck on their next turn and disappear.

#### Stilt Walkers
This encounter takes place in a mist-veiled field of tall swamp grass dotted with clusters of cattails. It begins when the characters hear rustling in the vegetation ahead of them. The sound foreshadows the arrival of six Humanoid creatures on stilts. The stilts allow these creatures to move more easily through the muck and to stay above the water. Their walking speed on stilts is 30 feet, and this movement is not reduced by mud or water.

![[040-02-003.stilt-walker.png|right|300]]

As the stilt walkers advance, the characters recognize them as six **hobgoblins** (lawful neutral) who are wearing patchwork rags and furs (AC 12). Strapped to the back of each stilt walker is a wire cage padded with straw and filled with 1d20 eggs of various sizes and colors. These hobgoblins scour the swamp for the eggs of reptiles and birds, which they either eat or trade to the bullywugs of the Soggy Court (described later in the chapter). The hobgoblins are not violent toward strangers.

If they are left alone, the stilt walkers pass by the characters without so much as a greeting. If the characters try to communicate, the stilt walkers stop and regard them silently for a moment before prompting them to continue. If asked about what they're doing, the stilt walkers explain (in Goblin or, if necessary, in Common) that they are gathering eggs for trading in Downfall. They know in which direction Downfall is located and share that information freely. If the characters attack the stilt walkers, the hobgoblins flee.

#### Stream of Visions
When the water level of the swamp is low, the characters chance upon a 10-foot-wide stream. Unknown to them, the stream flows from Downfall, and any character who looks into the water's reflective surface catches a glimpse of an event transpiring in Downfall at that very moment. Each character who looks might see something different. Roll a d8 and consult the Stream of Visions table to determine what each character sees. Each character can receive only one such vision.

##### Stream of Visions
| d8 | Scene |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A headless, child-sized scarecrow with metal lobster claws for hands tries on some new heads, including an upside-down wooden bucket and a withered head of cabbage. It decides on a large gourd. |
| 2 | A bullywug bedecked in the trappings of a monarch constantly adjusts his ill-fitting crown of lily blossoms while leafing through a large tome spread across his lap. |
| 3 | A hag with toad-like features relaxes in a pool of water while miniature versions of her ladle the water and pour it over her head and shoulders. |
| 4 | A tall, thin figure wearing a pointy black hat and a hooded black cloak climbs a rickety staircase leading up to a large, ramshackle house built on stilts. As the figure approaches the house, their shadow seems to detach from their body, move across the walls of the house, and crawl through an open window. |
| 5 | A satyr whistles to himself as he reclines in a metal cage that dangles off the end of a boom over a lake. |
| 6 | A short, mean-looking old woman wearing a crimson cap, a leather apron, and iron boots uses a cleaver to chop meat in a drab kitchen. |
| 7 | Two merrow swim past each other in murky water. |
| 8 | Rows upon rows of severed bullywug heads, all impaled on spikes, chatter at each other. |

#### Waterlogged Battlefield
The characters come upon a bog that was the site of a battle between elves and fomorians long ago. The area is littered with rusted and broken weapons and armor, along with the bones of the dead. If the characters enter the area, two suits of **animated armor** stand up from the detritus. The suits are clearly of elven design, their helmets shaped like stylized owl heads. Both suits are 20 feet away from the party at the start of the encounter.

Each suit of animated armor mimics the movements of the character closest to it. For example, if the character closest to a suit of armor swings a sword, the armor makes a similar gesture, though it wields no weapons. If the character casts a spell, the suit uses its action to mimic the somatic component of casting a spell on its next turn, though it lacks the ability to cast spells. If one or both suits are attacked, they stop mimicking the characters and defend themselves. Otherwise, they are harmless. They can't leave the battlefield.

A suit becomes inanimate and collapses in a heap if its helmet is removed, if it is reduced to 0 hit points, or if the characters leave the area. Removing a suit's helmet while the armor is animated requires an action and a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

## Locations in Hither
The following encounters are tied to locations marked on the map of Hither. Move these locations as needed to put them in the characters' path, and chalk up any discrepancy with the map to the shifty nature of the Feywild. (The Feywild is known to play tricks on travelers, redirecting them without their knowledge to places they are meant to go. Consequently, the characters might think they're heading toward one part of Hither, only to find themselves arriving somewhere else.) Ideally, you should run all three encounters in the following order before the characters arrive at Downfall:

***Slanty Tower.*** The characters encounter a native of the Feywild but an outsider to Prismeer: **Sir Talavar**, a gallant faerie dragon knight in the service of the Summer Queen. From **Sir Talavar**, the characters learn that Zybilna has been overthrown by the hags of the Hourglass Coven.

***Telemy Hill.*** This encounter serves as a cautionary tale, warning the characters about what becomes of those who are too cavalier about bargains made with a hag. The characters meet a goblin named **Jingle Jangle**, who has an obsession for collecting keys.

***Brigands' Tollway.*** The last of these encounters is with a native of Prismeer who remembers what the domain was like before the Hourglass Coven shattered it. **Agdon Longscarf**, a nefarious bandit leader, can tell the characters how to reach Downfall if they get the better of him.

### Slanty Tower
Characters might travel to Slanty Tower because they headed in that direction after one of them saw the balloon crash shortly after their arrival. Otherwise, they stumble across this location while exploring. The tower tilts severely to one side, kept from falling over by magic. When the characters arrive, read:

>>A crumbling stone tower rises out of the swamp, leaning at such an angle that it threatens to keel over. Black brambles surround the base of the tower and cling to its lower half. Hanging from the crenellations on the lower side of the tower's peak is a large woven basket at the end of a tangle of ropes and tattered fabric. The basket dangles thirty feet above the surface of the swamp.
>>

The leaning tower is 50 feet tall and 20 feet in diameter, with an open door at the bottom on the side opposite where the basket is hanging. The interior of the tower is empty except for a flight of stairs that spirals up the inside wall to an opening in the ceiling that leads to the crenellated roof.

Black brambles cover the ground within 30 feet of the tower, clustering in a dense patch around the open doorway. These brambles are difficult terrain. Each 5-foot-square section has AC 11, 15 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.

#### Plea for Help
As the characters approach the edge of the bramble patch, they hear a whispered voice say in Common, "Psst. You there, I need your help." The whisper comes from the basket that dangles from the top of the tower. If a character responds with anything louder than a whisper, a quick "Shush!" cuts them off. The voice belongs to **Sir Talavar**, who quietly explains his predicament:

>>"I'm in a bit of a bind, as you can observe. I, **Sir Talavar**, as one of the Summer Queen's loyal servants, ask that you free me. You see, I was in the midst of a daring escape from the vile **Bavlorna Blightstraw** when our balloon was set upon by an ill wind and sent plummeting to its current unfortunate location. My pilot, the honorable Wigglewog, did not survive. I've been trapped up here for a while now. Help me. I must tell my queen of the fall of Prismeer!"
>>

If the characters speak in raised voices, **Sir Talavar** shushes them again. If asked why it's important to remain quiet, he says:

>>"Two serpents are asleep in the brambles, just outside the tower door. If you awaken them, they might put the squeeze on you, or worse, devour me."
>>

See "Snakes" below for more information about the two serpents.

The characters can't see **Sir Talavar** from the ground, because he is locked in a birdcage inside the basket that dangles from the tower's peak. Characters on the roof of the tower can look down into the basket and see the corpse of Wigglewog, the balloon's bullywug pilot, who died in the crash. At the bottom of the basket, a silver birdcage lies on its side with **Sir Talavar** inside. He is a **violet faerie dragon** who speaks Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Sylvan. **Sir Talavar** carries a magic sword and has the following additional action option:

>***+1 Tiny Sword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d4 + 6) piercing damage.

A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the birdcage. While **Sir Talavar** is in it, he can't cast spells, but he can use his Euphoria Breath. The cage is locked and can't be destroyed, and its lock can't be picked. A *knock* spell or similar magic opens it, however.

> ##### The Calamitous Flight of Sir Talavar and Wigglewog
>Prior to the events of this adventure, **Sir Talavar**, a noble faerie dragon and emissary of Titania the Summer Queen, traveled to Prismeer to persuade Zybilna to ally with the Seelie Court against its hated enemies, the fomorians. **Sir Talavar** soon discovered that Prismeer had been seized by the hags of the Hourglass Coven. Before he could return with news of their treachery, Bavlorna trapped him in an enchanted silver birdcage that inhibits his magic.
>
>A sympathetic bullywug named Wigglewog stole **Sir Talavar**'s cage and fled with it in one of Bavlorna's balloons. Soon after, the balloon was attacked by a malicious wind (**air elemental**) that sent it careening into an ancient, crumbling tower in the middle of Hither's swamp. The bullywug died in the crash, and **Sir Talavar** (still in his cage) has been stranded since then in the dangling wreckage of the balloon.
>
>A pair of serpents in Bavlorna's service caught up to the balloon, but they are too lazy to climb up the tower to reach it. They have since fallen asleep near the base of the tower.
>

![[041-02-004.sir-talavar.png|right|300]]

#### Roleplaying Sir Talavar
**Sir Talavar** is a knight-errant of the Seelie Court and a loyal vassal of the Summer Queen. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for **Sir Talavar**.

The faerie dragon has an upbeat demeanor and is a strict observer of noble etiquette and courtesies. He knows the way to Downfall and can point characters in the right direction. He can also impart the following useful information:

- **Bavlorna Blightstraw** lives in a spooky cottage on stilts at the heart of Downfall, a bullywug settlement. The bullywugs of Downfall are quite courteous and welcoming, provided one does not offend them.
- Bavlorna has the ability to conjure minions that look like tiny versions of herself.
- Bavlorna has two sisters whom she loathes. Together, the three hags form the Hourglass Coven. Using an artifact called *Iggwilv's Cauldron*, the coven has frozen time in Zybilna's palace, trapping the archfey inside.
- A goblin named **Jingle Jangle** has the key to **Sir Talavar**'s birdcage. She lives atop Telemy Hill, not too far from Slanty Tower.

**Sir Talavar** explains that he must be set free so that he can return to his queen and report the news that Zybilna has been overthrown by the Hourglass Coven.

If the characters are unable to open the birdcage on their own, **Sir Talavar** asks them to get the key from **Jingle Jangle**, offering them his magic sword in return for his release (see "Development" below).

#### Snakes
Outside the tower, about 10 feet from the door, two **giant constrictor snakes** lie together, asleep. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher spot the snakes, which can move through the brambles with no reduction to their speed.

Characters can converse with the snakes using a *speak with animals* spell or similar magic. In the course of any such conversation, a character can try to change the snakes' attitude from hostile to indifferent, doing so with a successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the snakes are made to feel indifferent, they give up their mission and slither away.

#### Development
If the characters free him from his cage, **Sir Talavar** gifts them with his tiny sword, which functions as a *+1 dagger* in the hands of a Small or Medium creature. He then bids them a fond farewell, adding, "Your valor will not be forgotten!" He then flies away. As a show of her favor, after hearing **Sir Talavar**'s story, the Summer Queen leaves a gift for the characters on the threshold of the Palace of Heart's Desire (see *chapter 5*). Note this gift on the *Story Tracker*.

If the characters don't save **Sir Talavar**, one of the frayed ropes suspending the basket snaps after a few hours, causing it to tip enough that **Sir Talavar**'s birdcage tumbles out and falls to the ground, where it is either swallowed by one of Bavlorna's snakes or found by harengon brigands. In either event, **Sir Talavar** is returned to Downfall and handed over to Bavlorna, in which case the characters can find him in area B5, still locked in the silver birdcage.

### Telemy Hill
The characters might come here after their meeting with **Sir Talavar**, hoping to obtain the key that will free the faerie dragon from his magic birdcage. If the characters ignored **Sir Talavar** or failed to release him from his cage, Telemy Hill is merely the next stop on their journey.

Telemy Hill is an ancient fey entity, a sentient hill that travels throughout the Feywild and even to the Material Plane at times. The wandering hill interacts with others by way of the ancient willow trees that grow on its slopes.

Some time ago, a key-collecting goblin named **Jingle Jangle** took residence atop Telemy Hill. The goblin and the hill became fast friends. Three days ago, while searching the swamp for truffles, **Jingle Jangle** was ambushed and roughed up by brigands. She suffered no permanent damage but has been convalescing in her den since the attack. Telemy Hill is worried for its friend and hopes the characters can cheer up the goblin, perhaps by bringing her something to eat or drink.

#### Arrival at Telemy Hill
Telemy Hill is skirted in mist. When the characters pass through the mist and see the hill for the first time, read:

>>You are greeted by the scent of sweet-smelling fruit. Damp, downy, silvery-green moss blankets a gentle upward slope before giving way to a craggy ridge that marks the top of the hill. Dozens of enormous willow trees dot the hillside, swaying as though in a breeze despite the absence of one.
>>

Telemy Hill is approximately half a square mile wide. A narrow game trail leads to **Jingle Jangle**'s den at the pinnacle of the hill. The willows that grow on the hill are **awakened trees** that speak Common in low, rumbling voices. Telemy Hill uses the trees to communicate, rather than speaking itself.

As the characters move up the hill, 1d4 + 1 awakened trees approach them, stopping when the two groups are 10 feet apart. One of them welcomes the characters to Telemy Hill and asks how long they plan to stay.

If asked about **Jingle Jangle**, the awakened trees share the following information:

- **Jingle Jangle** is friendly. She collects keys and talks about them endlessly.
- She wears a coat of keys that jingle and jangle when she walks—hence her name.
- Three days ago, while rooting through the swamp for truffles, she was attacked and robbed by brigands. She hasn't left her hilltop den since returning to the hill and must be pretty hungry by now.

If the characters are hostile, the trees do what they can to drive the invaders off the hill. If the trees are not met with violence, they shepherd the characters up the hill to **Jingle Jangle**'s den, waving them on with their branches. Characters who stray from the path are met by 1d6 additional awakened trees. These trees don't attack but join in coaxing the characters up the hill.

At the top of the hill, the characters find **Jingle Jangle**'s den: a cave with an entryway shaped like a keyhole.

#### Obtaining the Silver Key
If one or more characters enter **Jingle Jangle**'s den on the hilltop, read:

>>Worn stone steps lead down into what feels like a cellar. It's chilly in here, and you detect a subtle scent of iron in the air. From a distant spot within the chamber, sputtering candles illuminate a multitude of keys dangling from taut strings that crisscross the walls. Hundreds of other keys lie strewn across the dirt floor.
>>
>>As you take in the scene, you hear the sound of keys jingling as a goblin emerges from the dimness. She wears a coat lined with metal keys and carries a flail that has padlocks for heads. She manages a faint smile and says, "How might **Jingle Jangle** unlock a bit of happiness in your lives today?"
>>

The oval-shaped den is 20 feet wide, 30 feet long, and 6 feet tall, with a smaller chamber at the back where **Jingle Jangle** sleeps.

**Jingle Jangle** is a **goblin** (chaotic good) who refers to herself in the third person. Replace her normal weapon attacks with the following action option:

>***Flail of Locks.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (3d4) bludgeoning damage.

One of the keys in **Jingle Jangle**'s collection is the silver key that unlocks **Sir Talavar**'s birdcage. If the characters want this key, **Jingle Jangle** offers it freely, saying, "Better you should have it than those long-eared brigands. First they stole **Jingle Jangle**'s truffles. Next, they'll want **Jingle Jangle**'s keys. Someone ought to give them a good shaking down so they know what it feels like!"

**Jingle Jangle**'s obsession with keys serves as a cautionary tale for those who would enter into a bargain with **Bavlorna Blightstraw**. The goblin once sought the hag's help in a desperate attempt to undo what she thought was a terrible curse: wherever **Jingle Jangle** went, she felt a tormenting fear of being caught on the wrong side of a locked door. When she appealed to Bavlorna for aid, the hag removed the goblin's ability to perceive that fear and replaced it with an insatiable and overwhelming need to collect keys. So great is this obsession that **Jingle Jangle** has lost her own sense of self and now refers to herself only in the third person.

*Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for **Jingle Jangle**.

#### Jingle Jangle's Tale of Woe
If the characters seem interested in hearing more about her recent altercation, or if they want to offer reciprocation for her gift of the silver key, **Jingle Jangle** reveals the following information:

>>"**Jingle Jangle** was digging for truffles in the swamp when a bunch of harengons leapt out from behind the reeds and shrubbery. They took **Jingle Jangle**'s truffles, threw **Jingle Jangle** down in the mud, and whacked **Jingle Jangle** with their wooden clubs."
>>

![[042-02-005.jingle-jangle.png|right|300]]

**Jingle Jangle** knows that Telemy Hill is well defended, so she's not concerned about her own well-being at the moment. However, she happily accepts any or all of the following as payment for the key to **Sir Talavar**'s cage:

- A bag of truffles or some other tasty snack
- A thirst-quenching beverage
- A solemn vow to avenge the abuse **Jingle Jangle** suffered at the hands of the harengon brigands

If the characters raise her spirits by offering her food, drink, or the promise of revenge, **Jingle Jangle** imparts the following useful information:

- **Agdon Longscarf** is the leader of the harengon brigands. He wears a bright blue scarf and moves as fast as lightning. Characters who head toward Brigands' Tollway might encounter him there.
- Brigands' Tollway is a series of old wooden catwalks that circle a giant tree stump. The brigands camp atop the stump because it gives them the advantage of high ground.
- The best guide in Hither is a pincer-clawed scarecrow named Clapperclaw. It hangs around Downfall and knows the way to the neighboring realm of Thither, which is ruled by a hag named Granny Nightshade.

#### Leaving Telemy Hill
The outcome of the characters' interaction with **Jingle Jangle** influences how Telemy Hill regards them.

***Helping Jingle Jangle.*** If the characters lift **Jingle Jangle**'s spirits, Telemy Hill is delighted. The awakened trees dance around the characters in appreciation, and one of them gives the characters an iron key that **Jingle Jangle** dropped in the dirt. The tree mysteriously claims the key will be useful later on (see area B19 of Bavlorna's cottage).

***Harming Jingle Jangle.*** If the characters harm **Jingle Jangle**, Telemy Hill commands 1d4 **awakened trees** to attack the characters as they emerge from the goblin's den. Whenever a tree is felled, another arrives to take its place until ten trees are killed, at which point Telemy Hill gives up the fight.

### Brigands' Tollway
The Brigands' Tollway is the headquarters of **Agdon Longscarf** and his gang of harengon brigands. It is also where the brigands collect tolls from travelers trying to reach Downfall. The brigands' base is located on an enormous tree stump, 80 feet in diameter and 30 feet above the surface of the bog. Crisscrossing causeways of wooden planks converge on the stump, bringing travelers toward the brigands from all directions.

![[043-02-006.agdon-longscarf.png|right|300]]

#### Approaching the Tollway

>>A foggy marsh stretches out before you. Rickety causeways made of wooden planks form a wide, web-like structure above the bog. Three hundred feet away, many of these causeways converge on an enormous, ivy-covered tree stump that rises a good ten feet above the twenty-foot-high fog bank that enshrouds it.
>>

The wooden causeways are 5 feet wide and in poor shape. Characters who walk across the planks are assumed to be taking care to avoid unsafe areas. If a character runs across the planks, roll a d8 at the end of the character's turn. On a 7 or 8, part of the causeway falls away beneath the character, who must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling off the plank and into the bog. While prone in the muck, the character is restrained. A character can use an action to try to free itself or another creature from the muck, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Most Notorious Brigand in Prismeer
As the characters make their way along one of the causeways, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices something:

>>An odd feeling suddenly comes over you as you become aware that somewhere along the way, a hunched, hooded figure has joined the group.
>>

The figure is a notorious harengon brigand named **Agdon Longscarf** (see the accompanying stat block), who snuck in among the characters for a laugh. He casts off his cloak with a flourish, revealing his 15-foot-long, bright blue scarf. He holds a hot branding iron in one hand and a small round shield in the other.

As Agdon throws off his cloak, the sound of a bagpipe erupts from somewhere up ahead. After a few notes, the characters recognize it as the song sung by the harengon brigands they met earlier (see "Arrival in Hither"). Agdon sings the song as he takes off at a run, a wide grin on his rabbit face as he bounds from one plank to another in a circle around the party. He and his fellow harengons know the causeways well enough to avoid sections that are too weak to support their weight.

Agdon is backed up by two skiffs, each one containing three **harengon brigands** and a **harengon sniper** (see *appendix C* for their stat blocks). The skiffs come from the direction of the giant tree stump. They emerge from the fog and become visible when they are 20 feet away. Each skiff has two rowers, a lookout (the sniper), and a bagpiper. The brigands spring onto nearby causeways, advance to melee range, and try to knock out characters and rob them without killing anyone, while the snipers stay in the skiffs. Any character rendered unconscious by the brigands is stable at 0 hit points.

#### Dealing with Agdon
In days gone by, **Agdon Longscarf** made a name for himself as he and his band of miscreants menaced travelers throughout various Feywild domains. It was in Prismeer, however, that Agdon's antics came to an end by Zybilna's hand. As punishment for his offenses, the archfey demanded that Agdon give up his beloved scarf. When he refused, Zybilna cursed him so that he would never be able to remove it. She then pinned the scarf to a young sapling with a magic nail made of gold and iron, and she bade the tree grow until its branches raked the clouds. Agdon was thus carried into the sky, where he was stranded for a long time.

The arrival of the Hourglass Coven signaled a reversal of **Agdon Longscarf**'s fortunes. With Zybilna trapped in temporal stasis, Agdon's loyal gang was able to chop down his tree prison. But his scarf remained pinned to the felled trunk, and him with it, until Bavlorna struck a deal with him—she agreed to remove the nail and free the scarf in exchange for the best prize from each of his raids thereafter.

Agdon's scarf is a bright blue length of cloth that he claims was woven from lightning bolts he stole right out from under a dark cloud. The scarf can't be removed, even if Agdon dies. His branding iron functions for him alone, and it ceases to be hot when it leaves his hand. The brand it makes is shaped like three bounding rabbits connected nose to tail, forming a triangle.

The brigand leader is cocky and boastful. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for **Agdon Longscarf**.

Aided by the magic of his scarf, he darts among the characters, using Quick Fingers to steal things as he passes. His speed and agility make him difficult to hit; however, grabbing hold of his trailing scarf can dissuade him.

As an action, a character can try to grab Agdon's scarf. Doing so requires a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check. While a character has him by the scarf, Agdon has a walking speed of 35 feet, and he can't move farther than 15 feet from the character. Agdon can use an action to try to pull his scarf free; this attempt is resolved with a Strength (Athletics) contest. If he fails to free himself after one try, he surrenders immediately, blubbering and pleading for his life like a coward.

#### Development
Either the characters defeat **Agdon Longscarf**, or he and his brigands subdue and capture them.

***Agdon Is Defeated.*** If Agdon is killed, his followers wander away, crestfallen. If Agdon lives, his former followers shun him. They regard the characters as formidable, and they enthusiastically offer to show them the way to *Downfall*, providing a skiff for their use if they so desire.

If they are asked about **Bavlorna Blightstraw** or Downfall, the harengons share the following information:

- Agdon made a pact with Slack-jawed Lorna by which he is obligated to give her one item he steals from each victim.
- Though Agdon would never admit such a thing, the harengons suspect that their leader is terrified of Slack-jawed Lorna, who moves about on a crawling lily pad.
- Downfall is home to the Soggy Court, a society of bullywugs that clings to strange, noble customs and rules of etiquette.

***The Characters Are Captured.*** If the characters are knocked unconscious, they are taken to Downfall and placed in the cages that hang outside Bavlorna's cottage (area B14).

#### Big Stump
The harengons have set up camp atop the 30-foot-high, 80-foot-wide tree stump. Wooden skiffs are moored among the cattails and grasses that poke up from the water surrounding the ancient stump, and rope ladders hanging off the edges of the trunk enable approaching creatures to climb to the surface of the stump without having to make an ability check.

The brigands' encampment is a circle of twelve patchwork tents surrounding a carved wooden throne where **Agdon Longscarf** holds court. Piled around Agdon's throne are scores of worthless trinkets stolen from travelers. If the characters want to examine the trinkets, describe a few of them, using the entries in the Feywild Trinkets table in the introduction for inspiration. Lying amid the trinkets is a small bag of truffles (the same ones the brigands stole from **Jingle Jangle**).

At any given time, 1d4 **harengon brigands** and 1d4 **harengon snipers** (see *appendix C* for their stat blocks) occupy the camp. These harengons defend their turf only if they outnumber intruders; otherwise, they scatter and hide.

## Downfall
Downfall is Bavlorna's home in the murky swamp of Hither. The settlement consists of a collection of outbuildings and ruins surrounding the hag's monstrous cottage. Courtly bullywugs, all beholden to Bavlorna, reside in Downfall. Bavlorna rarely leaves the confines of her cottage, which contains her preservation pond as well as her treasures and her chimeric taxidermy creations.

The water level in and around Downfall is always high (see "Fluctuating Swamp Waters" earlier in the chapter). Thick fog hangs over all outdoor areas, limiting visibility to 20 feet.

## Where's Bavlorna?
The characters first encounter the hag in her study (area B10). After that, she is free to move around, though she won't leave her cottage without good reason.

## The Soggy Court
The Soggy Court is a community of neutral bullywugs who have an overdeveloped sense of grandeur. They are preoccupied with pomp and courtesies, and they possess an insatiable lust for courtly intrigue. A monarch presides over the group, though regime changes are frequent and often bloody. The current leader is Gullop XIX, who won the throne by boiling his predecessor, Molubb XVI, in oil.

The community is small, but plots abound. A violent coup is always just around the corner. Whenever there's a commotion anywhere in Downfall, bullywug courtiers clamor to find out what's happening. If a loud noise occurs, such as the clangor of combat or raised voices, 1d6 + 1 **bullywugs** converge on the source. These bullywugs crave gossip, not violence, and are indifferent toward strangers. They will defend themselves and Downfall if they deem it necessary or politically advantageous.

Bullywugs of the Soggy Court speak Bullywug, Common, and Sylvan.

Use the Bullywug Names table and the Soggy Court Honorifics table to make members of the court distinctive, as you see fit.

## Downfall Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of Downfall.

![[045-map-2.3-downfall-player.jpg|right|300]]
### D1. Channel
The characters will likely arrive by skiff, rowboat, or raft, by way of this channel. This waterway flows into Murky Lake (*area D7*).

>>Thick fog hangs heavy in the air, obscuring the area around you so that the world appears to have shrunk to only twenty feet in all directions. Before you, the waterway widens and the current slows, giving the impression that you have entered a lake. Croaking voices penetrate the fog, through which dark shapes appear, resolving into two rowboats. Manning the oars of each rowboat are two bullywugs.
>>

The four **bullywugs** (neutral) are enjoying a boat ride on the lake. All four are dressed in soiled garb typical of members of the Soggy Court. In croaking Sylvan, they say, "Welcome to Downfall, travelers."

If the characters don't attack immediately, the bullywugs explain that their king, Gullop XIX, would be honored to make the characters' acquaintance. They suggest that the characters head to the small dock nearby (next to area D2), then make their way across the stepping stones (*area D3*), through the balloon factory (*area D4*), and across the bridge of chattering heads (*area D5*) to the gazebo where Gullop XIX holds court (*area D6*). If the characters ask about Bavlorna, the bullywugs insist that the characters see the king first, saying that he'll know how to help them.

If the characters attack the bullywugs, they croak loudly enough to alert the two guards atop the watchtower (*area D19*). These guards sound the alarm with loud croaks of their own. One minute later, six armed **bullywugs** (neutral) rally at the base of the watchtower before setting out to subdue the characters and bring them before Gullop XIX for questioning.

> ##### Swamp Gas Balloons
>A swamp gas balloon has two separate parts:
>
>- The wicker basket, which can carry up to 750 pounds, is a Large object with AC 11, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
>- The balloon, which contains the swamp gas that provides lift, is a Huge object with AC 11, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the balloon drops to 0 hit points, it bursts, and the vehicle loses the ability to fly.

>To rise into the air, the balloon must be filled with swamp gas. A flap at the bottom of the balloon lets the gas in, and the balloon takes 10 minutes to fill when empty. Once filled, the balloon rises into the air. One can force the balloon to land by using an action to open a flap at the top of the balloon, which allows the swamp gas to escape. To reach this flap, one must climb or fly to the top of the balloon, 20 feet above the basket. The balloon's rigging makes such a climb possible.
>
>The vehicle has no form of propulsion, instead relying on the pilot's ability to navigate air currents.
>
>As long as the balloon or basket has at least 1 hit point, it can be repaired. Repairing 1 hit point of damage to either part of the vehicle requires 1 day and the necessary supplies, which can be salvaged from *area D4* or taken from area B3.
>

### D2. Damaged Balloon

>>Looming above a ramshackle wooden pier is a balloon anchored by four thick ropes tied around wooden posts driven deep into the mire. The balloon's bladder expands and sags at irregular intervals as swamp gas fills it briefly before leaking out through various tears in its patchwork fabric. A bullywug stands near the top of a ladders and is using a long silver needle and a spool of catgut to sew up one of the openings. A second bullywug stands at the foot of the ladder to steady it. Huddled nearby are three giant frogs whose long tongues snap up passing insects.
>>

The two **bullywugs** (neutral) watch the characters warily but pose no threat. The three **giant frogs** are here to prevent anyone from stealing the balloon. (Another one of Bavlorna's balloons was stolen recently. Characters encountered what was left of it at Slanty Tower earlier in the chapter.)

If the characters strike up a conversation with the bullywugs, the one on the ground responds in Sylvan, "Hmmm. You should probably see the king," regardless of what the characters say.

***Swamp Gas Balloon.*** This vehicle is operational, albeit damaged. The balloon itself has 10 hit points remaining (out of a maximum of 15), and the bullywugs are in the midst of repairing it. The basket and the ropes that attach it to the balloon are intact and undamaged. For more information on Downfall's balloons, see the "Swamp Gas Balloons" sidebar.

### D3. Stepstone Crossing

>>A row of boulders spaced two feet apart breach the surface of the lake to form a walking path across a forty-foot-wide waterway.
>>

The water around the stepstones is only 4 feet deep, but the bottom is not visible through the murk.

Four of the five stepstones are boulders sunk deep in the mire. The middle stepstone is actually the top of a **galeb duhr**. If someone steps on it, the galeb duhr takes offense, grumbling about ingratitude. An apology accompanied by a successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check satisfies the galeb duhr. On a failed check, the galeb duhr gives the offending character one more chance, allowing the character to repeat the check provided the apology is sung with feeling. On a second failed check or if the character refuses to sing, the galeb duhr uses its Animate Boulders action to affect the two boulders closest to it, and the three of them move 15 feet to the west, leaving a 20-foot gap in the path formed by the stepstones. Any character who was standing atop one of the stones is dumped into the water.

***Predators Below.*** Two **merrow** lurk in the water east of the crossing. They dislike the taste of bullywugs and ignore them, but they attack any non-bullywugs that enter the water. If the characters find themselves in battle with the merrow, 1d4 + 1 **bullywugs** (neutral) arrive immediately after each merrow has taken two turns. The bullywugs hurl spears at the merrow, frightening them away (at least for a while). These bullywugs are glad to be of help and happily point characters in the direction of their king, Gullop XIX (at *area D6*). If the characters offer the bullywugs nothing in return for their help, the bullywugs take no offense. They don't expect foreigners to honor the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" earlier in the chapter).

### D4. Burned-out Balloon Factory

>>This wooden structure stands on stilts above the lake. It is topped by a steep, conical roof made of thatch. Smoke curls up from a hole at its apex. Its windows are blacked out, and the air carries the smell of burned wood. A clothesline attached to one corner of the building's exterior is hung with a variety of frayed, patchwork garments.
>>

The garments on the clothesline aren't particularly well made or valuable. The line leads to Bavlorna's cottage (*area D12*), which is *heavily obscured* by the thick fog. The line can support up to 200 pounds of additional weight.

The building is accessible by ramps from areas D3 and D5, as well as stairs that rise from the lake. A rickety wooden deck clings to the outside of the structure 6 feet above the water. Use the following boxed text to describe the building's interior:

>>This room is a charred mess. Hazy smoke hangs over scattered piles of burned and broken shelves intermixed with whatever those shelves contained. Wisps of smoke snake into the air from several spots where smoldering wreckage threatens to ignite.
>>
>>A distressed bullywug in a leather smock scurries around the room with a bucket of water whose contents spill out over the sides in his haste.
>>

This is where Bavlorna's swamp gas balloons are manufactured. Two bullywugs recently set fire to the place, destroying most of the supplies as a consequence. One of the culprits was Wigglewog, **Sir Talavar**'s pilot (now deceased). The other was Morgort, the former Knight of Warts, who was captured before she could make her escape and is now being held prisoner in *area D9*.

A **bullywug** (neutral) named Duke Ickrind is overseeing the repair of the factory, but new fires keep popping up thanks to the persistence of the animated coals that were used to start the fire originally. When the characters enter the place, Duke Ickrind yells in Sylvan, "Grab a bucket! We have to make sure the fires are out!"

A low workbench—the only piece of undamaged furniture in the room—has three wooden buckets on it. Two of them are filled with water.

If the characters help Duke Ickrind extinguish the coals, he gives them a brass brooch shaped like a fly, with wings that flutter. He tells them to wear the brooch when they present themselves to Gullop XIX, saying it will help win the king's trust.

***Animated Coals.*** Typically used to heat Bavlorna's cauldron in *area D18*, six of these coals were brought to the balloon factory by saboteurs who wanted to burn it down. The coals are Tiny animated objects that skip and bounce around. Each one has AC 18; 6 hit points; a speed of 30 feet; and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. A coal's Dexterity is 20, its Constitution is 10, and its other ability scores are 1. Throwing a bucket of water on a coal requires a successful ranged attack, and the bucket is treated as an improvised weapon. A bucket of water deals 1d6 damage to a coal. An animated coal that is submerged in water takes the damage at the start of each of its turns until it is no longer submerged. A coal reduced to 0 hit points is inanimate and harmless.

Each coal can take the following action on its turn:

>***Kindle.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage, and the target catches fire if it is flammable. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

### D5. Chattering Heads

>>This flat wood-plank bridge, which spans an arm of the lake, is lined on one side by rows of bullywug heads on wooden spikes.
>>
>>At the center of the bridge, a small figure sits with its feet dangling over one side. The figure appears to be talking to itself in bemoaned tones. But then the severed bullywug heads nearby erupt in a cacophony of voices—some indignant, others sympathetic. A few in a more distant row yell, "What? I couldn't hear what they said!"
>>

The bridge is in decent condition and safe to cross.

***Beheaded Bullywugs.*** Deposed bullywug monarchs of the Soggy Court often lose their heads during violent changes in leadership. The severed heads are impaled on rows of spikes north of the bridge, and they verbally accost anyone who steps onto the bridge, each one speaking of its own glorious rule and how the Soggy Court has become a mockery since its reign came to an end. In conversation, a head might share one or more of the following pieces of information:

- All the heads belong to former monarchs who were deposed and killed by usurpers. Many of the former monarchs were betrayed by others whose rotting heads now also sit on spikes.
- The current monarch is King Gullop XIX. All the heads agree he is a weak ruler. They've heard rumors of yet another coup in the works.
- **Sir Talavar**, Bavlorna's escaped prisoner, had help from bullywugs of the Soggy Court. One of his accomplices languishes in prison, awaiting trial.
- Bavlorna is a distrustful shut-in who loathes her sisters, especially **Skabatha Nightshade**.
- Bavlorna has a pool in her cottage that's very important to her. She spends a lot of time bathing in it.

***In Search of a Skull.*** The figure chatting with the severed heads is **Clapperclaw the scarecrow** (see the accompanying stat block), who is 3 feet tall. Created by Granny Nightshade using a tormented child's soul she found in Gehenna, it ran away from home so that it wouldn't have to perform evil tasks for her. After fleeing Thither, Clapperclaw was waylaid by **Agdon Longscarf** and his harengon brigands, who stole its head, which the scarecrow describes as a most glorious stag skull. It desperately wants its head back, and it's a bit self-conscious about its replacement head: a hollow gourd that now sits askew on its shoulders. Eight copper coins are sealed inside the gourd, causing the head to rattle whenever Clapperclaw nods, turns, or shakes its head.

Clapperclaw knows the way to Thither from Hither and will guide the characters there if they help it recover its head. If the characters accept its offer, the scarecrow does its best to stay out of harm's way while the characters continue to explore Hither. It fears **Bavlorna Blightstraw** too much to enter her cottage, but it will patiently wait for the characters outside the cottage if they choose to enter it. The scarecrow has a similar aversion to the other hags of the Hourglass Coven.

When the characters arrive, Clapperclaw is telling the severed bullywug heads the story of how **Agdon Longscarf** stole its original head and how its current head is a poor substitute. Unknown to Clapperclaw, Agdon gave the skull to Bavlorna, who now keeps it in her cottage's treasure room (area B19).

Clapperclaw carries a sailcloth sack filled with moldy straw. If the scarecrow gets hurt, it heals itself by stuffing itself with replacement straw or similar plant matter.

*Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Clapperclaw.

### D6. His Royal Majesty Gullop XIX

>>A grand marble gazebo stands atop a mound of soggy earth, its white stone streaked green with algae. The support pillars have sunk into the muck unevenly so that the domed canopy now sits askew.
>>
>>Short steps ring the gazebo, leading to a raised floor where bullywugs dressed in shabby clothing lounge on pillows. Among them, a harpist sends forth delicate notes that mingle with the murmured croaking of the gathered nobles. On a dais, a flabby bullywug wearing a crown of woven lily flowers sits on an ornate throne with his legs folded under him. He has a large leather-bound book open across his lap and is mouthing the words he reads on the pages. Without looking up, he says, "Have you no herald to announce your presence before King Gullop the Nineteenth?" He slams the book closed as if to punctuate his question, regarding you for the first time.
>>
>>Sleepy bullywug guards standing around their monarch snap to attention and ready their weapons.
>>

King Gullop XIX, a **bullywug royal** (neutral) is accompanied by a baby crocodile (a Small noncombatant) named Snoodle and protected by five **bullywug knights** (neutral; see *appendix C* for their stat blocks). The knights are stationed around the edge of the gazebo's interior. Eight unarmed bullywugs (noncombatants) lounge at the king's feet, eating insects from platters as they gossip among themselves. The king treats visitors as honored guests in accordance with the rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" earlier in the chapter), but he expects a measure of kindness in return. If a fight breaks out, Gullop XIX flees to *area D11* and makes his final stand there, counting on the bullywug knights to cover his escape. As the king flees, Snoodle and the unarmed bullywugs jump into the lake and swim to safety.

***Scheming King.*** The king has only recently come into his position, but already his reign is a troubled one. **Sir Talavar**'s recent escape through the theft of one of Bavlorna's prized balloons has left many of the king's subjects questioning his ability to manage a crisis. He has grown paranoid over the prospect of incurring the hag's wrath, a suspicion confirmed in the pages of the book in his lap—Bavlorna's Big Book of Bad Blood—in which the hag's displeasure with her enemies is spelled out in detail. He procured the book from a darkling merchant (see area B10), who stole it from Bavlorna a few hours ago.

King Gullop is looking for a way to avoid Bavlorna's ire, and the characters might be his way out. He wants them to return the book to Bavlorna and assure her that Gullop didn't steal it, but merely ensured its safekeeping.

If the characters portray themselves as allies (perhaps by presenting the brooch they received from Duke Ickrind in *area D4*), Gullop explains that only members of the Soggy Court are allowed to speak with Bavlorna (a falsehood he knows to be untrue), and he invites the characters to join the group. If they accept, he instructs them to proceed to the palace in area D11 to be fitted with the proper attire. Once they are appropriately garbed, Gullop gives the characters the *Big Book of Bad Blood* and encourages them, as duly appointed emissaries of the Soggy Court, to return it to the hag with great haste.

If the characters show hostility or refuse to join the Soggy Court, Gullop commands his guards to seize them. Captured characters are taken to the holding cell in *area D8*.

***Secret Note.*** As the king addresses the characters, one of the bullywug noncombatants passes a wine goblet to one randomly determined character. Inside the cup is a scrap of parchment with words written on it in Sylvan. The message reads, "Find Illig, the Baron of Muckstump, at once. The revolution lives!" Illig is an ambitious noble looking to take Gullop's crown by force, and conspirators are gathering at his home in *area D16*. Whenever a character asks a friendly bullywug of the Soggy Court about Illig's whereabouts, roll a d8. On a roll of 1–3, the bullywug doesn't know where Illig is. On a roll of 4–6, the bullywug assumes (incorrectly) that Illig is somewhere in the Sinking Palace (area D11). On a roll of 7 or 8, the bullywug knows and shares Illig's actual location.

### D7. Murky Lake
Downfall is built around a 20-foot-deep body of standing water called Murky Lake. A blanket of thick fog and a layer of pond scum cover the lake's surface. Heavily obscured by the fog are 2d6 bullywugs (noncombatants) spread out across several large lily pads and relaxing in rowboats. Some read to each other, and others nap or play music. When they see the characters, they wave in a friendly manner. If the characters ask for directions, one of the bullywugs tries to be helpful while the others gaze about listlessly. If the characters require any further assistance or information, the helpful bullywug suggests that they speak to King Gullop XIX and points the way to his Royal Majesty (area D6). Each lily pad can hold up to 250 pounds without sinking.

***Bavlorna's Cottage.*** The hag's cottage (*area D12*) looms over the middle of the lake on thick wooden stilts. The cottage is *heavily obscured* by thick fog, though characters within 20 feet of it can discern its shape.

### D8. Holding Cells

>>Rising from the soggy earth is a sturdy wooden hut with an open doorway on one side of it. At the back of the hut are two holding cells. Thick mangrove roots serve as bars, with a small round door closing off each cell. The floor of one cell is covered with several inches of stinking water. The other cell holds a figure in rags slumped against the back wall.
>>

This hut is round, 12 feet in diameter, with a conical thatched roof that rises 18 feet from the floor at its apex. Prisoners of the Soggy Court are held here while they await trial by combat in area D9. Characters brought here as prisoners are thrown into the north cell. The guards depart after locking up the characters.

A character can use an action to try to break into or out of a cell, tearing through its root walls with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check. A cell door's lock can be picked in 1 minute with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check, provided the character making the check has thieves' tools.

***Prisoner.*** The prisoner in the south cell is an unarmed **bullywug knight** (see *appendix C*) named Morgort, the Knight of Warts. She was one of **Sir Talavar**'s accomplices along with Wigglewog, and she now awaits justice. She has no regrets about helping the faerie dragon, and she regards Bavlorna as a bitter enemy. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Morgort.

Morgort introduces herself to the characters with a knightly bow once the guards are gone. She is dressed in the ragged and stained remnants of an orange surcoat that bears the sigil of a great helm fashioned to resemble a frog's head.

In conversation, she asks the characters why they were apprehended and reveals the following information:

- Morgort is an accomplished balloon pilot. She and her friend, Wigglewog, helped the honorable **Sir Talavar** escape. To delay their pursuers long enough for Wigglewog and **Sir Talavar** to steal a balloon, she was forced to stay behind and got captured as a result.
- It's likely that she will be battling one of the characters in trial by combat (see area D9 for details).
- Bavlorna is a recluse who rarely leaves her cottage. She enjoys making foul bargains with visitors.

If the characters share the news that Wigglewog died helping **Sir Talavar**, Morgort grows sullen. If the characters need to get out of Downfall in a hurry, Morgort suggests that they steal the balloon in *area D2* and use it to fly to safety. (The balloon can also deliver the characters safely to Thither if that's where they want to go, as discussed at the end of this chapter.) She follows the party's lead otherwise and tries her best to be helpful. Once she realizes the characters have important things to do, she tries not to embroil them in bullywug politics. In any situation, she tries to act with honor and civility.

### D9. Proving Grounds

>>A mangrove tree stands in the middle of a patch of heavily churned mud, where rusting and rotting bits of armor and weapons are scattered. Two lengths of chain are anchored to opposite sides of the tree trunk, each with an iron shackle on the end.
>>

Justice in the Soggy Court is carried out using trials by combat. Prisoners fight for their freedom here, as do those who want to challenge the monarch for the right to rule.

The grounds are 20 feet in diameter. Combatants are shackled by one wrist or ankle to a 10-foot length of chain attached to the tree. Each chain has AC 19, 11 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Using an action, a creature can pull a chain free of the tree with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check.

***Combat Rules.*** A trial by combat is a procedure by which wrongs can be redressed in the Soggy Court. It can also be invoked as a vote of no confidence in the current monarch. A trial always has two combatants: the accused and the accuser, or surrogates representing them. Once they are shackled, the combatants fight until one is dead, and justice is thereby served.

***Development.*** One hour after the characters are imprisoned in area D9, four armed **bullywugs** (neutral) come to get them and Morgort. The guards instruct the characters to choose a champion from among them to represent the group in the trial. The guards nominate someone if the characters don't choose a champion. The champion and Morgort are each chained to the tree and given a club. The rest of the characters are kept at the edge of the proving grounds, held at spearpoint to prevent them from interfering.

King Gullop XIX presides over the trial, instructing the combatants to fight for their innocence. Morgort pretends to be slain after any successful attack made against her, putting on quite a performance as she drops to the mud. The characters' champion is declared victorious, and the characters are decreed to be innocent.

The characters might try to fight their way out of the situation or make a break for it. If they succeed, bullywugs who oppose the king advise the characters to take refuge with Illig, Baron of Muckstump, who lives across the lake (see *area D16*). Illig is Gullop's greatest political rival.

If the characters are proclaimed innocent, they earn their freedom. Each is given the worthless honorific of "True Friend of Gullop XIX" and permission to use the king's palace (*area D11*) as a place to rest. Morgort's seemingly lifeless body is dumped into Murky Lake, whereupon she swims to *area D2* and steals the swamp gas balloon there.

### D10. Trinket, Bauble, and Charm's

>>A big black balloon floats over the lake, tugging at its moorings. Beneath it hangs a basket made of black wicker and wood, which serves as a merchant's stall. A large pane of gray glass is drawn closed across an opening above the counter. A sign mounted above the window reads, "Wondrous Wares & Fair Fares!"
>>
>>The balloon is not made of fabric, but rather appears to be a roiling, dark rain cloud that has been contained somehow with lines and netting.
>>

Two **darklings** (see *appendix C*) named Trinket and Bauble look after the balloon and lurk inside the cramped merchant's stall, which is open for business. Their boss, Charm, is a **darkling elder** (see appendix C) who is presently visiting **Bavlorna Blightstraw** in her cottage.

Charm travels around Prismeer in her "rain cloud balloon" while posing as a merchant. She is actually a burglar working for Bavlorna's sister, **Endelyn Moongrave**. Charm has come to Downfall to steal treasure from under Bavlorna's nose. Trinket and Bauble guard the stall while Charm sees to the real business of carrying out her heist (described later in the chapter).

Trinket and Bauble greet their customers with plenty of sass. Since their business is a front, they don't care whether they sell anything or not.

***Wondrous Wares.*** A sign hanging below the counter lists the following items for sale:

>> ##### Available for a Limited Time Only:
>>Very good thimble (fingertip not included)
>>
>>Mug of Bumble Beer (has a nice sting to it)
>>
>>Duskmallow pie (with decorative bite marks)
>>
>>Bundle of dry wood (great for starting fires)
>>
>>Ink portraits (if we have to look at you, so should you)
>>
>>Moonlight monocle (no more fumbling in the dark)
>>

Most of the items for sale are nonmagical goods of little or no value, the exception being the moonlight monocle, which is a magic eyepiece that Charm acquired some time ago. It has the same properties as *goggles of night*.

***Unicorn Horn.*** If the *Story Tracker* indicates that the unicorn horn is here, it is among the items available for purchase. If the characters seem interested in conducting a transaction, Trinket produces the unicorn horn and says, "Very hard to come by, unicorn horns, and one never knows when one might come in handy. This one recently found its way into my possession."

***Payment.*** The darklings make one of the following demands as compensation for any single item the characters desire:

- Trinket demands the color from the buyer's eyes. If the buyer agrees to the trade, Trinket produces a small marble that drains the color from the buyer's eyes when she utters the phrase, "Hue be mine." Robbed of their color, the buyer's irises turn transparent. Destroying the marble restores the buyer's eye color to normal.
- Bauble demands the rhythm in the buyer's step. If the buyer agrees to the trade, Bauble produces an articulated wooden marionette and makes it dance on the countertop while repeatedly uttering, "One, two, three. One, two, three." Deprived of this rhythm, the buyer loses all talent for dancing. Destroying the marionette restores the buyer's dancing ability, but Bauble won't give up the marionette without a fight.

***Rain Cloud Balloon.*** If the characters steal this balloon, it delivers them to area M16 of Motherhorn (see *chapter 4*) unless they have a trained pilot who can fly it elsewhere. The balloon harnesses the energy of a rain cloud to stay aloft. To use the balloon, the harnessed cloud must be charged with electrical energy. This can be accomplished by dealing more than 20 lightning damage to the cloud from a single source, or by surrounding it with electrically charged storm clouds for at least 10 minutes. Once charged, the balloon can stay airborne for 8 hours, moving at up to 8 miles per hour. If the balloon loses its charge while aloft, it plummets to the ground.

The vessel has two separate parts: the wooden basket that doubles as the merchant's stall, and the balloon, which includes the rain cloud plus the net and lines that hold it in place and attach it to the basket. Each part has its own statistics:

- **Basket** The basket, which can hold up to 750 pounds, has AC 13, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
- **Balloon** The balloon has AC 11, 50 hit points, and immunity to lightning, poison, psychic, and thunder damage. If the balloon drops to 0 hit points, the cloud dissipates, and the vehicle loses the ability to fly.

Repairing 1 hit point of damage to the basket requires 1 day and appropriate supplies, which can be salvaged from *area D4* or taken from area B3. The balloon can't be repaired, but as long as it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all lost hit points when it is fully recharged.

![[048-02-008.rain-cloud-balloon.png|right|300]]

### D11. Sinking Palace
The palace has two entrances: one on high ground to the northwest, the other overlooking the docks. Each entrance has two **bullywugs** (neutral) and a **crocodile** guarding it. These sentries deny entry to anyone who doesn't have an invitation from the bullywug king.

>>This ramshackle hall is built around a big tree. Two of the tree's limbs reach out through the walls like enormous welcoming arms. The interior of the hall is roomy, with an open floor plan that allows occupants of the upper story to look out over the lower one. Bullywug courtiers crowd into the space, filling it with their guttural croaks. Their clothing is faded and stained with mud.
>>

The palace has two levels:

- **Upper Level** The upper level is built around the trunk of a tree. Gathered here at any given time are 2d4 unarmed and unarmored bullywug courtiers, some of them reclining on pillows. Among these noncombatants are three **bullywugs** (neutral) who would defend their honor if they thought it besmirched by hostile interlopers.
- **Lower Level** The lower level is submerged in 3 inches of swamp water. More bullywug courtiers fill this space as a trio of bullywug musicians play an upbeat tune on stringed instruments. These bullywugs are also noncombatants.

***Clothesline.*** A clothesline attached to the southwest corner of the building's exterior has a variety of frayed, patchwork garments draped over it. The line leads to Bavlorna's cottage, which is heavily obscured by the fog over the lake. The line can support up to 200 pounds of additional weight.

### D12. Bavlorna's Cottage
Four flights of wooden steps rise out of the swamp, ending at a trapdoor in the underside of Bavlorna's cottage, which is perched atop tall, thick wooden stilts and surrounded by dense fog. See "Bavlorna's Cottage" later in the chapter for details.

### D13. Big Barkless

>>Several holes dot the trunk of a gnarled old tree that grows on the shore of the lake. The tree has lost all its bark, and a few withered leaves cling to the ends of its twisted, knotted branches. One end of a clothesline is tied to a high branch on the northwest side of the tree. Several old garments hang from the clothesline, the other end of which disappears into the fog hovering over the lake.
>>

Big Barkless is a **tree blight**, a carnivorous, ambulatory Plant of menacing disposition (see the accompanying stat block). While it remains motionless, it easily passes for a dead tree. Four **sprites** live in hollow cavities in its trunk. Their names are Bitzi, Dandy, Mintleaf, and Timpella. The sprites are a bitter bunch, taunting those who come close by spewing forth insulting words and tiny arrows. They hope to provoke the characters into damaging Big Barkless, thus prompting the blight to fight back. While ridiculing the characters from their hollows, the sprites have three-quarters cover.

Big Barkless remains rooted to the spot until it's required to act in its own defense, whereupon it uproots itself and attacks all creatures it perceives as threatening. That doesn't include the sprites, even if the sprites instigated the conflict. The blight will not chase prey into the lake but can move on land as far as it wants.

If the sprites take any damage, they withdraw deep into the tree blight, gaining total cover. The sprites evacuate and disperse into the swamp if the tree blight is reduced to 0 hit points.

***Clothesline.*** A clothesline attached to Big Barkless is hung with frayed, patchwork garments. The line leads to Bavlorna's cottage. If the tree blight moves more than 5 feet farther away from the cottage, the clothesline snaps in the middle, and the garments fall into the lake. The line can support up to 200 pounds of additional weight.

### D14. Toadstool Patch

>>Your heart suddenly feels cold, filling you with a sense of loneliness that borders on despair. A haunting, melancholy tune played on a flute reaches out to you from somewhere within a field of oversized toadstools.
>>

If the characters follow the music to its source, read:

>>A slender elf with pale blue skin and black hair sits curled in the shadow of a gray, six-foot-tall toadstool, playing a somber tune on a double flute.
>>

The flutist is a wood elf named Octavian Meliamne, who came to Bavlorna seeking magic that would make him forget his lost loves. A deal was struck, but when it came time for him to pay up, Octavian refused to give Bavlorna what she wanted in return: Octavian's still-beating heart. As punishment, Bavlorna took what she wanted by force, switching out Octavian's heart for a goat's heart so that he would not die. The process left the elf unable to feel or exhibit emotion.

Octavian is truthful with the characters about what happened to him. He knows what Bavlorna did was wrong, but he can't seem to get worked up about it. He suspects the hag is keeping his heart as a trophy. Unbeknownst to Octavian, Bavlorna is using his heart to keep her meat locker cold (see area B12).

Use the **scout** stat block to represent Octavian, with the following changes:

- Octavian is a wood elf (chaotic good) who speaks Common and Elvish. He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- He has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.

***Treasure.*** If the characters return his original heart to him, Octavian reciprocates by giving them his *pipes of haunting*.

While Octavian and his true heart are within 5 feet of one another, any spell that ends a curse can swap the goat's heart in Octavian's chest with his still-beating true heart. When Octavian regains his true heart, the goat's heart appears at his feet as a dead, desiccated lump of tissue. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the goat's heart after it is removed from Octavian's body, and an *identify* spell or similar magic reveals what it does. A creature that eats more than half of the goat's heart gains the benefit of a *potion of invulnerability*.

***Development.*** Once Octavian has his true heart and his capacity for feeling emotion restored, he skips merrily into the swamp, eventually crossing paths with the Inn at the End of the Road (see "Random Encounters in Hither"), where he stays for the foreseeable future. His joyful presence cheers up the inn's glum innkeeper, Tsu Harabax.

### D15. Bullywug Hut
The wooden door to this dwelling is closed but not locked.

>>This hut has a steep thatch roof. A small wooden chest rests in the middle of the floor, and scattered around it are six fraying silk cushions.
>>
>>The air in here carries the stench of decaying fish. A lit brazier hangs from a rafter, providing the dwelling's only light.
>>

No bullywugs are present.

***Treasure.*** The small wooden chest contains cookware, spices, old fishbones, and a mummified toad. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of evocation magic around the toad, and an *identify* spell or similar magic reveals what it does.

If the mummified toad is tossed into a pot or kettle of water, it disappears and produces a *darkness* spell that emanates from the container and lasts for 10 minutes.

### D16. Bullywug Hut
The wooden door to this dwelling is barred shut from the inside. If the characters knock on the door or otherwise announce their arrival, a bullywug inside the dwelling croaks (first in Bullywug and then in Common), "Push the note under the door." The bullywug is referring to the secret message the characters received in *area D6*. If the characters comply, the bullywug lifts the bar, opens the door, and allows them inside. If the characters don't comply or don't have the note, a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check convinces the bullywug to open the door and let them in. Otherwise, a character can use an action to try to force open the door, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check.

When the characters peer inside, read:

>>Standing just inside the door is a jittery bullywug with a spear, and behind this guard is a wooden crate with hunting gear piled atop it. Huddled in the back of the hut are four more bullywugs. Tension hangs heavy in the air as one of the huddled bullywugs signals you to enter and join their conversation.
>>

This dwelling provides shelter to a group of bullywugs that is plotting to overthrow King Gullop XIX. Their leader is a **bullywug knight** (neutral evil; see *appendix C*) named Illig, Baron of Muckstump. The other four **bullywugs** (neutral evil) are Illig loyalists named Glorig, Grundelkrantz, Gullibek, and Voolp.

Illig regards Gullop XIX as a witless buffoon unworthy of the crown and plans to declare himself the rightful king. He proudly shows off a drawing on the mud floor that depicts a crude image of Gullop XIX with a dagger in his eye. Illig's plot is straightforward: he intends to approach Gullop XIX while the king sits on his throne, pretend to trip into him, and "accidentally" stick him in the eye with the dagger. If Illig views the characters as coconspirators, he's eager to hear what they think of his cunning plan. If they have a better one, he wants to hear it.

If the characters try to leave before Illig is ready to pull off his attempted coup, Illig and his allies become suspicious of them unless the party succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) group check. On a failed check, the bullywugs attack the characters to prevent them from betraying Illig to Gullop XIX.

If one or more characters force their way inside, Illig's allies try to hold the intruders back long enough for Illig to use an action to hurriedly wipe away the plans drawn on the floor. If he succeeds in doing so, Illig feigns innocence while demanding that the characters leave the hut at once.

***Crate.*** The wooden crate has Bavlorna's name scrawled on it in Sylvan. The hunting gear piled on top of it includes a heavy crossbow, six crossbow bolts, a hunting trap, and a rolled-up cape of moss. Inside the crate are seven woodland animal carcasses, which the bullywugs intend to deliver to Bavlorna (an amateur taxidermist) once Illig is installed as the new king of the Soggy Court.

***Development.*** If the bullywug conspirators are not stopped or the king is not warned, the coup succeeds and Illig becomes King Illig I. If the characters warn Gullop XIX or thwart the conspirators, the coup fails.

If the coup is thwarted because of the characters' actions, Gullop XIX rewards them with Illig's former title, dubbing each of them "Duke of Muckstump." These titles come with no lands or holdings, but other members of the Soggy Court are envious and eager to befriend the new nobility.

### D17. King's Mount
The wooden door to this dwelling is closed but not locked.

>>A frayed rope tethers a giant toad to a wooden post in the middle of this hut. The toad looks uncomfortable as a pair of sticky, webbed hands push their way out of its mouth. The toad's jaws open wide as it regurgitates a bullywug, who falls prone on the floor.
>>

The **giant toad** is Gullop XIX's mount. The regurgitated **bullywug** (neutral) is the toad's handler, Vlonk. "Swallow the guard" is a game the toad likes to play, and Gullop has ordered Vlonk to let himself get swallowed whenever the toad wants to "play."

Vlonk and the toad are indifferent toward the characters. If the characters seem friendly, Vlonk asks them to mind the toad while he goes for a swim to wash the toad's saliva off his skin. If the characters agree to toad-sit, Vlonk returns 10 minutes later to resume his duties. During Vlonk's absence, the toad tries to swallow at least one of the characters. However, it can't reach anyone more than 5 feet away from the wooden post to which it is tethered.

### D18. Bavlorna's Cauldron

>>A bulbous, green-black cauldron with a thick lid sits above a bed of hot coals on six sturdy iron legs that protrude from its curved bottom like the extremities of a crab. A wooden ladle hangs from a lanyard looped around the lid's knob.
>>

Bavlorna's cauldron is 4 feet in diameter and 3 feet tall. The cauldron is hot to the touch, because it is being heated by the coals. The cauldron's lid is held shut by an *arcane lock* spell, the password for which is "spittlespew." If anyone tries to remove the lid without first speaking the password, the cauldron scuttles away; it has a walking speed of 30 feet and returns to its spot over the coals after 10 minutes.

If the cauldron scuttles away, a **magmin** emerges from within the pile of hot coals. It introduces itself as the coal tender and asks the characters, in Ignan, "You want in that cauldron?" He offers to give them the password in exchange for some dry wood (he loves the sound that dry wood makes when it burns). If the characters give him a bundle of dry wood (which can be obtained from the darklings in *area D10*), the magmin shares the password. The magmin lingers until the cauldron returns, at which point the magmin dives under the coals and disappears.

- **Animated Coals** If the characters attack the magmin, eight of the coals from the bed spring to life and come to the magmin's defense. See the "Animated Coals" section in the description of *area D4*.

***What's Cooking.*** Inside the cauldron is a bubbling, frothy, gray-black liquid that radiates an aura of transmutation magic under the scrutiny of a detect magic spell. Any creature that drinks a pint or more of the liquid is targeted by a *polymorph* spell (save DC 14) that lasts for 1 hour. The creature is transformed into either a **giant frog** (75 percent chance) or a **giant dragonfly** (25 percent chance; see *appendix C*).

***Unicorn Horn.*** If the *Story Tracker* indicates that the missing unicorn's horn is here, the characters can find it amid the coals. (Bavlorna kicked it into the coals accidentally after one of her clumsy lornlings dropped it.) The soot-stained horn is easy to spot once the cauldron scuttles out of the way, because it tumbles into view when the magmin appears.

### D19. Watch Tower
A wood plank path leads up to this location from the nearby dwellings (*areas D16* and *D17*).

>>A ten-foot-high, raised wooden platform stands atop a mound of mossy earth and mud. Two bullywugs laze at their guard post atop the platform, occasionally peering through a long spyglass mounted on a swivel.
>>
>>A frayed clothesline attached to one corner of the watch tower is festooned with patchwork garments. The line stretches out toward the nearby lake before disappearing in the fog.
>>

The mound on which the platform is built is 10 feet above water level at its highest point. The slippery slope around the platform is *difficult terrain*. No ladder or rope leads to the platform, since the bullywugs can simply leap to the top of the mound. The two **bullywugs** (neutral) stationed on the platform use the swiveling spyglass to keep an eye out for danger, though the device does not help them see through the thick fog.

***Clothesline.*** The clothesline attached to the watch tower leads to Bavlorna's cottage (*area D12*) and has a variety of frayed, patchwork garments draped over it. The line can support an additional 200 pounds before snapping.

## Bavlorna's Cottage
Bavlorna's cottage is heavily obscured by thick fog to anyone 20 or more feet away from it. Clotheslines hang from the cottage's four corners and stretch across Murky Lake to their anchor points at areas *D4*, *D11*, *D13*, and *D19*. Each line can support 200 pounds of added weight before snapping.

The cottage is a massive wooden edifice built on stilts, its floor 35 feet above the lake. It sits atop an well that extends up through the floor into area B1. A rickety wooden staircase with no railing rises from the lake, wrapping around the well as it climbs to a wooden trapdoor in the floor of area B1.

The cottage's physical features are as follows:

- **Ceilings and Rooftops** Unless otherwise noted, ceilings are 10 feet high on the lower levels and 20 feet high on the uppermost floor. The shingled rooftop is high-pitched, covered with moss, and too slippery to climb without magic or climbing gear.
- **Doors and Trapdoors** All doors in the cottage are closed but unlocked, except for the door to area B19. The cottage's doors and trapdoors are made of moldy wooden planks, many of which are swollen and warped; consequently, they often get stuck in their frames or refuse to close properly, though this has no effect on game play.
- **Floors and Stairs** Floors and staircases are made of mossy wooden planks that creak, groan, and bend underfoot. Crossing a floor or using a staircase without making noise requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check.
- **Light** If a location has light sources, the text says so. Otherwise, the area is unlit.
- **Walls and Windows** The cottage's walls are made of soft, mossy wood and don't burn easily due to the moisture trapped in them. Windows are hinged to be openable but are latched shut from the inside and covered with enough grime to render them opaque. A character can use an action to try to force open a latched window, doing so with a successful DC 8 Strength check. A character can use an action and thieves' tools to try to unlock a latched window from the outside, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity check.

> ##### Bavlorna's Lornlings
>Bavlorna's paranoia leads her to rely primarily on servants that she creates herself. The most common among them are her lornlings (use the **quickling** stat block in *appendix C*). These tiny creatures look like miniature versions of Bavlorna. They are quick and flit about the cottage at her bidding.
>

### Cottage Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of Bavlorna's cottage.

![[050-map-2.4-bavlornas-cottage-player.jpg|right|300]]
#### B1. Preservation Pool
This location is accessible through the cottage's trapdoor entrance that leads up from Murky Lake.

>>A recessed pool lined with moldy clay tiles takes up most of this large square room. Stagnant water fills the depression to a depth of one foot. Rising from the pool's center is the head of a stone well that gives off an unpleasant, pungent odor. In one corner of the pool stands a tall, dirty, freestanding mirror in an oval frame, and floating on the water is a large lily pad.
>>
>>Creaky wooden floorboards are arranged in a ten-foot-wide raised walkway around the pool. This walkway is crowded with shelves, tables, and stools in all shapes and styles. Almost every available surface is littered with stacks of dirty plates, scraps of food, and old junk. Dressing dummies are pushed together in one corner, and a wooden staircase spirals up from another corner. Five closed doors lead from the room.
>>

***Dress Dummies.*** Seven humanoid-shaped dressing dummies stand in the corner—four of Medium size and three of Small size. Six of them are adorned with Bavlorna's shoddy, home-stitched garments. The other one is bare except for an ugly, black pointed hat that is, in fact, a **darkmantle**. It attacks anyone other than Bavlorna who touches it. If it makes a successful melee attack against a creature that happens to be wearing a helm, a hat, or some other kind of headwear, the darkmantle grabs and removes the headwear and flees with it rather than dealing damage to the target or enveloping its head.

***Magic Mirror.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the freestanding mirror, which acts as a portal. Touching the reflective surface of the mirror while speaking the command word, "bandersnatch," causes the surface to become a swirling vortex of mist. A creature that steps into this vortex is instantly transported to the Hall of Illusions in the Witchlight Carnival (see chapter 1). In the Hall of Illusions, the portal resembles an oval doorway of swirling mist that remains active for 1 minute. While the portal is active, a creature in the Hall of Illusions can pass through it and reappear in front of the mirror or in the nearest unoccupied space. Once the portal closes, it can't be reopened except by touching the mirror's surface and speaking the password again.

Breaking the mirror renders it nonmagical and closes the portal instantly. The mirror is a Medium object with AC 13, 4 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

***Pool.*** Stairs lead down into the pool from one corner of the surrounding walkway. Bavlorna tries to bathe in the pool once a day to keep her skin from drying out and cracking, but the well that supplies the water has stopped working. Characters who peer into the well can see that it is filled with calm water almost to the brim. Bavlorna doesn't know it, but the cause of the faulty well is a 10-foot-high gelatinous cylinder (use the **gelatinous cube** stat block) that's blocking the normal flow of water. The creature's presence has also contaminated the water above it, rendering it mildly acidic—not enough to cause damage, but enough to make one's skin tingle uncomfortably. A character who experiences this tingling can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check, ascertain that something akin to a gelatinous cube has lodged itself in the well.

The gelatinous cylinder lurks 10 feet down inside the well and is invisible in the water. It attacks any creature and dissolves any organic material that comes in contact with it. If a creature lowers itself into the water, attacks the ooze from above, and then exits the well, the gelatinous cylinder squirms up the shaft in pursuit, emerging from the well and thus unplugging it. The cylinder is 10 feet high and 10 feet in diameter. When it is lured out of the well or killed, the flow of water resumes in a torrent, filling the pool to a depth of 3 feet in 1 minute.

***Treasure.*** The lily pad floating on the water is a magic item called a *bobbing lily pad* (see *appendix A*). Bavlorna is attuned to it currently.

#### B2. Taxidermy Workshop

>>A horse's head leers at you with glossy eyes, its lips drawn back from pointed yellow teeth. The head is affixed to a large, eight-limbed armature made of wicker and wire, situated so that it faces the doorway where you entered. Near it is a wooden crate.
>>
>>Flies buzz about this disordered room, landing occasionally on animal carcasses that lie strewn in small piles. On a low table rests an assortment of tools—saws, knives, scrapers, a hand-cranked drill, sewing thread and needles, and awls—around several taxidermic subjects in various stages of completion. A shelf that looks on the verge of collapse leans against the wall between two windows and bears the weight of dozens of stuffed horrors. Each one is an artless combination of two or more animals.
>>

This area is where Bavlorna stuffs dead creatures and stitches them together to create chimeric horrors.

***Crate.*** Bavlorna's name is scrawled on one side of the crate. Lifting the lid releases a harmless swarm of flies. The crate contains the carcass of a curled-up, eight-legged reptile with spikes running down its back. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check, a character can determine that it's the carcass of a basilisk.

***Worktable.*** Along with the tools and specimens, the table has a small box with drawers that contain glass eyes. One of the eyes is made of wood, and it belongs to Bavlorna's sister, **Skabatha Nightshade** (see *chapter 4*).

#### B3. Fabric Storage Room

>>Scraps of cloth and bundles of yarn are piled throughout this small room.
>>

This is Bavlorna's fabric storage closet, where she takes lost and forgotten garments and cuts them into lengths of cloth from which she creates her own clothes. Characters who search the room find two 1-foot-tall pincushions sewn into humanoid shapes. One of the pincushions is mounted on a tiny wooden rocking horse; the other has a pair of wooden wings. The pincushions represent Bavlorna's sisters, Skabatha and Endelyn.

#### B4. Rickety Stairs

>>A flight of stairs runs along the outside wall of the cottage, with wooden doors at the top and bottom of it. A rickety railing hugs the edge of the staircase, which looms above the foggy lake. A steady droning sound comes from a shadowed corner above the door at the top of the stairs.
>>

This outdoor stairway connects area B1 on the first floor with area B13 on the second floor, but the steps are in bad shape. A character who examines the stairs and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers that the second and third steps from the bottom are rotted and incapable of supporting much weight. If more than 40 pounds of weight is applied to either one, both steps give way. When that happens, any creature standing on them must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature stops short of falling through the gap. On a failed save, the creature plunges 35 feet into the 20-foot-deep lake surrounding the cottage, taking no damage. A character who falls into the lake while wearing heavy armor sinks to the bottom but can, on their turn, swim to the surface with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

***Wasp Nest.*** A 7-foot-long, 5-foot-wide wasp nest clings to a shadowy corner above the door at the top of the stairs, outside area B13. The nest is a Medium object with AC 11, 12 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It holds a **swarm of insects (wasps)** that is incapacitated and remains so until the nest is disturbed or damaged. Part of the nest overlaps the door, and opening the door disturbs the nest.

While the wasps are in the nest, any damage dealt to the nest applies to the swarm as well. Once it emerges from the nest, the swarm is hostile toward all other creatures on the stairs. The swarm pursues creatures that flee into the cottage, but not creatures that jump or fall into the lake.

#### B5. Trove of Lesser Goodies
The door to this room creaks loudly when opened.

>>A large cupboard stands alone in this dark room. Fine scrollwork frames the cupboard's two doors, which are bridged by a circular panel of dark wood. The panel is inlaid with a silver hourglass sigil.
>>

If **Sir Talavar** the faerie dragon was recaptured and brought here, he remains trapped in his cage, which hangs from a hook protruding from a wall next to the cupboard.

The cupboard is locked but can be unlocked by rotating the circular panel so that the hourglass sigil is turned upside down. Characters who examine the sigil can ascertain, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check, that it can be manipulated safely.

The inside of the cupboard is divided into rows of small compartments, each one stuffed with pouches or other tiny containers. One of the containers is a teacup-sized ceramic cauldron, inside which is a scrap of paper with the word "spittlespew" written on it in Common. (This is the password to open the cauldron in *area D18*.)

Bavlorna keeps various mementos and trinkets in the cupboard, including:

- Loose buttons of various shapes, colors, and materials
- Stray cutlery (all from different sets)
- Unopened love letters (not written or addressed to Bavlorna, but to long-dead people with whom Bavlorna has had dealings)
- Old, frayed, coiled-up belts
- Pressed flowers and loose dried petals
- A horseshoe
- Feathers from various birds
- A chipped teacup

#### B6. Balcony

>>This ten-foot-wide balcony runs almost the length of the cottage and is covered from end to end with living frogs. At each end of the balcony, attached to one corner of the cottage just beyond easy reach, is a clothesline draped with patchwork garments. The two lines stretch out over the lake and disappear into the thick fog.
>>

If anyone steps onto the balcony, the hundreds of harmless **frogs** on the balcony croak in unison, alerting Bavlorna wherever she happens to be in the cottage. If one or more of the frogs are killed, the rest leap into the lake below.

If she hears the croaking frogs, Bavlorna sends three of her lornlings (use the **quickling** stat block in *appendix C*) to investigate and report back to her. They avoid combat.

#### B7. Hallway
The spiral staircase in area B1 leads up to this hallway on the second floor.

>>The walls of this dank hallway are covered with scores of portraits depicting grumpy, sad, frightened, and angry people. The figures include humans, elves, halflings, bullywugs, and goblins, among others. The portraits are rendered in a variety of mediums, including paintings, etchings, and sketches. All are displayed in gaudy, gilded frames.
>>
>>A framed oval mirror two feet wide and five feet tall hangs in the middle of one wall.
>>

The hall has closed doors leading to areas B8, B10, and B16.

***Oval Mirror and Secret Door.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around this mirror. The mirror's frame is stuck to the wall with *sovereign glue*, and the mirror can't be removed without destroying it. The mirror alters the reflection of any creature that gazes into it, rendering the reflection bereft of expression or emotion, except if a creature smiles into the mirror. In that case, the creature's reflection also smiles, and a secret door in the wall holding the mirror swings inward, revealing a hidden passage (area B9).

Any character who examines the wall behind the mirror and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check sees the edges of the secret door, which can also be forced open with a *knock* spell or similar magic. Bavlorna can open the secret door without having to smile or use magic.

#### B8. Guest Room
This is a dusty, uncluttered room. Several shadow boxes hang on the wall to either side of a modest bed with moldering linens. Most of the shadow boxes contain mummified pixies pinned to boards like a collection of butterflies. The glass on one of the shadow boxes has been broken, and its contents are missing.

#### B9. Secret Passage
Bavlorna has forgotten about this secret passage, which connects areas B7 and B10.

>>A moldy scent hangs in the air in this dark, L-shaped hallway.
>>

The secret door leading to area B7 is easily spotted from this side but requires a *knock* spell or similar magic to open. Only Bavlorna can open the secret door without using magic.

***Shrinking Effect.*** Creatures and objects in the hallway magically shrink in size as they get closer to area B10. They are normal size at the end of the hall closest to area B7, one-half their normal size at the bend in the hallway, and one-twentieth their normal size at the end of the hall closest to area B10. Shrunken creatures have disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and their weapons deal 1d4 less damage at one-half to one-tenth size, or 2d6 less damage at smaller than one-tenth size (minimum damage of 1 in either case).

One minute after a creature or an object leaves the tunnel, the shrinking effect on it ends, whereupon it returns to its normal size.

***Tiny Door.*** A solid wall seems to block access to area B10, but closer inspection reveals a 2-inch-wide, 4-inch-tall mouse hole at the base of the wall. This mouse hole is blocked by a tiny wooden door that is barred on this side by a steel needle. Lifting the needle allows the tiny door to be pulled open easily, revealing a moldy stretch of floor underneath the potion cabinet that stands against the wall in area B10.

***Development.*** Shrunken creatures that pass through the tiny door have 1 minute to move out from under the cabinet into area B10 before they return to their normal size. If a creature is under the cabinet when it enlarges to Small or Medium size, it is pinned underneath the cabinet. While pinned in this way, the creature is prone and restrained. On each of its turns, it can use an action to try to free itself, doing so with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### B10. Study

>>Two creatures are having a conversation over tea in the middle of this room. The first figure is seated in a timeworn armchair. She is a tall, lean woman of gray complexion, dressed in black with a wide-brimmed hat obscuring her eyes. The other figure is a toad-like creature with bulging eyes and cracked skin. It is clad in a shapeless garment and sits on one end of a love seat with its legs pulled up beneath it. Flies flit into and out of its mouth, which hangs agape when it isn't speaking. Two tiny versions of the creature cling to it like pets.
>>
>>The room is filthy. Dirty dishes and bits of discarded food lie everywhere. The furniture was perhaps once of fine quality, but now stains of mysterious origin mottle every surface, and the upholstery has been patched numerous times. Set with its back to the wall in one corner is a hulking wooden cabinet. Sturdy legs support the bottom of the cabinet six inches above the floor. A decrepit wooden staircase climbs up the wall in another corner.
>>

The toad-like creature is **Bavlorna Blightstraw** (see appendix B), and she is joined by two of her lornlings (use the **quickling** stat block in *appendix C*). Bavlorna has not submerged herself in her preservation pool in some time, and her skin is brittle and cracked. If she has been warned about intruders, Bavlorna fixes her bulging eyes on the characters as they come into view:

>>The toad-like creature speaks to you in a low croaking voice. "What act of desperation compels you to enter my home, little darlings?"
>>

See "Dealing with Bavlorna" below for advice on how to run an encounter with the hag, keeping in mind the rules of hospitality, ownership, and reciprocity to which she adheres (see "Rules of Conduct" earlier in the chapter).

Bavlorna has an iron key tucked in one of the pockets of her garment; this key unlocks the door to area B19.

The tall, slender figure in black is Charm, a **darkling elder** (see appendix C) who works for **Endelyn Moongrave** as a thief but poses as a traveling merchant. When the characters arrive, Charm is gossiping with Bavlorna about the hag's sisters, Endelyn and Skabatha. The conversation is a distraction, buying time for Charm's shadow to perpetrate a heist in area B19. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher notice that the black-clad figure doesn't cast a shadow. This is not a trait that darklings possess, but rather the result of Endelyn's using her *scissors of shadow snipping* (see *appendix A*) to cut loose Charm's shadow and transform it into a separate creature. See *chapter 4* for more information on Endelyn and her magic scissors.

![[051-02-009.charm.png|right|300]]

***Dealing with Bavlorna.*** Before she'll agree to help the characters in any way, Bavlorna demands that they complete the following three chores:

- **Fix the Preservation Pool** Bavlorna's preservation pool (see area B1) won't fill with water. It seems the well that supplies it is plugged. Bavlorna wants the characters to fix the problem. (If the characters have already defeated the creature that was plugging the well, she considers this chore complete.)

***Find the Missing Book.*** Bavlorna's Big Book of Bad Blood has gone missing. It contains copious notes on everyone who has wronged her. She assumes the book hasn't been taken far and wants the characters to search Downfall for it. (The book is currently in the hands of Gullop XIX, the bullywug king in *area D6*. If the characters have already dealt with Gullop and are returning the book to Bavlorna, she considers this chore complete.)

- **Pick Up a Package** Bavlorna fancies herself an expert in taxidermy, and a bullywug hunter has filled a crate with animal carcasses for Bavlorna to stuff. The crate can be found in one of the bullywug dwellings (*area D16*), and Bavlorna wants it brought to her.

When all three chores are complete, Bavlorna insists on taking a short rest in her preservation pool to moisten her skin. Only then will she consider bargaining with the characters.

While the characters are busy performing one or more of Bavlorna's unfinished chores, the darkling elder and her elusive shadow find what they were after and return to their balloon (*area D10*). The darklings then unmoor their balloon and drift away toward Yon. If the darklings escape, the characters might encounter them again in *chapter 4*.

If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook and the *Story Tracker* indicates that Bavlorna has one or more things in her possession that the characters desire, she agrees to give up these items on one condition: she wants the characters to steal a portrait of her older sister, Skabatha, and deliver it to Bavlorna's cottage within eight days. Bavlorna provides three pieces of information before spitting into her hand and requiring the characters to shake it, thus sealing the bargain:

- Loomlurch is a giant, hollowed-out tree located deep in the forest of Thither. Skabatha uses it as a lair.
- Skabatha's portrait is displayed in a circular room in the heart of Loomlurch, alongside portraits of her three sisters: Bavlorna, Endelyn, and Tasha. (Bavlorna won't add anything about Tasha if the characters press for more information about her.)
- To reach Thither, the characters need a guide. There's a scarecrow in Downfall who knows the way (she can't remember the scarecrow's name).

If Skabatha's portrait is brought to Bavlorna on time, the hag fulfills her end of the bargain. If the characters fail to deliver Skabatha's portrait within the agreed-upon time, each character who agreed to the bargain must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the character loses one cherished possession (chosen by you). This possession disappears and is not regained until the curse ends. Bavlorna can end the curse on a character (no action required), as can any spell that ends a curse.

If the characters were drawn to Prismeer by the "Warlock's Quest" adventure hook, they can strike a different bargain with Bavlorna, but she won't deal with anyone who claims to be searching for a way to help Zybilna and thereby weaken the Hourglass Coven. First and foremost, Bavlorna wants Skabatha's portrait (with the same time restrictions as the "Lost Things" bargain above) and is willing to trade for it. Once she has the portrait, her greed might focus on something else in Skabatha's possession, at your discretion.

If Bavlorna feels threatened, or if a fight turns against her, she flees to Thither on her *bobbing lily pad* (in area B1) and reluctantly takes refuge with her older sister, Skabatha (see *chapter 3* for details).

If she has no option but to fight, Bavlorna doesn't hesitate to swallow one of the characters. If she is later forced to regurgitate the character, she also expels a small iron key. The key unlocks the potion cabinet in this room.

***Potion Cabinet.*** The cabinet in the corner is made of wood that is still covered with bark and patches of moss. There's a lock in the middle of the right panel, but it's obscured beneath hanging moss. (Bavlorna swallowed the key for safekeeping but can regurgitate it as needed.) A character can use an action and thieves' tools to try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

The cabinet contains two shelves:

- The bottom shelf holds three magic potions with labels in Elvish: a *potion of diminution* labeled "Shrink," a *potion of growth* labeled "Grow," and a *potion of invisibility* labeled "Vanish."
- The top shelf holds a stuffed cat that shambles to life when the cabinet is opened. The cat formerly belonged to Bavlorna's sister, Endelyn. (She suspects Bavlorna stole the cat, but she has no proof.) The cat, **Gloam**, is hostile toward all creatures except Bavlorna. It uses the **cat** stat block, except it is an Undead, has immunity to poison damage, and is immune to exhaustion and the poisoned condition. On its first turn in combat or when it is reduced to 0 hit points, the cat expels a cloud of dust that acts as *dust of sneezing and choking*.

***Tiny Door.*** Characters who look underneath the potion cabinet see a tiny door built into a 2-inch-wide, 4-inch-tall mouse hole at the base of the wall. The door is barred on the other side, but a character can use an action to try to force open the door, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength check. The door opens into a secret passage (area B9).

#### B11. Aviary

>>Slivers of light enter through cracks in the shutters that cover three tall windows. The light reveals the shapes of several pedestals. On each one rests an object with a patchwork cloth draped over it. Wilting ferns in crumbling clay pots give the room its earthy smell. The floor is covered in a layer of straw.
>>

This is Bavlorna's aviary, where she uses taxidermy birds to send and receive messages from her coven sisters. Outside two of the room's windows are small wooden balconies, each one corresponding to a sister. The word "Thither" is scrawled above the window to the east balcony, while the word "Yon" is scrawled above the window to the north balcony. Messages meant for a particular sister are sent from the corresponding balcony.

On the pedestals are cages that hold seven birds, each of which has the head of one avian species and the body of another. They squawk and flutter about anxiously if the drapes covering their cages are removed. Each bird uses the **hawk** stat block, except it is an Undead, has immunity to poison damage, and is immune to exhaustion and the poisoned condition.

#### B12. Meat Locker
The door to this room is closed and cold to the touch.

>>This room is freezing. Chunks of frozen meat dangle from the ceiling on hooks and chains. Along the walls, more meat is stacked in piles on metal racks.
>>
>>A small, frost-covered wooden coffer sits in the middle of the floor. The cold seems to be radiating from it.
>>

The cold isn't likely to harm the characters unless they spend an hour or more in the room, in which case the rules for *extreme cold* apply (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

The wooden coffer is frozen shut but can be pried open with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. This check is made with advantage if a crowbar or similar tool is used. The coffer contains the still-beating heart of an elf named Octavian Meliamne (see *area D14*). If the heart is removed from the coffer or the room, the spell that cools the room is broken, and everything in the room begins to thaw as the room slowly warms up.

#### B13. Kitchen
Any character who listens at one of the doors hears a loud ruckus coming from inside.

>>In this gore-spattered kitchen, a stout figure with a stained apron, iron boots, a crimson cap, and a bloody meat cleaver chases a pair of vultures around a butcher's block while the squawking birds fight over a scrap of meat.
>>

The butcher's block is a slab of blood-encrusted wood that occupies the middle of the kitchen. Dirty cutlery and mismatched plates and pots balance in precarious piles in and around a wooden wash basin.

The small figure is a female **redcap** (see *appendix C*) named Bloody Toes. She was carving up some meat when two **vultures** flew in through the door to the balcony (area B14). The characters' presence doesn't alarm or bother her. In fact, she asks the characters for help in getting rid of the vultures.

Bloody Toes serves Bavlorna as a chef and butcher. The hag has forbidden the redcap from attacking or murdering guests, so Bloody Toes fights only in self-defense. The redcap despises everyone and everything, but she hates Bavlorna most of all. If the characters claim to be at odds with Bavlorna, the redcap reveals that Bavlorna has a weakness: she is allergic to seeing anyone run widdershins (in tight counterclockwise circles) near her. Such a sight causes the hag to sneeze uncontrollably.

#### B14. Cages
If the characters are offered to Bavlorna as prisoners, they are locked up here.

>>Three large iron cages hang from wooden beams that extend out from this balcony over the lake below. Trapped inside one of the cages is a smiling satyr. "Hello there!" he says.
>>

These iron cages are used to store soon-to-be-butchered meat. Each cage can hold up to two Medium creatures, and each beam can be hoisted up over the balcony using a crank that is attached to the railing. A character can use an action to try to bend the bars of a cage, doing so with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check, or use thieves' tools to try to pick a cage's lock, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

The **satyr**, Vansel, is not wearing any clothes. Harengon brigands stole his clothes while he was bathing. When he chased them, he ended up trapped in a net and was brought to Bavlorna. He's in good spirits despite his current situation, believing everything will work out and he'll have quite a story to tell afterward. If the characters release him, he searches the kitchen (area B13) for something to wear and finds a grease-stained tablecloth he can use as a robe. He also finds a bottle of wine and guzzles it down. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Vansel.

***Treasure.*** Vansel stays close to his rescuers until he's clear of Bavlorna's cottage, at which point he thanks the characters and bids them adieu. Then, suddenly remembering the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" earlier in the chapter), he picks up a stick, whispers to it, and hands it to one of the characters. If a character accepts the gift, a tiny flower blooms at one end of the stick. Until this flower wilts and falls off 24 hours later, the stick has the properties of a *stone of good luck* that doesn't require attunement.

#### B15. Pantry
This room contains dozens of pickling jars on wooden racks. Most of the jars are filled with pig snouts, toads, small birds, onions, mushrooms, and other cooking ingredients. One of the jars contains a **campestri** (see *appendix C*) that bursts into song if released.

#### B16. Dining Room

>>This room has two exits. Above each door, mounted on a wooden plaque, is a severed goblin head with its mouth agape. Other furnishings include a sideboard, two cupboards with doors made of wood-framed glass, and a large banquet table covered with plates of half-eaten food and a swarm of feasting flies. A chandelier hangs above the table, its tallow candles filling the room with dim, flickering light. Six mismatched chairs flank the table—three chairs per side.
>>

Two of Bavlorna's lornlings (use the **quickling** stat block in *appendix C*) hide in the mouths of the severed goblin heads mounted above the doors. Any character who peers into one of these gaping mouths spots the lornling hidden in it. The lornling stares back at the character but doesn't attack.

These lornlings know that Bavlorna has a magic mirror (in area B1) that can transport creatures to the Witchlight Carnival, and they trade this information in exchange for their lives. Each of them has overheard Bavlorna speak the mirror's command word ("bandersnatch"), but they can't remember or pronounce the word accurately. Instead, they say phrases such as, "blunder scratch," "bangle stash," "banter catch," "bandy crasher," "bumble snatch," and "babble scrabble."

#### B17. Hooch Distillery

>>A contraption made of entangled copper tubes connects to a pot-bellied boiler and a dozen cylindrical containers, which in turn sprout even more tubes that feed into buckets. Barrels are clustered in the southeast corner, and a worktable in one corner of the room has bits of copper and metalworking tools strewn across it. Light filters in through the green, diamond-shaped panes of glass set into the window.
>>

Bavlorna distills her supply of mushroom-based alcohol here. The complex network of copper tubes takes up much of the room. Six buckets collect the stinking alcohol. The barrels are filled with this homemade brew, and each one weighs 250 pounds.

The still's structural integrity is on the brink of failure. Any creature that disturbs the distillery must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or knock something loose or out of alignment. On a failed save, roll a d8. On a 1, the still explodes, blowing out the glass window but leaving the barrels intact. When the explosion occurs, each creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### B18. Bavlorna's Bedroom
The stairs in area B10 lead up into this room.

>>A ball of light bobs above the rafters, casting shadows over this room, in which the owner's messy habits are on full display. Rumpled and moldering rugs share floor space with food scraps, stacks of dirty dishes, and tipped-over clay pots whose plants have long since died.
>>
>>A bed that occupies one corner of the room has a pile of straw in place of a mattress. In the opposite corner stands a squat chest of drawers with a watering can resting atop it. The only other furnishing of note is a stocky wooden chest with a sturdy iron padlock. It sits in another corner between two closed doors.
>>

The ball of light floating near the 20-foot-high ceiling is a **will-o'-wisp**, which drifts down toward the characters if they move into the room. It attacks only if they try to remove the chest or any of its contents from the room without first opening the chest using the proper key (see "Thirsty Plants" and "Treasure" below). If reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, the will-o'-wisp turns invisible and tries to flee; if it escapes, it flies to Bavlorna and warns her about the intruders in her bedchamber.

***Chest of Drawers.*** This chest contains folded dresses and other garments that Bavlorna wears occasionally. None of them were made for her, but she has adjusted them to fit her toadish form. All of the garments are discolored from age and neglect.

The watering can on the chest is rusty and contains a gallon of water.

***East Door.*** This door leads to Bavlorna's trove of greater goodies (area B19), where she keeps her most prized items.

***South Door.*** This door leads to a small, empty balcony that looks out over Murky Lake (*area D7*).

***Thirsty Plants.*** There are four dead plants in tipped-over pots. Each one is a **twig blight** with a speed of 0 feet because it is rooted to its pot. The twig blights are thirsty but unable to reach the watering can resting on the chest of drawers. If the characters help the twig blights by standing them upright and watering them, one of them pulls a black-enameled iron key out of the dirt in its pot and gives it to the characters. This key unlocks the wooden chest in this room (see "Treasure" below).

***Treasure.*** The padlocked chest has clawed iron feet and the initials B.B. crudely carved into its lid. It takes 1 minute and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to pick the padlock. On a check that fails by 5 or more, or if the lock is smashed off, the chest transforms into a Small animated object and attacks whoever tried to open it (see the *animate objects* spell for its statistics).

The chest contains the following items:

- A 12-inch-tall marionette that Bavlorna stole from her sister, Endelyn. It has faces on opposite sides of its head. One face is a moon, and the other is a sun. As an art object, the marionette is worth 25 gp.
- An unpunched ticket from the Witchlight Carnival. The ticket is signed by Isolde, the carnival's original owner.
- Three *spell scrolls* of *identify* tied together with a lute string.

#### B19. Bavlorna's Hoard
The door to this room is locked, and Bavlorna has the key on her person. The characters might have a key as well, if they acquired one from the awakened tree on Telemy Hill or Bavlorna. As an action, a character using thieves' tools can try to pick the door's lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Alternatively, a character can use an action to try to break down the door, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check.

>>This musty room looks like a miser's attic. Lying in tall heaps are discarded blankets, quilts, cushions, and clothing of all shapes and sizes, not to mention musical instruments, toys, dolls, jewelry boxes, flower vases, child-sized caskets, and broken furniture.
>>
>>Among the heaps of junk are a few oddities, including a stag's skull hanging on one wall, a white porcelain jar with chicken legs standing on a table, a fancy helmet placed on the faceless head of a wooden mannequin, and a five-foot-long bronze statue of a giant frog squatting in a corner, its mouth agape and filled with impenetrable darkness. A weak croaking sound calls your attention to a tiny, shriveled figure lying on the floor. It lets out one final gasp before dying.
>>

The tiny figure is one of Bavlorna's lornlings. It was killed by the **shadow** of the darkling elder in area B10. The shadow has detached from the darkling and roams freely. If the characters arrive here while Bavlorna is entertaining the darkling elder, they interrupt a heist being carried out by the shadow:

>>A shape moves in the gloom—a dark humanoid figure lurking among the junk. It clutches a large spool of thread in one hand as it heads for the door.
>>

The shadow is a Fey, not an Undead. It tries to slip past the characters into area B18, using its Amorphous trait to slip underneath the door if a character closes it. It then moves onto the balcony in that area and jumps in the lake, where it waits to rejoin the darkling elder. The shadow doesn't attack, and it drops the spool of thread if it can't escape with it. The spool, unlike the shadow, is too wide to fit under the door.

Bavlorna's sister, **Endelyn Moongrave**, covets the spool of thread and has sent Charm to steal it. The thread is the color of frustration and self-doubt, as perceived by the beholder (meaning that each creature sees the thread's color as the hue it associates most with such emotions), and it confers these feelings on anyone who wears garments sewn with it. Even touching the thread evokes these negative emotions.

***Junk.*** Bavlorna's "treasure hoard" consists of worthless junk and the following special objects:

- A stag's skull hangs on a wall hook 5 feet above the floor. This skull is Clapperclaw's missing head (see area D5 for details).
- A porcelain jar made of varnished white clay rests on a wooden table. The jar has legs that have been painted to look like the legs of a chicken. Inside the jar are two broken pieces of a wishbone. If the characters touch the two pieces together, they hear Bavlorna's voice in their heads say, "Skabatha forgets the first creature she sees when she wakes up, although her memory of it returns each night when she sleeps. A creature forgotten by Skabatha in this manner is invisible to her."
- A wooden mannequin wears a *helm of telepathy*. If the helm is removed from the mannequin, the mannequin animates and tries to get the helm back by attacking whoever has it. The mannequin uses the **animated armor** stat block but has AC 15. If it reacquires the helm, the mannequin dons the helm and reverts to its inanimate state until the helm is removed again. Placing a different piece of headgear on its bare head has the effect of rendering the mannequin inanimate permanently.

***Bronze Frog Statue.*** Magical darkness fills the inside of this statue's gaping mouth, allowing no light to enter. The mouth leads to an extradimensional space. If a character reaches into the statue's mouth, read the following boxed text, addressing that character's player:

>>Your limb disappears into the darkness, and it feels as though your fingers were pushing through cool mud with eels swimming through it.
>>

To grab hold of something and pull it from the statue's mouth, a character must say the name of what they desire. If the desired thing is in the extradimensional space, it materializes in the character's hand. If you're using the "Lost Things" adventure hook and Bavlorna has turned one or more of the characters' long-lost possessions into magic items, these items can be retrieved from the statue's extradimensional space.

The bronze frog statue weighs 750 pounds and is a Medium object with AC 19, 32 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the statue is destroyed, the extradimensional space collapses, and everything once contained there becomes lost in the Astral Plane.

![[052-02-010.treasures.png|right|300]]

***Development.*** If the characters follow Charm's shadow on its escape attempt, it leads them to the stairs under Bavlorna's cottage, where it waits briefly. When Charm leaves Bavlorna's cottage, the darkling elder and her shadow make a beeline to their balloon (*area D10*) and depart Downfall with all haste, whether the shadow's heist succeeded or not.

If Charm escapes with the spool of thread, the characters can use it as an enticement in their negotiations with Bavlorna, offering to retrieve it and trade it to her for something in return.

If the characters thwart Charm's shadow and prevent the darkling elder's escape, Bavlorna attacks the darkling elder and tries to swallow her. Then, adhering to the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" earlier in the chapter), Bavlorna agrees to negotiate with the characters even if they have not yet performed any chores for her.

## From Hither to Thither
The characters might travel to Thither to fulfill the terms of a bargain they struck with Bavlorna, in which case the hag grants them permission to use the balloon in *area D2*. (If that balloon was destroyed, an undamaged one just like it arrives in Downfall, piloted by a **bullywug knight** named Dumphrey Frogart.) Either Dumphrey or Morgort is happy to serve as a balloon pilot, though the bullywug parts company with the characters once they are safely delivered to Thither.

To reach *Thither*, the characters need **Clapperclaw the scarecrow** (see *area D5*) to guide them. If Clapperclaw is unable or unwilling to help the characters, substitute another helpful creature, such as Morgort the bullywug knight or Vansel the satyr.

# Thither
Thither is a sprawling fey woodland with a decaying core. With each passing day, Granny Nightshade's presence eats away at the forest's trees and taints its denizens. The rot worsens the closer one gets to Loomlurch, Granny Nightshade's lair.

![[053-03-001.chapter-splash.jpg|right|300]]

## Running This Chapter
In this chapter, the characters explore the forests of Thither. They could be searching for their lost things or questing for a means to overthrow the Hourglass Coven. Deep in the forest, they can confront Granny Nightshade in her lair.

Before your first game session in Thither, follow these steps to help make the players' experience as entertaining as possible:

- Thither is ruled by **Skabatha Nightshade**, also known as Granny Nightshade. Read her description and skim her stat block in appendix B.
- Read this chapter in its entirety, and reacquaint yourself with the "Prismeer Overview" in *chapter 2*.
- Look over the *map* of Thither. Locations marked on the map are described later in this chapter.

### Lost Things in Thither
If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook, check the *Story Tracker* to see if **Skabatha Nightshade** has anything the characters want to reclaim. When the characters enter Thither, anyone who had something stolen by Skabatha gets the nagging sensation that it is somewhere in this realm, though the character doesn't know where. The feeling fades when the character either regains what was lost or leaves Thither without recovering it. To find what they've lost, the characters must travel to *Loomlurch*. Objects that Granny Nightshade created using things she stole from the characters can be found in her dollhouse (see area L16).

### Navigating Thither
Using the map of Thither as a reference, describe what the characters see as they forge their own path through the splinter-realm. Named locations on the map are described later in the chapter.

Shortly after arriving in Thither, the characters come upon a cave that is the home of a miser who spins gold into magic items. The miser, Nib, can provide directions to other locations in Thither. As the characters make their way through Thither's ancient forest, they might find a fairy ring or a wanted poster (see "Features of Thither") or have a random encounter (see "Arrival in Thither").

At Little Oak, the characters meet the Getaway Gang, a gaggle of lost children led by a rapscallion named Will of the Feywild. The Getaway Gang can teach the characters how to reach Wayward Pool, an idyllic lake protected by a unicorn named Lamorna, who knows important information about Zybilna's fall and explains the importance of finding the horn that belongs to her lost mate, Elidon.

Characters who have business or grievances with the perfidious Granny Nightshade can venture to Loomlurch (an enormous, hollowed-out tree that houses the hag's workshop) and seek her out. A bargain they struck with **Bavlorna Blightstraw** in *chapter 2* might also require the characters to pay Loomlurch a visit.

#### Guide from Thither to Yon
Squirt, an animated oilcan, can guide characters from Thither to Yon and back to Thither. Squirt resides at Little Oak (see "Locations in Thither"). If you choose not to run the Little Oak encounter, you can place Squirt in another location that the characters are likely to visit.

## Features of Thither
The following physical features can be found across the realm of Thither.

![[055-map-3.1-thither-player.jpg|right|300]]
### Fairy Rings
When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, the forests of Thither were home to a host of fairy rings that functioned as fey crossings to different worlds in the Material Plane. Granny Nightshade has corrupted as many of the rings as she could find, making them dangerous to visitors.

Fairy rings are depicted on the map of Thither. Each ring is a 20-foot-diameter circle of colorful, 6-inch-tall toadstools located in a small clearing protected by the thick forest canopy. It radiates an aura of conjuration magic when scrutinized with a *detect magic* spell.

To determine whether a fairy ring is uncorrupted or corrupted, roll a d8. On a roll of 3 or higher, the fairy ring is uncorrupted; otherwise, it is corrupted.

![[056-03-002.png|right|300]]

#### Uncorrupted Fairy Rings
Roll a d8 when the characters come across an uncorrupted fairy ring. On a roll of 1 or 2, there are no creatures in the ring's vicinity. On a roll of 3 or higher, the ring has a **swarm of campestris** (see *appendix C*) singing and dancing inside it. Using body language, these cute, mushroom-like creatures urge the characters to join in their reverie. Any character who does so can make a DC 12 Charisma (Performance) check, gaining the benefit of a *true seeing* spell that lasts for 24 hours on a successful check (no effect on a failure). The campestris aren't clever enough to answer complex questions about Thither or offer reliable directions, and they speak by mimicking words they can hear.

The campestris' love for singing is obvious. Any character who tries to teach them a new song can make a DC 13 Charisma (Performance) check. On a successful check, the campestris adopt the song into their routine and bestow a *charm of heroism* (see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) on the character responsible. The campestris in any given fairy ring can bestow this charm once only. Check the *Story Tracker*: any character who received singing lessons from Palasha the mermaid in chapter 1 has advantage on this check.

***Activating the Fey Crossing.*** To use an uncorrupted fairy ring as a fey crossing, a creature must hold a wand or a stick of wood above its head and run in a circle counterclockwise while saying, "Three turns widdershins, and off we go!" If the creature performing this act is a Fey or has fey ancestry, its effort transports all creatures inside the fairy ring to a remote location on a Material Plane world of your choice. They might arrive inside a similar fairy ring that is hidden in an elven tomb or inside the tumbled-down ruin of an ancient tower, for example. If the creature holding the wand and running widdershins is neither a Fey nor of fey ancestry, the fey crossing activates only if exactly eight creatures are inside the ring.

The fey crossing works both ways, allowing travel to and from Thither. Returning to Thither, however, might require fulfilling a different set of conditions. For example, the fey crossing on the Material Plane side might operate only at twilight or on nights of the full moon, and it might require an orb instead of a wand or a stick.

Characters can plumb the depths of their memories and, with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check, recall enough folklore about fairy rings to know what must be done to activate these particular fey crossings.

#### Corrupted Fairy Rings
A corrupted fairy ring has no campestris singing and dancing inside it. Instead, Granny Nightshade has cast *awaken* spells on the 3d8 + 60 toadstools that form the ring, giving each of them the ability to speak Common. These awakened toadstools are mocking and rude toward visitors not accompanied by Granny Nightshade, and they move away from one another, breaking the ring, whenever someone other than the hag tries to use it as a fey crossing, rendering it unusable. Each awakened toadstool has AC 7, 1 hit point, no effective attacks, an Intelligence score of 10, and other ability scores of 1. Killing more than half of a ring's toadstools renders the ring unusable.

### Wanted Posters
Granny Nightshade has attached wanted posters to trees throughout Thither, offering rewards for the capture of her nemesis, Will of the Feywild (see "Locations in Thither"). Each poster consists of a portrait of the boy drawn in ink, above which are the following words in the Elvish script:

>*Wanted: Will of the Feywild*!
>

Each poster promises a different reward for Will's capture. Whenever you want the characters to find such a poster, or when the text calls for it, roll on the Wanted Posters table to determine which poster the characters have just discovered and what it offers as a reward. If you get the same result as a previous discovery, either roll again or choose an unused entry from the table.

##### Wanted Posters
| d8 | Offer | Reward |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | "This sorry wretch has stolen from me! Deliver him to me alive and unharmed, and I'll give you back ten years of your youth." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a yellow rose. As long as this rose remains unwilted and in the character's possession, the character relives the first ten years of their life as a vivid dream whenever they finish a long rest. After 8 days, the rose wilts and loses this magical property. |
| 2 | "This little troublemaker belongs to me. Bring him home alive and unharmed, and you'll win the heart of one you love." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a box containing the eviscerated heart of someone they love. This special someone can't be another party member, but it could be a family member or an old flame. The identity of this individual is known to Granny Nightshade, but she prefers not to divulge it. |
| 3 | "Bring me this imp alive and unharmed, and I'll bury you up to your neck in silver." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a silver ring, which disappears when the character touches it. The instant the ring disappears, the character becomes encased in a silver ingot (no saving throw allowed), with only the character's head visible. The character is unable to move from the neck down while encased in the ingot. With 12 hours of work, a creature using mason's tools can free the character from the ingot. The character can also use a *misty step* spell (or some other magic that doesn't require material or somatic components) to teleport out of the ingot. The silver disappears when the character is no longer trapped in it. |
| 4 | "Bring this wisp of a thief to me alive and unharmed, and I'll ensure that no sword can ever break your skin." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a stone ring, which disappears when the character touches it. The instant the ring disappears, the character is petrified (no saving throw allowed). |
| 5 | "Deliver this rascal alive and unharmed. As payment, I offer you the power to bring the dead back to life." | Granny Nightshade gives the character an 11-inch-long bone wand. When the character touches the wand to the corpse of a dead Humanoid, the wand turns to dust as the corpse transforms into a **zombie** with vague recollections of its past life. |
| 6 | "This rapscallion vexes me. Deliver him to me alive and unharmed, and I'll curse one creature whom you name." | The instant the character identifies the target of the curse, a *bestow curse* spell affects that creature (no saving throw allowed). Granny Nightshade does not have to see or touch the target for the spell to take effect, and the target can be any creature, including Granny Nightshade herself. |
| 7 | "How dare this ragamuffin defy me? Bring him to me alive and unharmed, and I'll grant you a loyal servant." | Granny Nightshade gives the character a friendly **frog** companion that has an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak and understand Common. |
| 8 | "Special offer! Bring this impetuous brat to me, and you can claim one item of your choice from my workshop." | Granny Nightshade is true to her word: the character can claim any one object from her workshop they can see or identify by name. The hag either fetches the item herself or commands a servant to do so. |

After delivering Will to Granny Nightshade, a character can choose to redeem one of these posters, whereupon the hag must give that character the poster's promised reward. A character need not collect the reward immediately; a poster can be redeemed at any time as long as Will remains in the hag's custody. Trading a poster for its promised reward constitutes a fey pact, the terms of which are enforced by the magic of the Feywild. A character can collect multiple posters, but only one poster per character can be redeemed. Granny Nightshade is not obligated to give a reward to any character who doesn't hand her a poster. She must accept a poster that is handed to her; when she does, the poster vanishes in a puff of smoke, and the hag must offer the promised reward to the character immediately. In most cases, the reward is a creature or object that is magically delivered into Granny Nightshade's custody when the poster vanishes. (Exceptions are noted in the Rewards column of the Wanted Posters table.) Whether the character chooses to accept the reward at that point is up to them, but offering the reward is enough to free Granny Nightshade from her obligation.

Granny Nightshade has no sympathy for characters who don't like the rewards she bestows, and she offers no way of undoing the rewards' magical effects.

## Arrival in Thither
When the adventurers first arrive in Thither, read:

>>The mists part to reveal a primeval forest. A fragrant breeze wafts between the enormous trees, sending motes of pollen dancing into the air. Patches of sunlight kiss the forest floor, and the sweet melody of birdsong echoes all around.
>>

Their guide leads the characters to Nib's Cave, the location of which is shown on the map of Thither. Along the way, the characters might have a random encounter, at your discretion (see "Random Encounters in Thither" below).

### Random Encounters in Thither
Roll for a random encounter whenever you feel it is appropriate; for example, you might decide to stage a random encounter while the characters are traveling toward a location marked on the map of Thither or when they first arrive at a particular landmark.

To determine what the characters encounter, roll a d8 and consult the Random Encounters in Thither table. Several of the random encounters described below are with specific named creatures and therefore aren't likely to happen more than once unless the characters revisit familiar ground. If you roll on the table, get the same result as on a previous roll, and don't like the repetition, choose a different encounter that you think would be fun.

##### Random Encounters in Thither
| d8 | Encounter |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Blink dogs |
| 2 | Buttered campestri |
| 3 | Centaur |
| 4 | Doomed dryad |
| 5 | Grandfather tree |
| 6 | Jabberwock's trail |
| 7 | Owlbear and chariot |
| 8 | Pixies |

#### Blink Dogs
The characters spot 1d6 + 2 **blink dogs** 60 feet ahead of them. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher can see that the dogs are surrounding a crudely dug hole in the ground. The characters must get within 5 feet of the hole to see that it's a shallow grave containing the body of a dead blink dog laid out on a reed litter. The dogs howl sadly while solemnly placing gifts for their deceased companion to enjoy in its afterlife. If the ceremony is not disturbed, the howling and gift-giving ends 1 minute later, after which the blink dogs fill in the hole with loose dirt, burying the dead dog. The mournful dogs then lope away.

The blink dogs don't take kindly to interruptions, but characters who approach respectfully can talk to them after the ceremony, assuming they are able to speak the dogs' language. The blink dogs reveal that their companion was slain while scouting out Loomlurch and the surrounding area. They urge any characters heading for the hag's lair to be cautious. The blink dogs can reveal the following information about the hag and her lair:

- Next to Loomlurch is a goblin market that sells all sorts of candy treats.
- The scarecrows planted in Granny Nightshade's garden scream loudly if they spot intruders.
- Granny Nightshade uses clockwork sparrows to communicate with her wicked sisters.

#### Buttered Campestri
The characters come across a campfire in the forest. A cauldron of water bubbles over the flames, and a frying pan that holds melted butter rests on a nearby rock. A lone **campestri** (see *appendix C*) sings merrily as it dips its cap into the butter. If questioned, the campestri says its friend, Kro'ah, asked it to rub melted butter into its flesh and has promised it a hot bath before dinner. Kro'ah is gathering firewood but should be back soon! Persuading the campestri to leave the campsite requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. After 1d4 + 2 minutes, Kro'ah the **goblin** (chaotic neutral) returns for his dinner. In addition to an armful of firewood, the goblin has an explorer's pack.

Although Kro'ah has no regard for the life of campestris and finds them quite delicious, he won't pick a fight with a group of well-armed adventurers. If the characters leave him alone, he gives them some useful information:

- There's a market at Loomlurch that sells all kinds of candy. (Kro'ah offers each character a stick of candy as proof.) The market is supervised by a goblin with a toffee apple head.
- Granny Nightshade puts children to work in her toy shop. The hag has a large key protruding from her back, almost like she's a big wind-up toy herself.

#### Centaur
An aged **centaur** named Winterbow approaches the characters and warns them that this realm is fading; they should return to their own world before Prismeer disappears entirely. Winterbow reveals that the other members of his clan galloped away to safety before the mists enveloped Prismeer, but he was too old to keep up with them. The centaur doesn't know the cause of the realm's impending destruction. If the characters seem kind, he tells them to seek out the unicorn at Wayward Pool for answers.

Winterbow's walking speed is 25 feet, and his vision is limited to a range of 60 feet. He knows the woods of Thither well enough to point characters in the direction of Loomlurch if that's where they aim to go.

#### Doomed Dryad
A hostile **dryad** and seven **awakened shrubs** emerge from the undergrowth and surround the characters. Any character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher spots the dryad and the shrubs before they arrive, and all other characters are surprised.

The dryad, Meadowleaf, was bound to an enchanted tree that Granny Nightshade felled and used to make wooden toys. Believing the characters to be mercenaries hired by Granny Nightshade to capture Will of the Feywild and the Getaway Gang, the dryad points an accusing finger toward them and orders the awakened shrubs, "Show these villains the true meaning of revenge!"

A character can use an action to make a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check in the hope of ending hostilities. On a successful check, the character convinces Meadowleaf (and, by extension, the shrubs) not to attack on their next turn, giving the characters a brief time in which to counter any false notions the dryad might have about the party's intentions and allegiances. If the characters make a sound argument in their defense, or if four or more shrubs are killed in the ensuing battle, Meadowleaf calls off the attack.

The dryad is too bitter and angry to apologize for any errors in judgment on her part. Reminding her of the rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*) is enough to convince her that she should be nicer to travelers passing through the forest, which is the closest thing she has to a home now that her beloved tree is gone.

Deprived of her tree, Meadowleaf is doomed to sink ever deeper into despair. If her encounter with the characters ends peacefully, she urges them to restore Zybilna to power so that other dryads won't suffer a similar fate. She also gives the characters three sycamore seeds. A creature that eats one of these seeds gains the benefit of a *pass without trace* spell, which lasts for 1 hour.

#### Grandfather Tree
The characters happen upon the following scene:

>>A gigantic, gnarled oak comes into view. Unlike other oaks in the forest, this tree looks unhealthy and has golden brown leaves. A thick carpet of dead leaves surrounds it, and three rusty sickles lie among the leaves. Standing next to each of these weapons is a bleating goat.
>>
>>Eight tiny houses made of woven twigs are nestled among the boughs of the tree. Squirrels dart nervously around these wee domiciles.
>>

The tree is dying due to the presence of the evil hag: it has simply given up the will to live. The tree is home to twenty-four **pixies**, all of which are invisible when the characters first arrive. The pixies share their twig houses with three families of squirrels. Less than an hour ago, three **redcaps** emerged from the woods and started throwing rocks at the pixie houses, trying to destroy them out of spite. The pixies retaliated by polymorphing the redcaps into **goats**. When the *polymorph* spells wear off in about 10 minutes, the pixies plan to polymorph the redcaps again unless they leave immediately. The pixies are unaccustomed to dealing with redcaps and don't know what else to do.

If the characters approach the tree and do not appear threatening, three pixies named Amaryllis, Calluna, and Zinnia become visible and warn the characters not to slay the goats, lest they transform back into redcaps. The pixies are nonviolent and would appreciate the characters' help. One thing the characters can do is gather up the redcaps' sickles (which they dropped when they started throwing rocks at the tree). The seizure of these weapons causes the goats to attack.

If they are deprived of their weapons and returned to their normal forms, the redcaps stomp their iron boots and demand that their sickles be returned to them. If the characters refuse to do so, the redcaps scream in fury and swear profusely before stomping away. Without their sickles, these redcaps are all bluster. If their weapons are returned to them, the redcaps attack the characters, hoping to soak their hats in the characters' blood. If the characters seem unable to deal with the redcaps on their own, the pixies use their magic to assist.

Once the redcaps are no longer a threat, the pixies share the following information with the characters:

- The redcaps started appearing when Granny Nightshade took over the forest. Like their creator, the redcaps appear to have no redeeming qualities.
- The hag grows the redcaps in a garden near her lair, which is inside a fallen tree that spans a ravine. (The pixies can't agree on the distance or direction to the hag's lair.)
- The grandfather oak upon which the pixies built their village is sickened by the hag's presence. Ridding Thither of Granny Nightshade might be the only way to return the tree to good health.

***Development.*** If the characters pass this way again after defeating the hag, they find the old tree's branches covered in fresh green buds—a sign that the grandfather oak is healing.

#### Jabberwock's Trail
The characters come across a trail of monstrous claw prints on the forest floor. Whatever creature left the trail was clearly enormous, as each print spans three feet from heel to toe. A character who examines the prints and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies them as belonging to some kind of dragon-like creature. After a few miles, the trail disappears abruptly. A character who examines the prints at the end of the trail can tell that they're unusually deep and can, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check, conclude that the creature launched itself into the air at this point, suggesting that it can fly.

#### Owlbear and Chariot
The characters encounter a domesticated **owlbear** yoked to a dilapidated elven chariot. It ran off into the woods after its rider, an elf, was snatched from the chariot by the jabberwock that frequents Zybilna's palace (see *chapter 5*). The owlbear's harness boss is engraved with a branch of the tree for which she is named: Juniper. The chariot is big enough to hold two Medium characters and their gear.

Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can calm Juniper and use her as a steed. The owlbear must be fed at least 8 pounds of meat every day to keep her docile. If she goes just one day without a proper meal, Juniper turns on her new owners and tries to eat them.

![[057-03-003.owlbear.png|right|300]]

#### Pixies
Three **pixies** sit around a tiny table, sipping tea and nibbling cakes. A 6-inch-long wedge made of wood lies on the ground nearby. The pixies found this piece of wood (a doorstop) on one of their recent forays into the Material Plane and are arguing about what it could be. Spiderlily thinks it's a slice of cake made for a treant, Cowslip thinks it's an exercise bench for mice, and Maypole is convinced it's a troll's toothpick.

The pixies entreat the characters to settle their dispute. They are profoundly disappointed to learn of the doorstop's mundane purpose and giggle with delight if they are treated to a convincing lie. Either way, they give a reed whistle to the character who impressed them the most. Once before the end of this adventure, that character can blow the whistle to summon the three pixies. This effect functions as a *conjure woodland beings* spell that summons only the three pixies and doesn't require concentration. The pixies fly away when the spell ends after 1 hour.

## Locations in Thither
The following encounters are tied to locations marked on the map of Thither. As the characters explore Thither, you can move these locations as needed, putting them in the characters' path. Ideally, you should run all three encounters in the following order before the characters arrive at Loomlurch or travel to Yon:

***Nib's Cave.*** The characters meet an old man who offers them gifts made from spun gold and who knows where the characters might find Will of the Feywild, a troublesome boy with a penchant for causing Granny Nightshade grief.

***Little Oak.*** Will of the Feywild leads the Getaway Gang from a treehouse nestled in the boughs of a friendly treant. Will knows the secret to the Hourglass Coven's undoing and suggests that the characters talk to Lamorna, a unicorn who lives by the Wayward Pool.

***Wayward Pool.*** Lamorna the unicorn has lost her mate, and she believes that the magic that traps Zybilna in the palace was accomplished using her mate's horn. Finding that unicorn horn might be the only way to free Zybilna and rid Prismeer of the Hourglass Coven.

### Nib's Cave
A miser toils inside a cave, spinning his gold into gifts for those who visit him. When the characters happen upon Nib's cave, read:

>>Cozy torchlight radiates from a cave in the wooded hillside. Twenty feet from the cave is a tree with a weathered sheet of parchment nailed to its trunk.
>>

The parchment nailed to the tree is one of Granny Nightshade's wanted posters (see "Wanted Posters" earlier in the chapter). Roll on the Wanted Posters table to determine which poster it is, and record this information on the *Story Tracker*.

Characters who announce their arrival hear an old man invite them inside the cave. If they enter, read:

>>Inside the cave, a wizened old man wearing a blindfold sits at a spinning wheel, surrounded by piles of gold. As he spins, he reaches down and grasps handfuls of coins, which transform at his touch into gleaming gold fibers.
>>

Nib is an unarmed human **commoner** (neutral) from a city called Waterdeep on a world called Toril. He is blinded, but only while wearing his blindfold. His cave contains a total of 27,213 gp, heaped in piles on the floor—what's left of Nib's acquired wealth. The gold radiates an aura of conjuration magic if inspected with a *detect magic* spell. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Nib.

If the characters inquire about Nib's predicament, he recounts his sorry tale:

>>"I've led a cruel and heartless existence. I earned these riches by exploiting my tenants' misery, buying up condemned property and renting it out for an exorbitant fee. Granny Nightshade is helping me to make amends. I told her I wanted to put my bad deeds behind me and my ill-gotten gains to good use. She cursed me to dwell forever in this cave, spinning my gold into useful items for anyone who comes my way."
>>

In accordance with the rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*), Nib offers to craft a gift for each character. Taking up a pair of knitting needles, he swiftly knits his gold yarn into an object that retains a golden luster or some amount of golden color in its design. Roll a d8 and refer to the Gold-spun Gifts table to determine each item. (All the items listed in the table are uncommon magic items.) If a character asks Nib to make something specific, Nib honors that request, provided the desired item is a nonmagical item worth no more than 1,000 gp, or a magic item of common or uncommon rarity. Nib can make only one gift for each character, and his spinning wheel can't work its magic under any other hand. Nib's supply of gold coins decreases by an amount equal to the value of the item he creates (minimum 1 gp). A common magic item reduces his supply by 100 gp, while an uncommon magic item reduces it by 500 gp.

A character might feel obliged to honor the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2) and offer Nib something in return for his gifts. Nib kindly accepts whatever the character offers but isn't looking for help to end his curse, because as long as Granny Nightshade remains in control of Thither, he sees no hope of escape.

##### Gold-spun Gifts
| d8 | Gift |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | *Amulet of proof against detection and location* |
| 2 | *Bag of holding* |
| 3 | *Boots of elvenkind* |
| 4 | *Bracers of archery* |
| 5 | *Cloak of protection* |
| 6 | *Gloves of thievery* |
| 7 | *Wand of secrets* |
| 8 | Tiny hourglass that functions like an *elemental gem* of the blue sapphire (air elemental) variety |

#### Nib's Haunts
As Nib works, characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher glimpse one or more apparitions lurking behind him. These apparitions take various forms, from a grubby child peering over Nib's shoulder to a gaunt coachman looming in the shadows at the back of the cave. Other possible apparitions include a long-faced woman dabbing at her tears with a handkerchief and a rail-thin waif wearing an eye patch. Quick as a candle's flicker, one apparition vanishes, and another appears. If the characters ask Nib about the apparitions, he explains the nature of his curse:

>>"I am haunted by my own words: as long as my ill-gotten gains were put to good use, my bad deeds would remain behind me. You are beholding the restless apparitions of those I hurt. They lurk behind my back, tormenting me with pokes at my ribs and whisperings in my ear. I can't bear to look them in the eye, not after what I did to them!"
>>

Nib wears his blindfold to avoid inadvertently glancing over his shoulder or catching glimpses of the apparitions reflected in his piles of gold.

Nib warns the characters not to take any of his gold, lest they be cursed like him. Any character who steals gold from Nib's cave is haunted by 1d4 apparitions similar to those that haunt Nib. As a consequence of these hauntings, the character gains 1 level of exhaustion after finishing a long rest. Levels of exhaustion gained from this effect cannot be removed until the character ends the haunting by returning the gold. A *wish* spell ends the hauntings and automatically returns the stolen gold to the cave. A *remove curse* or *greater restoration* spell cast on the culprit suppresses the effect for 24 hours.

Nib has been to Loomlurch, and has visited the goblin candy market (area L2), Granny Nightshade's parlor (area L3), and the workshop (area L4). If the characters ask Nib for more information about Granny Nightshade and Loomlurch, he imparts the following details:

- Granny Nightshade has a key protruding from her back that indicates her mood by how fast it turns. When she's happy, the key turns quickly. When she's upset, the key turns slowly. If she loses her temper, the key stops completely.
- Many children toil away in Granny Nightshade's workshop, crafting toys. Granny Nightshade delivers the creepiest toys to children on other worlds—to fill their heads with nightmares, one assumes. The hag makes her deliveries on the back of a flying rocking horse.
- Granny Nightshade is obsessed with capturing Will of the Feywild, a boy who helped a handful of younger children escape from Loomlurch. Will of the Feywild's motley group of rascals is known as the Getaway Gang. The gang is protected by a treant named Little Oak. (Nib's curse prevents him from leaving his cave, but he can point characters in the direction of Little Oak's favorite glade.)

### Little Oak
This encounter features a raggedy group of children called the Getaway Gang. Nib can provide directions to the treant that looks after the kids, or the characters can stumble across the treant's glade in their travels.

>>Up ahead, a small group of children frolics around a leafy oak tree, their gleeful yelps carrying through the forest. Painted swings dangle from the tree's branches. Nestled in its crown is a ramshackle treehouse.
>>

The tree is a **treant** named Little Oak. If they see strangers, the children scamper up ladders and take cover in their treehouse. Their leader, Will of the Feywild, barks at the adventurers, "Stand down or face merry hell!" Little Oak provides a home for this gang of rascals, all of whom escaped captivity in Loomlurch with Will's help.

Adventurers who threaten the children incur the wrath of Little Oak, which uproots itself and thunders to their defense. If the treant or one of its animated trees reduces a character to 0 hit points with a melee attack, it knocks the character unconscious instead of dealing a mortal wound. Unconscious characters are either tied up and questioned by Will or dragged to another part of the forest away from Little Oak.

If Little Oak is reduced to 0 hit points, the treant topples, destroying the Getaway Gang's treehouse and dealing 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage to each creature inside it.

#### Will of the Feywild
Will of the Feywild is not the spindly, 11-year-old boy he appears to be. He's an **oni** that has taken human form. His true name is Mugan, and he used to work for **Skabatha Nightshade** as a kidnapper of children until the hag's sisters placed a curse on him that warmed his heart, changing his alignment from lawful evil to chaotic good. He now strives to help children escape from Skabatha's clutches. Skabatha assumes that Mugan simply left her employment; she is unaware of the curse her sisters placed on the oni and doesn't know that Will of the Feywild is not a human boy. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Will of the Feywild.

If the oni is affected by a spell that ends a curse, it regains its evil alignment and attacks whoever is responsible for lifting the curse, shouting, "How could you?" as it fights to the death.

The oni has a pet **displacer beast kitten** (see the accompanying stat block) named Star, which it abandons if its curse is ended. Characters who aided Dirlagraun in the Witchlight Carnival (see chapter 1) might guess that Star is the older displacer beast's offspring. If they show Star the mirrored ball, it leaps about excitedly. If he is told about Dirlagraun, Will of the Feywild reluctantly agrees to return Star to his parent, but only if the characters help him free the remaining children that are trapped in Loomlurch.

![[058-637677438126059474.png|right|300]]

#### The Getaway Gang
The Getaway Gang has four members:

- Will of the Feywild, the gang's leader (described above)
- Bobi, a boisterous male dwarf growing his first whiskers
- Sloane, a sarcastic, ginger-haired female wood elf
- Zennor, a tenacious female orc

Bobi, Sloane, and Zennor are noncombatants (treat them as unarmed, chaotic good **commoners**) who appear to be eight years old, but they are several years older and wiser than they look. The magic of the Feywild has kept them young.

Speaking to the Getaway Gang about Loomlurch yields the following information:

- A squad of tin soldiers defends Loomlurch, but they're easily lured away by distractions.
- The children being held captive in the workshop are haunted by boggles—oily creatures that sprout from the children's misery.
- Granny Nightshade imprisons her most hated enemies in a cell inside her kitchen.

***Secret of Wayward Pool.*** Bobi, Sloane, and Zennor agree that the characters should pay a visit to Wayward Pool and seek out the unicorn Lamorna before heading to Loomlurch. Will is skeptical, because he thinks the unicorn is a "no-good goody-goody" who is too scared to challenge Granny Nightshade.

The Getaway Gang shares the following information about Wayward Pool if the characters express interest in going there:

- Only unicorns can reach the shore of Wayward Pool, but the magic protecting the pool can't tell the difference between a real unicorn and a make-believe one. To reach the lake themselves, the kids created a crude unicorn costume under which they can hide. (They keep the costume in their treehouse and can lend it to the characters, although it's big enough to hold only two adults.)
- Tying a wooden horn to one's head also bypasses the pool's magical ward.
- On a small island in the middle of the lake, the characters can find an iron bowl filled with fresh coals. Summoning the unicorn can be accomplished by lighting a fire in that bowl.

***Guide to Yon.*** If the characters are searching for a guide to Yon, Will asks one of the other children to fetch Squirt, who is currently tucked away in Little Oak's treehouse.

#### Little Oak's Treehouse
The Getaway Gang's treehouse is big enough to accommodate up to twelve children comfortably. Rope ladders climb from the ground to a pair of trapdoors in the floor. When the characters can see inside the treehouse, read:

>>The floor of the treehouse is covered with blankets, cushions, and piles of straw. Hanging from the six-foot-high ceiling by a rope is a basket that holds apples, berries, sugarcane, and a few crumpled-up sheets of parchment. In one corner, lying on a cushion, is a rusty oilcan that looks out of place. Heaped in another corner is a crude unicorn costume made of polka-dot quilts and a wooden horse's head that has a wooden horn attached to it.
>>

The crumpled-up sheets of parchment in the basket are three of Granny Nightshade's wanted posters (see "Wanted Posters" earlier in the chapter). Roll on the Wanted Posters table to determine each poster, allowing for duplicates.

***Oilcan.*** The oilcan is an animated Construct named **Squirt** (see the accompanying stat block). Squirt's excesses and self-indulgences have left it feeling literally empty inside, and it doesn't have enough oil right now to use its Boggle Oil action. If the characters fill Squirt with more boggle oil, it offers to guide them from Thither to Yon. Squirt knows that Granny Nightshade's workshop employs boggles and can lead the group there. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Squirt.

***Unicorn Costume.*** The Getaway Gang fashioned the unicorn costume so that they could reach the water at Wayward Pool and bathe in it. This costume is big enough to be worn by two adults or four children walking in single file. The wooden horse's head is mounted on a stick that the person in the lead holds up, and the children have glued a wooden horn to the horse's brow. Small holes in the fabric allow the costume's wearers to see where they're going under the covering.

***Unicorn Horn.*** If the *Story Tracker* indicates that the unicorn horn is here, it replaces the wooden horn on the kids' unicorn costume. The children don't know that the horn is from a real unicorn.

![[059-637677445481636392.png|right|300]]

#### Development
Will of the Feywild has conceived a daring plan to free the children still being held prisoner in Loomlurch, which he shares with the characters if they decide to aid him. Using a stick, Will sketches a rough map of the lair in the dirt and outlines the plan as follows:

- **The Approach** Bobi, Sloane, Zennor, and Star will creep through the woods to the west of the tree and hide just out of sight of the screaming scarecrows (area L5). Meanwhile, Will will sneak around to the entrance to the kitchen (area L13) on the east side of the tree.
- **The Distraction** The characters will enter the goblin market (area L2) posing as travelers, purchase some sweets, and arrange for a meeting with the hag. During the meeting, the children will alert the screaming scarecrows and thereby lure the tin soldiers into the garden.
- **The Escape** While everyone is distracted, the characters will free the captives from the workshop (area L4) while Will climbs into the textile mill (area L12) to free the captives there. Once the children are set free, everyone will run back to Little Oak.

Will's plan is sketchy, but he likes to live by the seat of his pants. Regardless of how events unfold, he never reveals his true form, fearing it would terrify the children he's trying to rescue or frighten away the other members of the Getaway Gang. Consequently, he refrains from using his oni abilities in the presence of the children or the characters.

### Wayward Pool
Characters on their way to Loomlurch or Little Oak are likely to pass by Wayward Pool. When the characters first catch sight of this small lake, read:

>>Mist drifts over the surface of a small lake. Forested crags line the shore on one side of the lake, and mossy rocks protrude from the shallows. Near the center of the lake is a rocky islet.
>>

Those who try to come within 1,000 feet of the pool's shoreline find that any path they take through the forest leads them back to where they started, and flying creatures find themselves unintentionally veering off course. This glamor is the work of a unicorn named Lamorna, who has claimed Wayward Pool as her domain. To reach the shore, one must be a unicorn or adopt the guise of one. The Getaway Gang has a unicorn costume that can accommodate two characters; other characters can satisfy the pool's protective ward by attaching fake unicorn horns to their heads. False horns can easily be hewn from wood or created using a *silent image* spell or similar magic.

![[060-03-004.lamorna.png|right|300]]

The wizard **Kelek**, founder of the League of Malevolence (see appendix B), has ordered the assassin **Zarak** to hunt down Lamorna and chop off her horn. **Zarak** lurks in the forested outskirts of the pool, trying to find a way to the shore. (He doesn't know about the "look like a unicorn" requirement.) Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 higher get the feeling they are being watched. See "Zarak Attacks!" below for more information.

#### Regional Effects
As long as Lamorna is alive, the following regional effects apply within 1,000 feet of the lake:

- All nonmagical flames in the region are extinguished. (A fire that's ignited in the bowl of coals on the lake's central island is an exception to this rule.)
- Beasts and Fey have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in the region.
- Any creature that bathes in the lake for at least 1 minute can choose to end 1 level of exhaustion affecting it or one curse affecting it. Alternatively, the creature can end its attunement to one cursed magic item.

#### Summoning the Unicorn
Getting to the islet in the middle of the lake requires crossing 250 feet of fresh, still water. The lake is 30 feet deep, and the islet is 30 feet wide and 40 feet long.

Perched atop the islet's highest point, 30 feet above the surface of the water, is an iron bowl filled with coals. If a creature lights a fire in the bowl using the coals, Lamorna the **unicorn** appears on the lakeshore 1 minute later and waits for the characters there; otherwise, she remains hidden.

If Lamorna appears, read:

>>The lakeshore mists part to reveal a white horse with a single gleaming horn on her brow. She stands perfectly still, silently observing you.
>>

Lamorna bolts into the forest if the adventurers make any threatening moves. Otherwise, she waits for one or more characters to approach within 60 feet of her, and then makes contact telepathically. Lamorna is curious to know why the group has come to Thither and is sympathetic toward anyone who has a grievance with the Hourglass Coven.

Lamorna can reveal the following information. As she speaks, the waters of the lake animate to form liquid sculptures of the things she describes:

- The domain of Prismeer once belonged to the archfey Zybilna, but was usurped by her cruel hag stepsisters: **Skabatha Nightshade**, **Bavlorna Blightstraw**, and **Endelyn Moongrave**.
- Zybilna was vainglorious and deceitful at times, but her magic kept Prismeer safe and isolated. That situation ended when the hags of the Hourglass Coven captured Lamorna's mate, Elidon; stole his horn; and used its magic to imprison Zybilna in her stronghold, the Palace of Heart's Desire.
- Elidon's horn might be needed to free Zybilna, but Lamorna doesn't know the whereabouts of Elidon or his horn. She tells the characters that she believes Elidon is the hags' prisoner. (If Elidon had died, Lamorna believes she would've sensed it.)

Lamorna exhorts the characters to free Zybilna and save Prismeer from the evil hags. She tells them that one of Yon's denizens, **Amidor the dandelion**, can lead the group safely to the Palace of Heart's Desire. She offers Wayward Pool as a safe place to rest, if the characters need it. She can also describe the lake's magical properties (see "Regional Effects" above).

If the characters question Lamorna about the Palace of Heart's Desire, she reveals the following information:

- When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, no one could enter her palace without an invitation. It's unlikely that the Hourglass Coven is capable of enforcing similar restrictions on the palace.
- A library on the second floor of the palace contains Zybilna's most treasured tomes.
- A dragon-like creature called a jabberwock lives in Zybilna's palace and frequently prowls the forest. The jabberwock tries to reach Wayward Pool but is always turned away by the lake's protective magic. Lamorna emphasizes that the characters would be wise to avoid the jabberwock, for once it sets its fiery eyes on prey, it rarely gives up the hunt.

#### Zarak Attacks!
**Zarak** (see appendix B) follows the characters to the lakeshore, avoiding detection all the while. After seeing the characters adopt one or more unicorn disguises to reach the shore, he crafts a wooden fake unicorn horn, which he ties to his head with a leather belt strap and removes upon arriving at the lakeshore. He makes his assault as the characters' conversation with Lamorna winds down, taking advantage of the distraction provided by the characters to surprise the unicorn:

>>A cloaked figure springs from the forest and, with blades flashing, attacks the unicorn. Under the assassin's cowl, you see a wide, toothy smile.
>>

Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher are not surprised by **Zarak**. All other creatures in the area, including Lamorna, are surprised.

On Lamorna's first turn after the surprise round, she teleports away, denying **Zarak** his prize and leaving him to face the characters alone. At this point, **Zarak** is disgusted with himself for not felling the unicorn immediately ("I didn't know unicorns could do that," he mutters as Lamorna teleports away), but he's smart enough not to antagonize the characters any more than he already has. If the characters aren't spoiling for a fight, **Zarak** is satisfied to stand down and retreat back into the forest.

**Zarak** is willing to give up his hunt in exchange for gold or if the characters seem likely to kill him. Characters who tell **Zarak** about the riches in Nib's cave (see "Nib's Cave" earlier in the chapter) pique his greed; if he is led there, he takes all the gold he can carry and falls prey to Nib's curse.

The characters can try to capture **Zarak**, but he'd rather die than surrender his weapons and his freedom. He's not much use as a hostage, since no other member of the League of Malevolence cares what happens to him, and he refuses to divulge the secret ways to and from the Palace of Heart's Desire. But if a *charm person* spell or similar magic is used to make him friendly toward one or more of the characters, he can be coaxed into sharing the following information with them:

- Most of the creatures in Zybilna's palace, including Zybilna, are frozen in time. The hags of the Hourglass Coven used an artifact called *Iggwilv's Cauldron* to accomplish this effect. **Zarak** doesn't know exactly how the cauldron or its magic works.
- The self-proclaimed leader of the League of Malevolence is a human sorcerer named **Kelek**. He wants to take custody of a magic staff belonging to his hated rival, the wizard **Ringlerun**, who is among those frozen in Zybilna's palace. Apparently, a unicorn's horn is needed to free **Ringlerun** from temporal stasis, which would then enable **Kelek** to seize **Ringlerun**'s staff.
- **Zargash**, a human priest of Orcus, is another member of the League of Malevolence. Although he hopes to challenge **Kelek**'s leadership one day, **Zargash** won't do anything about it as long as **Kelek** is protected by **Warduke**, a mercenary who has a *flame tongue longsword*.
- A fifth member of the League of Malevolence, a human warlock named **Skylla**, gets her magic from an archfey named Baba Yaga. **Skylla** knows more about *Iggwilv's Cauldron* and the hags of the Hourglass Coven than anyone else (as far as **Zarak** knows). But she has gone missing, and none of the other members of the league know where to find her.

#### Development
Lamorna's mate, Elidon, has been transformed into a flying rocking horse that Granny Nightshade rides as a mount. If the spell on Elidon is broken and he is reunited with Lamorna, she rewards each character with a *charm of heroism* (see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

## Loomlurch
Granny Nightshade's lair is built around a twisted workshop carved out of the interior of a gigantic oak that has fallen over.

The workshop is operated by kidnapped children who are allowed a small measure of freedom to carry out their labors, under the watchful eyes of the hag's minions.

Loomlurch has the following physical features:

- **Ceilings** Unless otherwise noted, ceilings throughout Loomlurch are 8 feet high.
- **Doors** Loomlurch's doors are made of sturdy wood with iron handles and fittings. All doors are unlocked unless the text says otherwise. As an action, a character using thieves' tools can make a successful DC 14 Dexterity check to pick the lock on a locked door, or a character can try to force a door open, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
- **Floors, Walls, and Stairs** Floors, walls, and staircases are hewn out of the wood of the giant tree.
- **Windows** Loomlurch's windows are openable but are latched shut from the inside.

## Approaching Loomlurch
Describe Loomlurch to the players as their characters come within view of the site:

>>The forest is at its darkest here. Up ahead, a colossal dead oak lies on its side. Three living trees grow naturally out of its fallen remains. Their shapes resemble towers, with candlelit windows twinkling in the gloom and wooden balconies encircling gnarled branches. On one side of the fallen tree, firelight spills from a pair of quaint storefront windows, illuminating a clearing filled with merchant stalls.
>>

Characters arrive near the root bridges (area L1). Anyone who observes the workshop (area L4) can see diminutive figures prowling around inside: kidnapped children and boggles.

> ##### Double, Double, Toil and Trouble
>If the characters drive **Bavlorna Blightstraw** from her home in *chapter 2*, the hag takes refuge with her sister, **Skabatha Nightshade**, and spends all her time in the study (area L14), poring through Skabatha's ritual books for a clever spell to overcome the characters or feeling sorry for herself. The two hags avoid each other as much as possible. Whenever they squabble, which is often, Skabatha ridicules her sister for Bavlorna's failure at the hands of the characters.
>

Before the party enters Loomlurch, Will of the Feywild—if he is present—outlines his plan for rescuing Granny Nightshade's child captives (see "Getaway Gang Raid"). Characters who have not earned Will's assistance must devise their own plan for getting inside.

## Where's Skabatha?
All of Loomlurch's denizens are aware of Granny Nightshade's daily routine, which is as follows:

- After waking from a long rest, she putters about in her garden (area L5) for 1d3 hours.
- Most of her day is spent in the kitchen (area L13), with occasional visits to the study (area L14).
- Before going to bed, the hag spends 1 hour conducting an inspection of the sewing room (area L9), the textile mill (area L12), and the workshop (area L4). After the inspection, Granny Nightshade moves to her bedroom (area L16), miniaturizes herself, and takes a long rest inside the dollhouse there.

Visitors can arrange a meeting with Skabatha by speaking to Chucklehead the goblin boss (in area L2) or Pincushion the living doll (in area L9). Any such meeting with the hag takes place in the parlor (area L3).

See appendix B for a description of **Skabatha Nightshade** and a summary of her rivalries with her sisters.

### Bargaining with Skabatha
If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook and the *Story Tracker* indicates that Skabatha has one or more things in her possession that the characters desire, Skabatha claims undisputable ownership of these lost things, asserting that she acquired them "fair and square." Even so, she is willing to negotiate with characters who want to procure them. She is also inclined to strike bargains with characters who have other needs.

In exchange for one thing in her possession that a character has lost, Skabatha demands the characters complete one of the following quests:

- **Capture Will** Capture the brigand Will of the Feywild and bring him to Granny Nightshade alive. He's sure to be hiding somewhere in the forest.
- **Find the Lost Horn** Bring her the unicorn horn that she says her sister Bavlorna recently lost. Maybe Prismeer's native denizens can help the characters find it.
- **Spoil a Play** Sabotage a theatrical performance in *Motherhorn*, **Endelyn Moongrave**'s castle in Yon (see *chapter 4*). Skabatha would like nothing more than to see her sister bought down a peg or two. (To get to Yon, the characters will need a guide. Granny Nightshade expects them to know this fact and offers no help in finding a guide or seeing them safely to Yon.)

Skabatha is true to her word, returning one lost thing for each task completed while offering no assistance toward accomplishing the tasks. Skabatha used the lost things to fashion minor magic items, all of which she keeps in her dollhouse (area L16).

### Skabatha's Clockwork Key
The clockwork key embedded in Skabatha's back rotates quickly when she's in a good mood and slows down as her mood sours. When she is furious, the key comes to a dead stop. When the key stops turning, Skabatha attacks objects or creatures indiscriminately until something lifts her spirits and quells her rage, such as the defeat of an enemy or some other triumph, whereupon her key starts turning again. Whenever Skabatha loses her temper and turns violent, 1d3 redcaps sprout in her garden (see area L15 and "Skabatha's Minions" below).

The key can't be removed from Skabatha's back while she lives, and it serves no function in the adventure other than to reflect her current mood.

### Defeating Skabatha
In dire circumstances, Skabatha flees Loomlurch on her flying rocking horse mount (see area L6) and retreats to Motherhorn, the lair of her youngest sister, Endelyn (see *chapter 4*). If **Bavlorna Blightstraw** is in Loomlurch, she flees to Motherhorn as well.

If Skabatha is slain, a beetle emerges from her rotten flesh and whispers **Endelyn Moongrave**'s weakness to Skabatha's killer: "Endelyn fears eclipses, not just real ones but symbolic ones as well. If you want to kill her, best do it during an eclipse, or her body will re-form."

### Skabatha's Ring of Keys
If the characters defeat Skabatha or successfully pick her pocket, they can obtain a ring of three iron keys that she keeps on her person:

- The first key locks and unlocks the doors leading from the garden (area L5) to the workshop (area L4) and the sewing room (area L9), and the door between areas L6 and L11.
- The second key locks and unlocks the doors to the kitchen (area L13) and Mishka's chains there.
- The third key locks and unlocks the door to the cell in the kitchen (area L13).

## Skabatha's Minions
Granny Nightshade entrusts Loomlurch's defense to various creatures, as described below. The hag's minions, except for the redcaps, have orders to capture intruders alive and bring them before her.

### Boggles
The despair of Loomlurch's children has given rise to six **boggles** (see *appendix C*), three in area L4 and three in area L12. These cowardly creatures aren't loyal to the hag, yet she tolerates them for the distress they cause the children.

### Cradlefall
![[061-03-005.cradlefalls-dragon-in-the-box.png|right|300]]

This **green dragon wyrmling** likes to hide in painted wooden boxes, of which there are three: one each in areas L3, L6, and L7. Each box is 3 feet on a side and has a hinged lid. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around a box. A crank protruding from one side of the box attaches to a tiny metal music box mounted to the wooden box's inside wall. Winding the crank causes the music box to play a 10-second tune reminiscent of a child's lullaby. As the final note sounds, roll a d8. If the roll is 3 or lower and Cradlefall has not yet been defeated, the wyrmling bursts out like a jack-in-the-box, attacking creatures he considers his enemies. If the wyrmling has been dealt with, the lid springs open, but the box is empty.

While curled up in a box with the lid closed, Cradlefall can use an action to teleport himself and anything he is holding to another closed box in Loomlurch. When he is not hiding in a box, Cradlefall curls up in front of the oven in Granny Nightshade's kitchen (area L13). *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Cradlefall.

### Redcaps
Whenever Skabatha's windup key runs down, her anger boils over, causing 1d3 murderous **redcaps** (see *appendix C*) to sprout in area L15. These redcaps are too hateful to serve as guards, so Skabatha sends them scuttling off into Thither to wreak havoc. Until she does so, the redcaps remain in area L15 and attack other creatures on sight.

### Tin Soldiers
These **ten automatons** are fashioned to look like stout infantry soldiers, and they obey Skabatha without question. Six of them remain in the barracks (area L7), and the remaining four patrol the balconies outside areas L8 and L12. They charge forth to investigate any suspicious activity they see or hear, meaning that they are easily distracted. Each one is a Small (3-foot-tall) suit of **animated armor** with 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points.

## Lost Children
Over the years, Skabatha's minions have lured children from the Witchlight Carnival to Thither, allowing the hag to trap them in her workshop. Locked in an eternal battle with hardship, these unfortunates never grow old and have no hope of escape. The hag keeps the children safe and healthy, since to do otherwise would cause them to vanish (see "Children of Prismeer" in *chapter 2*). The hag's minions likewise have strict orders not to physically harm the children.

##### Lost Children
| Child | Location | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| Naal (11-year-old male drow) | L4 | Stole the key to the kitchen door |
| Sung (9-year-old female human) | L4 | — |
| Philomena (8-year-old female lightfoot halfling) | L4 | Won't leave Loomlurch without Oink the pig |
| Brottor (10-year-old male hill dwarf) | L8 | Gravely ill after eating nightshade |
| Pud (12-year-old male human) | L8 | Secretly loyal to Granny Nightshade |
| Wendel (11-year-old male strongheart halfling) | L9 | — |
| Roff (10-year-old female bugbear) | L9 | Stole a pouch of *dust of corrosion* |
| Yevelda (8-year-old female goblin) | L12 | Knows a secret route into Granny Nightshade's bedroom |
| Callybon (11-year-old female forest gnome) | L12 | — |
| Pogo (9-year-old male forest gnome) | L12 | — |
| Mishka (9-year-old female human) | L13 | Chained to a worktable |

The Lost Children table identifies the children currently held captive inside Loomlurch and their locations when the characters arrive. As time passes, the children can move about the lair, at your discretion. They stay clear of danger and play no role in combat. All of them are chaotic good.

Children free of Granny Nightshade's tyranny have no easy way to return home, but they can take refuge at Little Oak's treehouse or be left in the care of the unicorn Lamorna at Wayward Pool. The dwarf **Elkhorn** (see area L13) insists on remaining in Thither to care for the children if no one else will. If Zybilna is freed from her stasis, she returns the children to their proper homes.

## Loomlurch Locations
The following descriptions are keyed to the map of Loomlurch.

![[063-map-3.2-loomlurch-player.jpg|right|300]]
### L1. Root Bridges
These two bridges have the same features. When the characters first approach one of them, read:

>>A gnarled bridge formed by tangled tree roots spans a rocky, dried-up riverbed.
>>

The bridges sway and creak when crossed. To avoid making a racket, each creature traveling along a bridge must make a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed check, the creatures stationed in the goblin market (area L2) are alerted; they take no action immediately but can't be surprised.

### L2. Goblin Market
The characters can enter this area from the eastern root bridge or by traversing the adjoining woodland.

>>Three stalls selling candy are situated in this clearing, lit by windows carved into the giant fallen tree to one side of it. Two goblins are working in each stall, and the whole enterprise is watched closely by a goblin with a toffee apple head who appears to be muttering quietly to himself.
>>

![[064-03-006.chucklehead.png|right|300]]

This market sells goblin-made candies of all sorts. Six **goblins** (lawful neutral) work here, two per stall, under the watchful gaze of their **goblin boss**, Chucklehead (neutral), whose head has been reshaped by fey magic to look like a toffee apple. The stallholders greet patrons warmly and invite them to sample and buy their delicious wares. Meanwhile, Chucklehead watches out for thieves.

***Chucklehead.*** The goblin boss can escort characters to the parlor (area L3) if they request a meeting with Granny Nightshade. When left alone, he mutters to himself as though he's having a constant but mild crisis of conscience. If the characters ask Chucklehead whom he's muttering to, he says that a maggot crawled into his head and is slowly eating it from the inside out. He's not sad about this turn of events because it has changed his outlook and disposition, making him kinder and more sympathetic to the plight of others. He claims he can speak to the maggot and it speaks to him, even though it actually doesn't. The maggot in the goblin's head will kill him in 30 days unless he receives the benefit of magic that cures a disease. That magic slays the maggot but also reverts Chucklehead's alignment to neutral evil.

Chucklehead is protective of Mishka (see area L13) and wants to help her get away from Loomlurch, but he's too scared of Granny Nightshade to free Mishka from the hag's clutches. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Chucklehead.

***Merchant Stalls.*** The goods sold here are delicious but made with disgusting ingredients. Examples include beetles encased in hard candy, lollipops made from compacted ants, and jellied worms. The stallholders charge one trinket per treat. Roll a d8 and consult the Candy Treats table to determine what magical effect befalls a creature that eats one of these treats. Each effect lasts for 1 hour.

If a creature eats multiple treats and gets the same effect twice, extend the duration of the effect by 1 hour. A creature can have up to three different magical effects on it at any given time. If a creature eats a candy treat while it is already affected by three others, don't roll on the table. Instead, the creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw; on a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 8 hours.

##### Candy Treats
| d8 | Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Your footfalls emit musical notes that can be heard out to a range of 30 feet. |
| 2 | Eating the candy causes you to foam at the mouth, making it difficult (but not impossible) for you to speak. |
| 3 | Your fingers leave indelible stains on anything you touch. |
| 4 | Your head swells to twice its normal size. |
| 5 | You shrink, as though affected by the reduce effect of an *enlarge/reduce* spell. |
| 6 | Fireflies are drawn to you and form a persistent cloud around you, shedding bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. |
| 7 | You grow, as though affected by the enlarge effect of an *enlarge/reduce* spell. |
| 8 | You are targeted by a *polymorph* spell and automatically fail the saving throw against it. The new form is a butterfly (use the **bat** stat block, but omit its darkvision, Echolocation trait, and Bite attack). |

### L3. Parlor
The door to area L4 is closed but not locked.

>>This chamber is nestled between walls of twisted roots, through gaps in which you can see the eerily beautiful woodland surrounding you. A closed wooden door stands opposite the root bridge that leads into this room, in the center of which are four armchairs encircling a small table laid out for a tea service. A painted wooden box three feet on a side rests in a corner. A crank protrudes from one side of it, causing it to resemble an oversized jack-in-the-box.
>>

If **Bavlorna Blightstraw** retreated to Loomlurch after fleeing her home in *chapter 2*, her *bobbing lily pad* (see *appendix A*) lies on the floor next to the box, vaguely resembling a leaf-shaped carpet. Bavlorna herself can be found in area L14.

Three of the armchairs are trained **mimics** in disguise. They are magically compelled to remain in this room and adhere to creatures only when Granny Nightshade orders them to do so. The mimics are trained in nonlethal combat; characters reduced to 0 hit points by the mimics are stable rather than dying, giving the hag a chance to decide what to do with the unconscious victims.

***Dragon-in-the-Box.*** The wooden box with the crank is one of the boxes where **Cradlefall** might be found (see "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter).

***Tea with Granny Nightshade.*** Characters who arrange a meeting with Granny Nightshade through Chucklehead (area L2) or Pincushion (area L9) are left here for a while before the hag shows up. When Granny Nightshade arrives, read:

>>The door creaks open, and a little old woman totters forward. She wears a grimy, old-fashioned shawl, and her skin looks like gnarled bark. A large iron key extends from her back, ticking rhythmically as it rotates.
>>
>>"Sit down, children," she says in a voice reminiscent of crunching leaves. "Let's have some tea."
>>

**Skabatha Nightshade** (see appendix B) obeys the rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" in chapter 2) and presents herself as a kind host who is keen to know why the characters have paid her a visit. See "Bargaining with Skabatha" for guidance on running this conversation, during which she pours tea into filthy cups and stirs the liquid with a chicken bone, insisting that the characters drink up. On occasion, she reaches around with one of her arms and winds up her key. If the characters belittle or threaten her, Granny Nightshade orders her mimics to adhere to her guests and beat them unconscious while she watches with amusement.

***Treasure.*** Characters who scour the parlor for treasure find the following items:

- A *spell scroll* of *speak with plants* tucked in a side table drawer
- A set of four silver teaspoons engraved with pained facial expressions (5 gp per spoon)
- A bronze candlestick shaped like a bird's leg (10 gp)

### L4. Workshop
The doors to areas L3 and L7 are closed but not locked. The door to area L5 is locked, and Granny Nightshade has the only key (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter).

>>Flickering lanterns illuminate a cluttered workshop filled with soft, ambient music produced by bells and chimes. Parts of toys are heaped on the tables—leering doll's heads, half-built rocking horses, unpainted wooden balls, and the stuffed limbs of soft toys. A stove at the back of the room holds a saucepan of smelting metal. Three doors exit the workshop, and two storefront windows overlook the market outside.
>>

The ambient music is a permanent magical effect that can't be heard outside the workshop. If the characters enter quietly, add:

>>Three young children are gathered around a wooden worktable. The eldest, a drow boy, prances on the tabletop with a bar of soap in one hand, while a halfling girl and a human girl giggle at his audacity.
>>

Granny Nightshade makes captured children craft nightmarish toys in this workshop. Three children are present when the characters arrive: Naal (an 11-year-old male drow), Sung (a 9-year-old female human), and Philomena (an 8-year-old female lightfoot halfling). They've been the hag's prisoners for longer than any of them can remember and are wary of grown-ups. If the characters barge into the room, Philomena panics and runs to get help from the **tin soldiers** in area L7. All three children want to escape the hag's clutches, although Philomena weeps if she's forced to leave without her beloved piglet, Oink, who is kept in the pigpen (area L5).

Naal recently stole the kitchen key from Pincushion (see area L9) and took an impression of it using a bar of soap before fastening the key back onto Pincushion's belt. When the characters arrive, Naal is recounting his heroic tale to the two girls. He wants to create a copy of the key and then sneak into the kitchen to steal milk. Naal gives characters the bar of soap if they give him something in return, such as fresh milk or some other tasty treat. ("It's the rule of recip—... recip—... give-and-get," he says.)

***Boggles.*** Three **boggles** (see *appendix C*) lurk in the shadows, intending to play pranks on the visitors. Characters who spend a minute or so inside the workshop notice unsettling changes; dolls' heads turn to face them when they're not looking, balls bounce suddenly out of dark corners, or molten tin from the smelting pot splashes on the floor nearby. A character can use an action to try to detect hidden creatures, spotting all three boggles with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. If they are spotted, the boggles flee to the box in area L7 and turn its crank, hoping Cradlefall will pop out of the box and defend them. The boggles avoid combat themselves.

If Squirt is with the party, it encourages the characters to acquire as much boggle oil as they can. Only slippery boggle oil will do (see the "Boggle Oil" sidebar). Captured boggles provide the oil freely, hoping to earn their freedom.

***Treasure.*** Characters who ransack the workshop uncover the following valuables:

- A jar of iridescent glass eyes (10 gp)
- A silver hammer and chisel in a green leather tool belt (15 gp for the set)
- Iron metalworking tongs shaped like the jaws of a snapping dragon (15 gp)

> ##### Boggle Oil
>A **boggle** excretes oil from its pores and can make the oil slippery or sticky. **Squirt the oilcan** needs slippery boggle oil to use its Boggle Oil action, and it can hold up to three applications of the oil. Boggle oil normally evaporates after 1 hour, but the oil is preserved indefinitely inside Squirt.
>
>When a boggle creates a puddle of slippery oil on the ground, a character can scoop up 1d3 applications of the oil from the puddle (a process that takes 1 minute) before the oil disappears.
>
>A friendly boggle will create three applications of boggle oil in exchange for a gift of equal perceived value, such as a trinket. An indifferent boggle expects a better gift for the same amount of oil, such as a bag of candy, a gemstone, or a magnifying glass. An unfriendly or hostile boggle won't cooperate unless it is captured and forced to create oil to avoid punishment.
>

***Window Displays.*** The following creepy toys are displayed in the workshop windows:

- A set of nesting dolls in which each doll looks more frightened than the next larger one
- A stuffed lion with needles for teeth and real bloodstains around its jaws
- A toy windmill with a crank on one side that turns the vanes and the millstone
- A set of playing cards depicting weeping children
- A wind-up drunkard doll that totters a few paces and then falls over
- Four finger puppets depicting an arguing family
- A 1-foot-tall wooden guillotine
- A tiny wooden box containing eight sticks of black chalk

### L5. Granny Nightshade's Garden
This outdoor garden extends almost the entire length of Loomlurch. The doors to areas L4 and L9 are locked, and Granny Nightshade has the only key that unlocks them (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter). Three balconies overlooking the garden connect to areas L8, L9, and L12, respectively. The balcony outside area L9 is only 5 feet above the ground; the others are 20 feet high.

>>A woodland basin filled with plants and fungi stretches out along one side of the fallen tree. A pumpkin patch is at one end of the garden, next to a steaming compost heap, with ramshackle pens for pigs and goats at the opposite end. Bedraggled scarecrows hang from tall wooden stakes in the basin's wooded slope. Two ground-level doors and three balconies provide entry to the hag's lair.
>>

**Skabatha Nightshade** (see appendix B) uses the garden to cultivate ingredients for her potions and candies. The hag spends a few hours here each day tending to her plants (see Where's Skabatha? earlier in the chapter). Characters who won the game of hide-and-seek in the Witchlight Carnival's Pixie Kingdom have advantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in the garden.

***Animal Pens.*** The pens contain seven **goats**, five adult pigs (use the **boar** stat block), and a Small piglet (noncombatant) named Oink, who is beloved by Philomena (see area L4).

***Compost Heap.*** The compost heap is a **shambling mound** that remains motionless until it is disturbed or until it rises to attack. If the mound is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the mound moving or acting, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to discern that the mound is animate.

Granny Nightshade earlier took a cutting from the shambling mound's root stem, binding it to her service. If a character uses a *speak with plants* spell to communicate with the shambling mound, it tells the character that the creature must obey the hag until its stolen root is returned to it. If a character promises to return the root to it, the shambling mound stops attacking and waits here for the characters to come back. If the root is brought back and given to it, the shambling mound goes on a rampage through the garden, destroying and devouring everything it can while leaving the characters and their allies unmolested, then shambles into the forest, never to return. The cutting can be found inside one of the cookbooks in area L13.

***Mushrooms and Toadstools.*** Granny Nightshade grows many kinds of Feywild fungi, five of which have useful (and in some cases magical) properties. Roll 3d8 to determine how many of each mushroom can be harvested from this location. A character who examines a certain kind of mushroom can, with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check, ascertain its properties:

- **Butterfly Saddle** Each of these bright yellow toadstools has a ruffled, saddle-shaped cap properly sized for a pixie or sprite to sit on. They taste like butter and can be used as a substitute for that ingredient in recipes.
- **Eldercap** Eating one of these white and gray mushrooms causes the eater to look much older for 1 hour. This magical effect is an illusion that can be ended with a *dispel magic* spell.
- **Executioner's Hood** Each of these mushrooms has a black, hood-shaped cap. Any creature that consumes an executioner's hood must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death. This magical effect is identical to that of the *feign death* spell (including its duration).
- **Hummingbrella** A hummingbrella is a colorful mushroom with a frilly, parasol-shaped cap that drips sweet nectar and attracts hummingbirds. Eating one has the same effect as drinking antitoxin.
- **Pricklenoggin** Each of these mushrooms has short, prickly spines growing out of its red cap. Hats made from pricklenoggin caps are popular in the fey courts and considered very fashionable. Most tiny Fey would be grateful to receive one as a gift.

![[065-03-007.fungus.png|right|300]]

***Plant Beds.*** Many plants grow in Granny Nightshade's garden—licorice, sugarcane, marshmallow, and more. Characters who examine the plant beds discover a dark secret: each bed is nourished by the buried remains of a Humanoid. Mud-encrusted skulls protrude from the soil, with vegetation sprouting from their open jaws and eye sockets. As an action once per day, Granny Nightshade can raise eight **skeletons** from the earth, but she must be within 30 feet of the plant beds to use this power.

***Pumpkin Patch and Staircase.*** Several large pumpkins grow in one spot amid thick, leafy vines. A wooden staircase on the edge of the pumpkin patch ascends to a 20-foot-high wooden balcony outside area L8.

If a creature other than Granny Nightshade or a Small Humanoid (such as a human child or a halfling) enters the pumpkin patch, three fat pumpkins burst open, and a **giant poisonous snake** slithers out of each of them. Granny Nightshade has cast an *awaken* spell on each of these snakes, giving it an Intelligence score of 10 and the ability to speak Common. Their names are Essaveth, Jahassi, and Sinius. They act as watchdogs, but they won't climb stairs. If one of these snakes is wounded, it slithers into the pumpkin patch on its next turn, gaining total cover. On subsequent turns, it tries to hide and has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as the pumpkin patch provides cover.

***Screaming Scarecrows.*** Five scarecrows are staked in a line near the pumpkin patch, and a *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each one. If an intruder moves within 50 feet of any of them, all five scarecrows scream loudly enough to alert everyone inside Loomlurch. Each scarecrow is a Medium object with AC 11, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

### L6. Rocking Horse
The door to area L11 is locked, and Granny Nightshade has the only key (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter). If Skabatha has been forced to flee Loomlurch on her flying rocking horse, modify the following boxed text to remove all mention of the horse:

>>Creaking softly, a rocking horse moves back and forth near the door. Peeling paint covers its limbs, and its rocker is thick with moss. A rictus grin is painted on its face. Near a protruding root is a painted wooden box three feet on a side. A crank protrudes from one side of it, causing it to resemble an oversized jack-in-the-box.
>>

The rocking horse is actually a **flying rocking horse** (see the accompanying stat block) that Granny Nightshade uses to soar across Prismeer. The horse is positioned so that it can attack trespassers who approach the door. Any character who gets within 5 feet of the rocking horse notices a depression on its forehead. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence check correctly intuits that a horn once protruded from this depression.

The rocking horse used to be a unicorn named Elidon until the hags of the Hourglass Coven turned it into an obedient Construct. If a character finds Elidon's lost unicorn horn and places it on the rocking horse's brow while the horse has at least 1 hit point remaining, the curse is broken and the rocking horse magically transforms into the **unicorn** Elidon, who appears at full health. Elidon is happy to repay the characters for their heroism but is equally eager to return to his mate, Lamorna (see "Wayward Pool" earlier in the chapter). Convincing him to join the party requires a successful DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

![[066-637677439290543113.png|right|300]]

Whether he stays with the party or not, Elidon intends to honor the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*) and offers to use his magic to aid the characters in the following ways before parting company with them:

- He can use his Healing Touch action to treat a character's wounds and remove any poisons or diseases afflicting that character.
- Once a day, he can teleport himself and up to three willing party members to any location in Thither up to 1 mile away.
- He can cast *pass without trace* on himself and the entire party at will. This spell requires Elidon's concentration and lasts for up to 1 hour.

***Dragon-in-the-Box.*** The wooden box with the crank is one of the boxes where **Cradlefall** might be found (see "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter).

### L7. Tin Soldier Barracks

>>Ten brightly painted structures resembling little wooden houses line the walls of this room. Each small house has a three-foot-high hinged door. Four of the doors are open, and the other six are closed.
>>
>>A narrow staircase ascends the circular wall. Near the foot of the stairs is a painted wooden box three feet on a side. A crank protrudes from one side of it, causing it to resemble an oversized jack-in-the-box.
>>

The staircase ends after 20 feet at a landing outside area L8.

Each small house is designed to hold one of Granny Nightshade's **tin soldiers**. When the characters arrive, four soldiers are on patrol in areas L8 and L12, and the remaining six tin soldiers are inside their domiciles, behind closed doors. Each of these six Constructs is a Small (3-foot-tall) suit of **animated armor** with 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points.

The tin soldiers burst from their small houses and march forth if they hear combat in this room or an adjoining area, or if Skabatha or Pincushion calls for them. If the characters witness the soldiers emerge, read:

>>The beat of a drum erupts from out of the woodwork as all six small doors spring open at once. A troop of cask-shaped tin soldiers marches into view. A drum waddles behind one of them on stocky legs, striking itself with a pair of tiny drumstick arms.
>>

The six tin soldiers operate as a unit and march to the beat of the drum, which is a Small animated object with AC 16, 25 hit points, a walking speed of 30 feet, blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, and no effective attacks. Its ability scores are Strength 6, Dexterity 14, Constitution 10, Intelligence 3, Wisdom 3, and Charisma 1. The drum can't be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, and it's immune to poison and psychic damage. Its drumbeat can be heard out to a range of 60 feet. All tin soldiers that can hear the beating drum gain a +2 bonus to their damage rolls. If the drum is destroyed, every tin soldier within 60 feet of it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

***Dragon-in-the-Box.*** The wooden box with the crank is one of the boxes where **Cradlefall** might be found (see "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter).

![[067-03-008.march-of-the-tin-soldiers.png|right|300]]

### L8. Workhouse Dormitory
Two 3-foot-tall tin soldiers patrol the balcony outside this room. Each **tin soldier** is a Small suit of **animated armor** with 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points. The doors leading to this room are closed but unlocked.

>>This dormitory nestles in the tree boughs and has round windows overlooking a wooden balcony. Lining the walls are ten child-sized bunks outfitted with patchwork quilts and straw-stuffed pillows.
>>
>>A young male dwarf lies in one of the bunks, coughing and drenched in sweat, while an older lad mops his brow with water from a bucket. Two doors exit the room: one leads to a balcony, the other deeper into the tree.
>>

Granny Nightshade's workers sleep in these bunks. When the characters arrive, two children are present: Brottor (a 10-year-old male hill dwarf) and Pud (a 12-year-old male human). Brottor is poisoned; he fell gravely ill after eating nightshade from the garden. Pud has been assigned to care for him until the malady passes or Brottor dies.

Pud hisses for the characters to be quiet, nodding toward the soldiers on the balcony. If the characters comply, Pud quietly describes Granny Nightshade's routine and all of her minions (see Where's Skabatha? and "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter). Characters who are suspicious of Pud can make a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check; on a successful check, a character discerns that Pud is untrustworthy. (In fact, he's deciding whether to betray the characters to the hag.) If one or more characters are mean to him, Pud slips off at the first opportunity to alert Skabatha, hoping that his loyalty to her will pay off for him in the future.

***Curing Brottor.*** Any effect that neutralizes poison can cure Brottor. If the characters lack the means to cure Brottor on their own, they can use hummingbrella mushrooms (found in areas L5 and L13) to neutralize the poison.

If his ailment remains untreated, the dwarf falls into a coma after 5 hours. A character who administers to the dwarf for 1 hour and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check can delay the onset of the coma for an additional 1d4 + 1 hours.

If the characters save Brottor's life, Pud silently vows not to betray them to the hag.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the dormitory uncover the following valuable items:

- A silver bookmark shaped like a feather (5 gp)
- A gold signet ring depicting a weeping willow (25 gp)
- A cracked bloodstone (25 gp) stuffed inside a pillowcase

### L9. Sewing Room
A closed, unlocked door connects this room to a 5-foot-high wooden balcony that overlooks Granny Nightshade's garden (area L5).

>>"Dunderhead!" cries a scratchy voice as you enter this cluttered chamber. "Those tatty sleeves wouldn't serve as socks for a chicken. Start again!"
>>
>>A plump halfling boy and a young, fluffy bugbear sit at work benches, watched over by a living, child-sized doll with buttons for eyes. An animated carpet prances around the children, who pay it no attention. The sewing room contains rolls of fabric, bobbins of thread, knitting needles, and pincushions.
>>

Materials for the workshop are sewn here under the watchful gaze of Pincushion, a **living doll** (see *appendix C* for its stat block). The prancing carpet is a **rug of smothering** that defends Pincushion and keeps strangers away from the children. Pincushion carries a key that locks and unlocks the doors to the kitchen (area L13). The key dangles from a hoop attached to its waist.

The living doll challenges intruders and demands to know why they're trespassing here. To satisfy it, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check. On a failed check, Pincushion hollers for the tin soldiers at area L7. If satisfied, Pincushion asks the characters to wait here while it hurries to notify Skabatha of the newcomers' presence. The rug stays behind to make sure the children don't leave. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Pincushion.

***Children.*** Two children are working here when the characters arrive: Wendel (an 11-year-old male strongheart halfling) and Roff (a 10-year-old female bugbear). Roff recently stole a pouch of *dust of corrosion* (see *appendix A*) from the store cupboard in area L10. She conceals the pouch in her clothing and offers it to her saviors if rescued from the tyranny of Pincushion and the rug.

***Treasure.*** Once the living doll leaves or is defeated, the characters can search the sewing room for treasure, finding the following valuable items:

- A spool of barbed, golden yarn (15 gp)
- Three bolts of silk in shades of putrid green and cesspit brown (10 gp each)
- A set of five painted thimbles depicting poisonous Feywild plants (25 gp for the set)

### L10. Cupboards
The doors in this chamber are closed but not locked. When the characters enter for the first time, read:

>>Moths cluster around a lantern that hangs from the ceiling in the middle of a hallway, casting flitting shadows on the walls. The hall contains three sliding doors along the walls, and a heavier hinged door stands at the opposite end.
>>

The three cupboards, accessed by sliding the doors open, hold workshop supplies, boxes of junk, and other mundane bric-a-brac. If one or more characters spend at least 15 minutes searching a cupboard, they find 1d4 trinkets inside it (each one determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets table in the *introduction*).

***Large Cupboard.*** If the characters didn't dispose of her in chapter 1, Sowpig stands in the middle of the largest cupboard, silent and unmoving. She is a Small **ghoul** with 17 (5d6) hit points. Moths that live in the cupboard have encased Sowpig's body in silk. Opening the cupboard door releases a swarm of moths, which is harmless and always moves toward the nearest light source. Any space that it occupies is lightly obscured.

After the swarm has been released, Sowpig emerges from her silk cocoon to ask why she has been disturbed. The ghoul assumes that the characters are Granny Nightshade's workers, sent to fetch her for a new task. She has no interest in the day-to-day affairs of Loomlurch and attacks the characters only if they threaten Granny Nightshade in the ghoul's presence or seem particularly suspicious. Sowpig follows them through the lair and shares an occasional joke, which is always dark and upsetting. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Sowpig.

***Unicorn Horn.*** If the *Story Tracker* indicates that the unicorn horn is here, characters can find it in Sowpig's cupboard, buried in a box full of junk.

### L11. Family Tree
The door to L10 is closed but not locked, and the doors to areas L6 and L13 are both locked. Granny Nightshade carries keys to both of these doors (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter), and Pincushion (see area L9) has a spare key to area L13. The staircase in this room climbs 20 feet to a landing that ends outside area L12.

>>This room has three doors and a wood-carved staircase that ascends to a higher level. The walls are a dense tangle of tree roots and brambles, nestled among which are five animated portraits: one of a svelte, dark-haired woman and the others depicting hags.
>>

When the characters arrive, the portraits show images of Granny Nightshade and her family, with no labels to identify them:

- A truly ancient and terrifying hag (Baba Yaga, the Mother of Witches)
- A toadish hag (**Bavlorna Blightstraw**, as depicted in *appendix B*)
- A skeletal hag wearing a black, theatrical contraption resembling a dress (**Endelyn Moongrave**, as depicted in appendix B)
- A hag with a wind-up key in her back, one empty eye socket, and a wooden eye held in her hand (**Skabatha Nightshade**, as depicted in appendix B)
- A svelte, dark-haired woman with a commanding presence (her appearance matching that of the Tasha mannequin outside the Hall of Illusions in the Witchlight Carnival, as described in chapter 1)

The portraits are enchanted to display the last creature that pricked its skin on the brambles' thorns in addition to its four closest family members, if it has any. These family members can be living or dead. (If the creature has fewer than four close family members, any remaining portraits are blank.) Each portrait magically animates to create the impression that the subject is looking around and shifting uncomfortably, but the animation has the quality of an old movie. The moving images are silent.

![[068-03-009.magical-portrait.png|right|300]]

***Pricking Thorns.*** Any creature that reaches toward a portrait must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be pricked by the thorny brambles. The prick deals no damage, but the portraits change to match the pricked creature and up to four of its closest family members.

### L12. Textile Mill
Two 3-foot-tall tin soldiers patrol the balcony outside this room, guarding against outside intruders. Each one is a Small suit of **animated armor** with 27 (6d6 + 6) hit points. Both doors to this room are closed but not locked. The tin soldiers open the door and enter the room if they hear any commotion within.

>>Three large, freestanding looms dominate this chamber. A young goblin and a pair of gnome children work the machines, filling the room with a loud, rhythmic clatter. A door is set in the opposite wall, and an archway to the east leads to a storeroom.
>>

Each night, **Skabatha Nightshade** (see appendix B) visits the textile mill to check up on her workers (see Where's Skabatha? earlier in the chapter). The looms are used to weave fabric for the sewing room and the workshop. They are large, treadle-driven machines that generate a considerable racket. The storeroom contains spools of yarn.

***Boggles.*** Three **boggles** (see *appendix C*) play tricks on the child workers when no one else is around. The boggles are hidden in the corners of the room when the characters arrive, though the children shoot fearful glances at the boggles in the hope that the characters will notice what's going on. A character can use an action to try to spot the hidden boggles, doing so with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. Because of the children's fearful glances, the characters have advantage on this check. The boggles avoid combat, surrendering if they face certain harm.

If Squirt is with the party, it encourages the characters to acquire as much slippery boggle oil as they can (see the "Boggle Oil" sidebar earlier in the chapter). Captured boggles provide the oil freely, hoping to earn their freedom.

***Children.*** Three children are working here when the characters arrive: Yevelda (an 8-year-old female goblin), Callybon (an 11-year-old female forest gnome), and her brother, Pogo (a 9-year-old male forest gnome). The children are eager to escape Loomlurch but won't converse with strangers until the area is cleared of boggles.

If the characters ask the children for help navigating the hag's lair, Yevelda reveals that she knows a secret route into Skabatha's bedroom (area L16). To take that route, a character must climb out of the storeroom window, clamber across branches that grow out of the upright trees and pass above area L13, and then hop onto the windowsill of the hag's bedroom. To reach the windowsill, a character must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failed check, the character falls 20 feet onto the roof of area L13, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.

On one of her forays into the hag's private quarters, Yevelda witnessed Pud (see area L8) reporting to the hag. She hasn't told anyone about this yet and is unwilling to share her knowledge about the secret route to area L16 while Pud is present.

***Treasure.*** Searching the storeroom reveals the following items of value:

- A gold bodkin (2 gp)
- A pouch holding 35 sp (the coins' mintage is unfamiliar to the characters)
- A small, leather-bound book containing delicate sketches and watercolor paintings of pixies, sprites, and other Fey (50 gp)

### L13. Granny Nightshade's Kitchen
The door to L14 is ajar, and the doors to areas L11 and L15 are locked. Granny Nightshade carries a key that locks and unlocks all three doors (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter), as does Pincushion (see area L9).

>>This squalid kitchen is carved out of the trunk of the fallen oak. A large clay oven sits in the middle of the room, surrounded by crowded shelves laden with forest fungi, jars of pickled grubs, animal skulls, and moldy cookbooks. Sickly-sweet vapors emerge from a cauldron that rests atop the oven.
>>
>>A young human girl shackled to a worktable is hard at work peeling potatoes. Set into the floor nearby is a padlocked iron grate through which you hear a gruff male voice say, "Are those potatoes I smell?"
>>

Cradlefall, the **green dragon wyrmling**, spends much of his time dozing in here by the oven. If the characters have not encountered the wyrmling elsewhere, read:

>>A green dragon the size of a large dog is coiled up near the oven, apparently dozing. Fumes rise from the wyrmling's nostrils.
>>

Each afternoon, **Skabatha Nightshade** (see appendix B) spends most of her time in this room with occasional visits to the study (area L14). She uses the kitchen to boil candy and prepare potions. The hag treats Cradlefall like her beloved pet; if Skabatha is not present, the wyrmling flees to her side and reports that intruders are in the kitchen.

***Child Worker.*** Mishka (a 9-year-old female human) serves Granny Nightshade as a scullery maid. Mishka has managed to escape from Loomlurch twice, only to be tracked down by Cradlefall and recaptured both times; that's why Granny Nightshade now chains her to the worktable. As an action, a character using thieves' tools can pick the lock on Mishka's ankle cuff with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Any key that unlocks the kitchen doors also unlocks Mishka's chains.

If Skabatha isn't present, Mishka tells the characters about the hag's daily routine and describes Granny Nightshade's minions (see Where's Skabatha? and "Skabatha's Minions" earlier in the chapter). She suggests that they lure Granny Nightshade into the oven and burn her up.

***Oven.*** This oven is large enough to cook a Medium creature whole. A 5-foot-wide iron door in the front of the oven allows one to reach into the oven's interior without disturbing the fuming cauldron that rests atop it. The oven's flames are produced by a **fire elemental** that is bound inside the clay enclosure. Its coal-black eyes are visible inside the flames to anyone who peers inside the oven. While it is trapped in this manner, the elemental can't be targeted or harmed directly.

Any creature that enters the hot oven or starts its turn inside it takes 10 (2d6 + 3) fire damage. A character can try to shove a Medium or smaller creature into the oven, if the creature is within 5 feet of the oven's open door (see "*Shoving a Creature*" in the *Player's Handbook*). If the creature is looking into the oven when it is shoved, the Strength (Athletics) check to shove the creature is made with advantage.

The oven is a Large object with AC 13, 30 hit points, vulnerability to cold damage, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. If the oven is reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, the elemental escapes from captivity and occupies an open space next to the oven. The elemental waits in the kitchen for Granny Nightshade to appear, then attacks her. It attacks the characters only if they harm it.

***Trapdoor and Cell.*** A 3-foot-square, padlocked iron grate covers a 5-foot-deep, 5-foot-wide cell built into the kitchen floor. The walls of the cell are made of 1-foot-thick clay bricks held together with mortar. Granny Nightshade carries the padlock's only key (see "Skabatha's Ring of Keys" earlier in the chapter). As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to pick the lock, doing so with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check. As an action, a character can try to pull open the trapdoor without removing the padlock, doing so with a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check.

Skabatha imprisons her most hated enemies inside the cell, which is filled with muddy water to a depth of 3 feet. The cell currently holds a bedraggled and grumpy dwarf named **Elkhorn** (see appendix B), one of the members of the adventuring band known as Valor's Call. If Rubin Sugarwood was lured through the mirror in the Witchlight Carnival's Hall of Illusions, the characters also find him in the cell, still wearing smeared butterfly face paint. Rubin angered the hag, and she has promised to "plant him in her garden" when she has a new plot of ground ready.

If **Elkhorn** is freed, he provides the following information to his rescuers:

- **Elkhorn** and his four human companions entered Prismeer to confront their archenemy, the League of Malevolence. **Elkhorn**'s companions included **Strongheart** the paladin, **Mercion** the cleric, **Molliver** the rogue, and **Ringlerun** the wizard. Their group is known as Valor's Call.
- The League of Malevolence is a coalition of villains: **Kelek** the sorcerer, **Warduke** the helmed swordsman, **Skylla** the warlock, a priest of Orcus named **Zargash**, and **Zarak** the assassin. Valor's Call caught up with the League of Malevolence in the Palace of Heart's Desire, home of the archfey Zybilna. The two groups fought a mighty battle, during which **Elkhorn** believes he was knocked out. He woke up here, in Loomlurch.
- Granny Nightshade has lost interest in **Elkhorn** and is not concerned if he starves to death. The children toss him scraps of food to keep him alive.

**Elkhorn** happily joins the characters if he is freed from the cell. He's wearing his armor, and his shield and sword are stuffed in a kitchen cupboard (see "Treasure" below), though he doesn't know that. The old dwarf is determined to free the children of Loomlurch from captivity and ensure their safekeeping until they can be returned to their families. His duty in this regard overpowers even his longing to find out what happened to his adventuring companions; if the children are rescued, **Elkhorn** rounds them up and cares for them.

When **Elkhorn** and his friends first arrived in Prismeer, they traveled to the Palace of Heart's Desire by following the stone causeway that once stretched from the palace to the edge of the domain. This route has since been shattered. He knows of no other way to reach the palace.

***Cauldron.*** The cauldron is nearly full of hot melted candy, which bubbles gently. As an action, a creature can spill the cauldron's contents onto another creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 (1d4) fire damage; in addition, the creature is covered with a sticky, crunchy candy coating that is easily washed off with water.

***Cookbooks.*** Granny Nightshade has several cookbooks in her kitchen that contain candy recipes. One of these books has a 1-foot-long piece of gnarled root as a bookmark; this object is the cutting that Granny Nightshade took from the shambling mound in area L5.

Characters can also find a cookbook that contains formulas for common and uncommon potions. A character can brew such a potion by following the rules for crafting magic items in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

***Treasure.*** Searching Granny Nightshade's kitchen reveals the following treasures:

- Six brass egg cups embossed with the faces of crying children (5 gp each)
- An ornate eight-minute hourglass (75 gp)
- A moldy wooden coffer labeled "Mushrooms" (in Elvish) that contains two butterfly saddles and a hummingbrella (see area L5 for descriptions of these mushrooms)

In addition, **Elkhorn**'s *shield* and *+1 longsword* can be found inside a small cupboard.

### L14. Study
The door to area L13 is ajar. The staircase in this room climbs 20 feet to area L16.

>>A staircase runs along the wall of this circular room and climbs to an upper level. Tucked behind curtains of moss and ivy are numerous bookshelves bearing ancient tomes, and built into one of the bookcases is a tall oval mirror in a wooden frame. Flickering candlelight emanates from the eye sockets of a human skull resting on an open rolltop desk.
>>

**Skabatha Nightshade** spends part of her day here (see Where's Skabatha? earlier in the chapter); if present, she is seated at the writing desk and scribbling notes to herself while cursing various "unappreciative" child workers under her breath. If **Bavlorna Blightstraw** fled Downfall in *chapter 2*, she is slumped against the wall under the stairs and consumed with self-pity. She's in no mood to fight or have a conversation, so she mumbles and curses to herself, attacking only in self-defense. Both hags' stat blocks appear in *appendix B*.

The shelves contain books of Feywild lore, all written in Elvish, each of which has a withered frog's body stitched into its spine. Kissing the frog or stroking it with a moistened finger causes the frog to croak the book's title in Elvish. Notable tomes include the following:

*All Things Sticky, Slippery, and Sweet*, written for children, illustrates and describes substances that would fascinate them, such as boggle oil, troll spittle, and various flavors of tree sap.

*Fantasma Demento's Codicil of Conundrums* is a lavishly illustrated book of fey puzzles and riddles. Answers to the puzzles and riddles are written in invisible ink.

*gobliN eht fo hguaL tsaL* is a thin, illustrated book describing nilbogs, who are capricious fey spirits that possess goblins, foment chaos in goblinoid society, and use their magic to drive others to do the opposite of what they desire. All the book's writing is backward.

*Pity He's an Elf* is a collection of illustrated short stories about an elf adventurer named Aethyn Ourglas, who travels the Feywild and befriends dangerous creatures in surprising ways.

*The Queen's Gowns* depicts and describes famous gowns worn by the Summer Queen, with asides written by the gowns' equally famous designers.

*Tales from the Gloaming Court* is a set of eleven hefty, green-covered, illustrated books filled with stories and illustrations of Feywild intrigue that shed light on the Seelie and Unseelie courts. (Volumes 3 and 8 are missing from Skabatha's collection and can be found in *chapter 4*.)

*Three Rules to Rule By* is a thin, dog-eared book that describes the rules of hospitality, ownership, and reciprocity in detail (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*).

*Twilight Tides* is a fat, wrinkled book about navigating the oceans of the Feywild.

After two books were stolen from her collection (volumes 3 and 8 of *Tales from the Gloaming Court*), Skabatha placed wards on every one of the remaining books. Any book that is removed from her study turns to ashes instantly. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each book.

Shelved among the books are hundreds of scrolls that bear no magical wards; they describe encounters with individuals who struck bargains with Skabatha, and the horrible curses she put on each of them for failing to uphold their end.

***Magic Mirror.*** The oval mirror built into one of the bookcases functions like the magic mirror in area B1 of Bavlorna's cottage (see chapter 2).

***Rolltop Desk.*** This desk contains quills, ink, a human skull fashioned into a lantern, a treasure (see "Treasure" below), and a rolled-up wanted poster bearing a sketch of Will of the Feywild, along with the following text in Common:

>>*Wanted: Will of the Feywild*!
>>
>>*Find this flibbertigibbet and deliver him to me alive and unharmed, and I shall make you as strong as an octopus!*
>>
>>*Granny Nightshade*
>>

Any character who can rightfully claim this reward is better off not doing so, for it comes in the form of a potion that, if drunk, gives the imbiber a Strength score of 4 (the strength of a normal **octopus**). The effect lasts until the creature receives the benefit of a *remove curse* spell, a *greater restoration* spell, or similar magic.

***Treasure.*** Among the junk in the rolltop desk are the following interesting items:

- A varnished human eyeball inside the lower half of a small hourglass that hangs like a pendant from a necklace made of woven hair. This is the Hourglass Coven's *hag eye* (described in the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the *Monster Manual*).
- A black-feathered quill with a bone tip that magically produces its own ink (150 gp). The ink is the crimson color of fresh blood until it dries, whereupon its color changes to sepia.
- A Tiny clockwork toad with AC 5 and 1 hit point. If a creature places the toad on the ground, it hops 5 feet across the ground on each of the creature's turns in a random direction and makes a croaking noise that can be heard out to a range of 30 feet. Any creature that licks the clockwork toad must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. While the creature is poisoned in this way, other creatures are invisible to it.

### L15. Redcap Patch

>>To one side of the giant, toppled tree is a grove of bearded willows on the bank of a murky woodland pond. A patch of tilled earth spreads beneath their boughs. The caps of several red toadstools are just beginning to emerge from the loam.
>>

The toadstools are the tips of the hats worn by six **redcaps** (see *appendix C*) that are forming under the earth. Any creature that tries to pick a toadstool causes its redcap to rise up out of the earth, outraged at being awakened early. This redcap is not fully formed and has half its normal hit points.

Whenever Granny Nightshade's key stops turning, 1d3 redcaps emerge fully grown from this patch, leaving any remaining redcaps under the soil, still not fully formed. The risen redcaps loiter here until they see something they can kill or until Granny Nightshade gives them a mission.

The redcaps are hostile toward creatures other than Granny Nightshade. However, if a redcap is offered a gift, it accepts the gift and becomes so angry at the thought of having to reciprocate (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*) that it clutches its chest and keels over dead at the start of its next turn.

### L16. Granny Nightshade's Bedroom
This room has two closed doors, one leading to a 20-foot-high balcony and the other leading to area L17. Neither door is locked. A staircase descends to area L14.

>>Almost everything about this bedroom is orderly, from the bed with the patchwork quilt to the ornamental pigs arranged in a neat row on the dresser. Such tidiness is at odds, however, with the decaying dollhouse sitting on the bedside table. This three-foot-tall edifice has seen better days and is now besmirched by peeling paint, mold, and rot.
>>
>>Behind the dollhouse, by the window, moths flutter inside a large bell jar. Facing one another along the outer wall are a pair of doors. Next to the door closest to the staircase is a wooden rocking cradle with a neatly folded blanket in it.
>>

If **Skabatha Nightshade** (see appendix B) is here, she is asleep inside the dollhouse in her miniaturized form. While Granny Nightshade is sleeping, a character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check to sneak up on her without waking her. Talking near the dollhouse also awakens her.

The dollhouse is fully enclosed, rather than being open at the back as a normal dollhouse would be. A Tiny creature can enter the dollhouse through its front door or one of its windows and explore its interior, which has a gloomy foyer, parlor, kitchen, and dining room on the ground floor; two bedrooms, a sewing room, and a nonfunctional bath on the second floor; and a spooky, spacious attic. If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook and Granny Nightshade stole from the characters, any items that their lost things were transformed into are kept inside the dollhouse's attic, along with the items listed in the "Treasure" section below.

Characters who inspect the outside of the dollhouse closely can see that the roof is hinged, like the lid of a toybox. It is held shut by an *arcane lock* spell that only Granny Nightshade can bypass without using magic. No amount of brute force will open the sealed roof, but a *knock* spell or similar magic opens it, granting access to the attic and its contents. Granny Nightshade also set a password ("rumpleclump") that, when spoken within 5 feet of the dollhouse, suppresses the *arcane lock* spell for 1 minute. Cradlefall and Pincushion know the password but won't divulge it unless their very existence is threatened. Mishka (see area L13) also knows the password and shares it with any characters who are willing to help her.

Creatures inside the dollhouse can't be affected by spells or attacks that originate outside the dollhouse, and the dollhouse is enchanted to be immune to all damage. If it is knocked over, each creature inside the dollhouse must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage from colliding with walls, furniture, and junk.

***Jar of Moths.*** Granny Nightshade keeps these moths to ameliorate the effect of her curse: after she wakes each morning, she forgets all about the first creature she sees. This means that Granny Nightshade doesn't think about the creature, doesn't see it in front of her, and instantly forgets anything it says. The effect lasts until she finishes her next long rest or until she takes damage from the creature, at which point she remembers everything. So, to lessen the risk to herself, Granny Nightshade placed the jar of moths where it would be the first thing she sees when she emerges from her dollhouse each morning.

***Rocking Cradle.*** This cradle is painted with images of green dragons. It belongs to Cradlefall, though the wyrmling has outgrown it. It contains a folded, threadbare blanket.

***Treasure.*** The attic of the dollhouse contains the following valuable items:

- A pair of embroidered velvet slippers (15 gp)
- A false eye made of solid gold (25 gp)
- A cracked hand mirror with a gaudy, bejeweled handle and frame (65 gp)

![[069-03-010.skabathas-dollhouse.png|right|300]]

### L17. Aviary
The door to area L16 is closed but not locked.

>>Old, empty birdhouses are nailed to the walls of this cramped room, and a dozen birdcages hang from the ceiling. The cages are filled with tiny clockwork sparrows. As the birds' gears turn, the air thrums with rhythmic ticking. Paper and quills are heaped on a small writing desk under the cages. A pair of open windows overlook the forest beyond. Carved into the wall above one window is the word "Hither," and above the other is the word "Yon."
>>

Granny Nightshade uses the mechanical sparrows to relay messages to her sisters. The sparrows use the **hawk** stat block but are Constructs that are immune to poison and psychic damage; the effects of exhaustion; and the charmed, frightened, petrified, and poisoned conditions.

The sparrows have their names engraved on their breasts. (Example names include Glyff, Pim, and Zwee. Create others as needed.) If a creature speaks a sparrow's name aloud and gives it a task, it flies off as though affected by an *animal messenger* spell. In addition to delivering spoken messages, a mechanical sparrow can also carry written letters.

***Writing Desk.*** The writing desk contains three letters, two from Bavlorna and one from Endelyn:

>*Sister*,
>
>*I don't have Elidon's horn. If I did, I would use it to free Bloodybeak and send it after the jabberwock that lairs in the palace and hunts in your forest. No matter what Endelyn says, that burbling beast of a dragon is a threat to our coven and our three realms. How Zybilna managed to befriend it, I'll never know! Maybe we should ask her—ha ha.Much love*,
>
>*Lorna*
>

>*Lovely Skab*,
>
>*The last time I saw the unicorn horn, it was in your possession. Pity you lost it. But fret not! I have gazed into the Orrery of Tragedies, and it has revealed to me that Elidon's horn will be found*.
>
>*If worse comes to worst, recall that Elidon's mate still dwells in your forest. You could kill Lamorna and take her horn—assuming, of course, you're not too busy making toys*.
>
>*Your darling sister*,
>
>*End*
>

>*Dear Sister*,
>
>*There's no use asking Endelyn if she has the horn. She doesn't tell us anything! But if we don't find it soon, I fear what the jabberwock will do after it gets tired of prowling the forest and turns its fiery gaze elsewhere. Gods' bodkins, that thing gives me nightmares*!
>
>*Must I remind you that we need a unicorn's horn to free creatures from the cauldron's time-freezing magic? It's not enough to know their true names, you know. Of course, my greater concern is that someone else finds the horn and uses it for exactly that purpose. What do you think Zybilna will do to us, we treacherous three, if she's no longer bound by her cauldron's magic*?
>
>*Your beloved sister*,
>
>*Lorna*
>

## From Thither to Yon
At any time, Squirt can lead the characters through the mists of Prismeer to the mountains of Yon. If the characters have not yet encountered Squirt, steer them to Little Oak or have the treant come to them. If Squirt was lost or destroyed, choose another creature to serve as their guide to Yon. Little Oak would be a fine choice.

![[070-03-011.forest-of-thither.jpg|right|300]]
---
# Yon
**Endelyn Moongrave**, the Dame of Unhappy Endings, presides over this realm, and her penchant for theatrics has transformed the land around her. Storm clouds roil, shadows take on a life of their own, and the air is filled with a sense of impending dread.

Carved into the realm's tallest pinnacle is Motherhorn, Endelyn's theater, where hapless souls come seeking hope, only to leave after stark revelations of decline and despair—if they leave at all.

![[071-04-001.chapter-splash.jpg|right|300]]

## Running This Chapter
In this chapter, the characters navigate the bleak mountains of Yon, searching for their lost things or a route to the Palace of Heart's Desire.

Before your first game session in Yon, follow these steps to help make the players' experience as entertaining as possible:

- Yon is ruled by **Endelyn Moongrave**, also known as Bitter End, Creeping Lyn, and the Dame of Unhappy Endings. Read the hag's description and skim her stat block in appendix B.
- Read this chapter in its entirety, and reacquaint yourself with the "Prismeer Overview" in *chapter 2*.
- Look over the *map* of Yon. Locations marked on the map are described later in the chapter.

Before the characters arrive at Motherhorn, make a copy of Stagefright's lines of dialogue in *appendix E*, then cut them into strips and place the strips in an opaque container such as a paper bag or a plastic Halloween cauldron. See "A Tragedy in the Making" later in the chapter for how Stagefright's lines come into play.

### Lost Things in Yon
If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook, check the *Story Tracker* to see if **Endelyn Moongrave** has anything or anyone the characters seek to reclaim. When the characters enter Yon, anyone who had something stolen by the hag gets the nagging sensation that it is somewhere in this realm, though the character doesn't know where. The feeling fades when the character either regains what was lost or leaves Yon without recovering it. Anything the characters might want returned to them is kept in area M22.

### Navigating Yon
Using the map of Yon as a reference, describe what the characters see as they forge their path through the splinter-realm. Yon's numerous lightning rods and the other landmarks detailed in the "Encounters in Yon" section sit atop high peaks and plateaus and are easily spied from a distance.

Shortly after arriving in Yon, the characters encounter a talking dandelion named Amidor, who knows its way around Yon, where the characters might stumble upon one or more of the following locations:

- Lockbury Henge, a meeting place for **korreds** (see *appendix C*) who can give directions to Brigganock Mine
- Brigganock Mine, where wish stones are unearthed by tiny creatures called **brigganocks** (see *appendix C*)
- Pillars of rock called the Fey Beacons, which are clearly visible from Lockbury Henge

One route to the Palace of Heart's Desire lies in Motherhorn's belfry, which contains a silver bell that summons giant cranes when it is rung. These birds serve as flying mounts and can deliver the characters to the palace. The characters can also reach the palace by an overland route, but they need a guide who knows the way. Without a guide, they would become hopelessly lost in the mountains of Yon.

#### Guide from Yon to Hither or the Palace of Heart's Desire
**Amidor**, a swashbuckling dandelion, can guide the characters from Yon to Hither and back to Yon. It also knows a safe overland route to the *Palace of Heart's Desire*. The characters encounter Amidor shortly after arriving in Yon (see "Arrival in Yon" below).

## Features of Yon
Yon is a realm of rocky peaks, thunderclouds, and howling winds. The narrow ledges and footpaths that curl around the mountains make foot travel possible, but such routes are arduous, and dead ends are common. Skittish goats leap and bound across the mountain slopes with ease, but they avoid strangers. To see farther than a mile or two, one must ascend to high ground, where the rain and winds are particularly fierce.

![[073-map-4.1-yon-player.jpg|right|300]]
### Lightning Rods
**Endelyn Moongrave** has erected copper lightning rods on mountaintops throughout Yon and uses them to harness electricity from the storms, which in turn powers the contraptions in her theater. Each lightning rod is 30 feet tall and topped with a 10-foot-diameter symbol of a sun or moon made of copper. Each hour, the rods discharge the electricity they've accumulated, sending arcs of lightning across the sky to lightning rods atop Motherhorn.

Each lightning rod is a Huge object with AC 17, 75 hit points, and immunity to lightning, poison, and psychic damage. A lightning rod has abundant handholds and footholds that allow it to be climbed without a check. It can be toppled by lashing ropes to the top of it and then pulling it over, which requires either a successful DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check or the effort of multiple creatures with a combined Strength of 60 or higher. A rod can't be toppled by pulling or pushing at its base.

## Arrival in Yon
When the characters first arrive in Yon, read:

>>You stand on a path that wends between rocky crags on a mountainside. The sky is dark and full of roiling thunderclouds. You are greeted by a howling wind. For a second, lightning splits the sky, striking nearby mountaintops and illuminating a distant pinnacle of rock that has a foreboding castle carved out of it.
>>

The distant castle is Motherhorn. What direction the characters go is up to them. Whichever way they choose, they don't get far before they encounter another friendly guide.

### Amidor and Gleam
This encounter should take place before the characters have their first random encounter in Yon or reach any of the marked locations on the map of Yon.

>>You see two figures standing on an outcrop of rock, outlined against the stormy sky. One is a slender female elf wearing a crescent moon mask, and the other is a three-foot-tall dandelion with a small rapier strapped to its stem. A honeybee the size of an orange buzzes around the dandelion's bright yellow head.
>>
>>The elf is the first to notice you. As she points in your direction, the dandelion draws its rapier and assumes a defensive pose. The honeybee buzzes more loudly as it flies circles around the two of them.
>>

The creature wielding the rapier is **Amidor**, and its beloved companion is **Pollenella** (see the accompanying stat blocks). The masked figure is Gleam, a high elf acrobat (use the **Selenelion twin** stat block in *appendix C*) from the Witchlight Carnival. Whenever lightning flashes across the dark sky, it's easy to see that Gleam casts no shadow. While she has no shadow, Gleam is cursed (see the "Shadowless" sidebar).

> ##### Shadowless
>A shadowless creature is one that carries the curse of having no shadow—a fact evident only when the creature is in bright or dim light. A *remove curse* spell or similar magic ends the curse on a shadowless creature, reuniting it with its shadow instantly.
>
>Creatures native to Prismeer will not trust or do business with a known shadowless creature or those who ally themselves with one.
>

Characters who met Gleam's **detached shadow** in the Witchlight Carnival notice that Gleam's crescent moon mask has the same shape as the one worn by her shadow.

If the characters seem friendly, Amidor and Gleam beseech them for help. By way of reciprocation, Amidor offers its services as a guide. During the ensuing conversation, Amidor and Gleam freely share the following information:

- Amidor is on the run after freeing Pollenella, a queen bee, from a cyclops beekeeper. The two of them crossed paths with Gleam, and, after hearing the elf's sorry tale, Amidor resolved to help her.
- **Endelyn Moongrave** snipped off Gleam's shadow using a pair of magic scissors and has imprisoned her twin sister, Glister. The rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*) prevents the hag from harming Glister, but Gleam can sense her sister's distress. The twins work as an acrobatic duo, and they used to be star performers in the Witchlight Carnival. Gleam wants to free her sister and find a way back to the carnival—perhaps with the help of the Fey Beacons (see "Fey Beacons" later in the chapter).
- Endelyn believes her own demise will occur during an eclipse. Because there is no moon in the sky over Yon, the hag assumes the eclipse will be a symbolic display, rather than a literal one. Since the Selenelion twins are the living embodiment of the moon and the sun, the hag decided to separate the elf sisters, releasing one while keeping the other as her "guest." By keeping the twins apart, the hag hopes to forestall her doom.

While she was a guest in Motherhorn, Gleam learned the following information, which she shares with characters who promise to help her:

![[074-04-002.amidor-and-pollenella.png|right|300]]

- The mountains are home to clans of korreds—stout Fey creatures whose hair has the strength of iron. The korreds gather and dance at Lockbury Henge. (If the characters don't think of it themselves, Gleam suggests they strike up an alliance with the korreds. See "Lockbury Henge" later in the chapter for how they might accomplish that.)
- An elf prince named **Alagarthas** made a bargain with Endelyn and now finds himself trapped in Yon. He's at the Fey Beacons, searching for a way home (see "Fey Beacons" later in the chapter for more information).
- Hurly, a bugbear, made a bargain with Endelyn and is quite unhappy with how things played out. Now he is forced to perform in her morbid theater. Like Gleam, Hurly used to work for **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light**, though Gleam and her sibling had already left the carnival by the time Hurly and his brother Burly arrived. (Gleam knows that Hurly is eager to see his brother again, and she'd like to help him if she can.)

*Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Amidor and Gleam.

#### Development
Amidor's first concern is Pollenella's safety, but the dandelion also tries to make good on its promises to help Gleam and the characters. Honor dictates that Amidor reunite Gleam with her twin before leading the characters to Hither or the Palace of Heart's Desire.

In addition to serving as the characters' guide in Yon, Amidor acts as the de facto leader of their company of guides, which at this point might also include **Clapperclaw the scarecrow** and **Squirt the oilcan**.

If you feel burdened by all these nonplayer characters, give them responsibilities that don't require a lot of your attention. For example, Clapperclaw's main duty might be to carry Squirt, while Amidor might spend nearly all its time watching over the other guides and whispering sweet nothings to Pollenella. In combat, you can have these supporting characters take the Dodge action or, as circumstances dictate, the Help action. Doing so has the added benefit of making the player characters the centerpiece of the adventure.

### Random Encounters in Yon
A random encounter in Yon occurs whenever you want it to. To determine what the characters encounter, roll a d8 and consult the Random Encounters in Yon table. If you get the same result as a previous roll, choose a different encounter that you think would be fun.

##### Random Encounters in Yon
| d8 | Encounter |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Astronomer's throne |
| 2 | Awakened giant goats |
| 3 | Cyclops beekeeper |
| 4 | Evil kite |
| 5 | Goblin procession |
| 6 | Goblin shadows |
| 7 | Pageant wagon |
| 8 | Tornado |

#### Astronomer's Throne
The characters come across a throne hewn from a boulder and etched with astronomical symbols. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the throne. An inscription in Elvish engraved around the seat of the throne reads:

>*I am a traveler from a distant land.*
>
>*My name is Mazikoth, Keeper of Stars*.
>
>*Sit on my throne, disciple, and unravel.*
>

Any character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana or History) check recalls that Mazikoth was an elf and a celebrated astronomer who claimed to hail from a black star at the edge of night.

A creature that sits on the throne begins to feel cold and drowsy. The first creature that remains seated on the throne for at least 1 minute falls into a magical trance that lasts for 1 hour. While in the trance, the creature is unaware of its surroundings as it dreams of hurtling through space toward a faraway, dead star. At the end of the dream, the creature arrives at the star's cold surface and wakes with a start, having inherited a fragment of Mazikoth's psyche. The creature gains proficiency in one of the following skills (its choice): Arcana, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, or Survival.

Once the throne bestows its gift on a creature, the throne ceases to be magical for one year, during which time nothing happens when a creature sits on it.

#### Awakened Giant Goats
The characters come upon three **giant goats**, each of which has received the benefit of an *awaken* spell, raising its Intelligence score to 10 and granting it the ability to speak Elvish. These goats have silvery-gray fur, wizened faces, and golden, hourglass-shaped pupils that observe the characters closely.

The goats have the ability to hear prophecies and secrets whispered on the wind. Upon seeing the characters, the goats bleat the following:

- The first goat says, "When the moon obstructs the sun, Creeping Lyn will come undone." (This prophecy refers to Endelyn's weakness, as described in appendix B.)
- The second goat says, "Play to her passions. Stay on script. A cat, a horn, or a shadow ripped." (This prophecy refers to Endelyn's desire to have plays performed for her and the three things she's willing to accept as the result of any bargain made with the characters, as discussed in "Bargaining with Endelyn" section later in the chapter.)
- The third goat says, "The fool's scepter is the key." (This statement refers to the scepter that belongs to Stagefright the goblin, which can be used to open the stone door to area M17.)

After speaking these words, the goats wait to see if the characters offer them something in return, thereby honoring the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*). The goats are hungry but not picky eaters, though they admit to being fond of root vegetables. If no reciprocation is forthcoming, either in the form of food or other gifts, all three goats bolt away as a **galeb duhr** erupts from the ground beneath them. This Elemental can't speak and is a manifestation of the Feywild's anger toward the characters. It attacks the party and fights until destroyed. There are plenty of boulders in the area that the galeb duhr can animate using its Animate Boulders action.

![[075-04-003.mudlump.png|right|300]]

#### Cyclops Beekeeper
A **cyclops** beekeeper named Mudlump stumbles upon the characters while he is searching for Pollenella, his lost queen bee. Mudlump wears a hooded veil to protect his eye from bee stings and carries a large beehive on a stick, which doubles as a greatclub. Three times per day, as an action, Mudlump can shake his beehive to bring forth a swarm of bees; treat each one as a **swarm of insects (wasps)**. The swarm attacks Mudlump's enemies.

If Amidor is with the party, the dandelion unsheathes its rapier to defend his beloved honeybee. Upon seeing Amidor, the cyclops roars in Giant, "You stole queen bee! Mudlump needs queen to make honey mead! Best mead in Yon!" Amidor doesn't speak Giant and has no idea what the cyclops is saying, but Mudlump's outrage comes through loud and clear.

Mudlump speaks no language other than Giant. Any character who can communicate with Mudlump can, with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convince him not to attack Amidor or the party. Here are three options for settling the dispute, though clever players can come up with others:

- **Honorable Duel** The characters convince Mudlump to participate in an honorable duel against one of their own. If Mudlump wins, he gets Pollenella; if he loses, he lets Amidor keep Pollenella and doesn't trouble the party again.
- **Magical Deception** The characters use magic to fool or placate Mudlump. For example, a character might create an illusion of Pollenella that fools the cyclops long enough for the party to escape. Alternatively, a character might use a *speak with animals* spell to find out what Pollenella wants. The bee would rather stay with Amidor than return to the cyclops; if Mudlump sees the spell being cast and learns of Pollenella's preference, he lets Amidor keep the bee.
- **Explain Love to Mudlump** The characters tell Mudlump that Amidor and Pollenella are in love. This statement causes the cyclops to blink in confusion and ask, "What is love?" If the concept is explained to him, Mudlump declares that he'd like to be in love, too, and gives the characters a quest to find his true love. Although the characters can try to pair Mudlump up with any creature they deem suitable, his ideal match can be found in the Palace of Heart's Desire: the fomorian Dubhforgail (see area P18 in *chapter 5*).

***Mudlump's Home.*** If Mudlump survives this encounter, he returns to his home in the tumbledown, moss-covered ruins of a 30-foot-diameter stone tower that once protruded from a mountainside. There, in a small garden, the cyclops has cultivated three fat, 6-foot-tall mushrooms. These fungi have been hollowed out and turned into casks, their caps serving as lids. These casks are used to ferment a mixture of water and honey, which Mudlump combines with other ingredients to make honey mead. A great beehive—considerably larger than the one Mudlump carries around—fills an ancient, rotted-out tree stump on one side of the tower. The stump is 10 feet tall, twice as wide, and has openings at the top through which Mudlump can reach into the hive. A 6-foot-high, 3-foot-wide, naturally formed opening on one side of the stump leads to a cavity filled with honeycombs and swarming with bees. (Amidor used this opening to enter the hive and rescue Pollenella.)

***Treasure.*** Mudlump has hidden the following treasures under loose stones throughout his home. Any character can find these items with a thorough search of the ruins:

- An empty crystal vial shaped like a pixie, dangling on the end of a delicate silver chain (75 gp)
- An untuned lyre of exquisite quality (250 gp)
- A *quiver of Ehlonna*

#### Evil Kite
Feenia, an unhappy goblin child (neutral) in overalls, flies a kite on a blustery plateau. The kite is alive, has a hideous face stretched over its diamond-shaped frame, and cackles in the wind. The kite's 40-foot-long string has five blue bows tied along its length at 8-foot intervals, starting about 5 feet from Feenia's end of the string and ending 5 feet away from the kite.

Feenia's goblin parents, Specklenose and Zolt, live and work in Motherhorn. Three days ago, Feenia was caught stealing theater props, but **Endelyn Moongrave** promised not to punish her as long as Feenia agreed to fly the hag's kite. Feenia did so and is now unable to let go of the cursed thing. Yanking the string from Feenia's grasp releases the goblin child from the pact but also ages her 10 years for every bow that is attached to the kite. The most she can age is 50 years—enough to transform her into a crone with skin like a shriveled apple.

Feenia speaks Common and Goblin. If the characters approach her, she shares the following information while the kite taunts her from above:

>>"My arms are so very sore, I don't want to fly this kite anymore! But if I let go of this string, Creeping Lyn says I'll become an old thing! The curse comes from those five blue bows, but they won't come off while the wind blows."
>>

The kite, which was created and brought to life by Endelyn, is a Small animated object (see the *animate objects* spell for its statistics). The bows can't be removed from the string while the kite is in the air, and the string can't be cut. The kite, its string, and the bows turn to ashes if the kite is reduced to 0 hit points.

The safest way to free Feenia from the kite without aging her is to untie the bows, which can be accomplished only while the kite is on the ground (see "The Kite Falls" below). Once the kite falls to the ground, it takes an action to untie each bow. Another way to free Feenia is to reduce the kite to 0 hit points with a single attack or effect before it can react (see "The Kite Reacts" below).

***The Kite Falls.*** A character who doesn't know what else to do can use an action to make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful check, the character senses a correlation between Feenia's foul mood and the strength of the wind around her. If the kite's taunts are muted for at least 1 minute using a *silence* spell or similar magic, Feenia's mood improves, causing the wind to abate and the kite to fall. The same thing happens if a character uses an action to try to calm Feenia, doing so with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, or if the goblin receives the benefit of a *calm emotions* spell or similar magic.

***The Kite Reacts.*** If the kite takes damage, but not enough to reduce it to 0 hit points, it uses its reaction to yank the string from Feenia's grasp (causing Feenia to age as described above). On subsequent turns, the untethered kite flies away.

***Development.*** Regardless of how this encounter plays out, Feenia is not happy about returning to Motherhorn as long as Creeping Lyn is there. She is aware of a small cave nearby where she can hide, and she can survive there indefinitely by eating moss and lizards.

Feenia has a trinket hidden in the pocket of her overalls. She gives this trinket to the characters if they rid her of the kite without causing her to age. Roll on the Feywild Trinkets table in the introduction to determine the trinket.

#### Goblin Procession
Eight **goblins** (neutral) shuffle into view, solemnly ringing handbells. They wear headdresses made from animal skulls (badgers, wolves, and rams) and are further adorned with necklaces of dangling bones. Known as the Dead Ringers, they sound their bells to comfort the dead, whom they believe lie in the rock beneath their feet.

The goblins are interested in talking to strangers and are willing to trade their services for a trinket. They have the power to commune with the dead by forming a circle and ringing their bells. (A minimum of three goblins are needed to perform the ritual.) After 1 minute of this clamor, the ephemeral spirit of a **korred** (see *appendix C*) or some other departed Fey creature rises from the ground between the goblins. The spirit answers three questions put to it, as though it was targeted by a *speak with dead* spell. Use the spirit to communicate as much useful information as you want; ideally, the characters should learn at least one fact that might help them in a future encounter.

The goblins require one trinket as payment each time they commune with a spirit. After performing this ritual three times, the goblins must finish a long rest to regain their spirit-summoning power.

#### Goblin Shadows
**Endelyn Moongrave** separates Humanoids from their shadows using a pair of magic scissors. These severed shadows, indebted to the hag for granting them their freedom, have become a minor menace to travelers.

Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher observe two silent shadows creeping up behind them. Each one looks like the slightly **elongated shadow** of a goblin; both use the **shadow** stat block, except they are Fey rather than Undead. The shadows can't leave Yon but otherwise try to follow the characters wherever they go, making spooky and threatening gestures but without causing any harm. If they are attacked, the shadows attack in turn. If one shadow is destroyed, the other tries to flee.

A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 by a shadow's Strength Drain attack does not die but falls unconscious instead. The creature regains consciousness and the reduction to its Strength score disappears after it finishes a short or long rest.

#### Pageant Wagon
A wooden pageant wagon trundles toward the party on squeaky wheels. It moves by itself at a speed of 20 feet and is accompanied by a tall figure swathed in long robes and a cowl. The wagon is painted with stormy, windswept landscapes and carries a puppet theater with black velvet curtains drawn across it.

The wagon stops near the characters, and the curtains pull back to reveal a painted backdrop that matches the environment in which the characters stand. Marionettes representing each of the characters dance on the stage and begin to reenact a recent scene from the party's time in Yon.

The marionettes, the wagon, and its attendant are magically animated. If the characters touch the hooded figure, it collapses into a pile of robes. If they try to board the wagon, it falls apart into a heap of wood scraps as thunder booms and lightning flashes overhead.

The play is 3 minutes long and ends with a scene that shows the characters standing around a tiny replica of the pageant wagon. A banner emblazoned with the words "To be continued!" unfurls in front of the scene, and then the curtains close. From the folds of its robes, the hooded figure presents a document to each character. Each one looks like a ticket with a tiny puppet resembling the character painted on it. Written under this effigy in script that the recipient understands (regardless of what languages it knows) are these words: "Good for one private audience with **Endelyn Moongrave**—no strings attached!" After the invitations are handed out, the wagon and its attendant disappear abruptly.

#### Tornado
The sky darkens as a huge tornado forms and careens toward the characters. Everyone in the party (characters and nonplayer characters) must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. If at least half of the party members succeed on the saving throw, none of them are swept away by the tornado.

If less than half of them succeed on the saving throw, the tornado whisks the group to a location determined by rolling on the Tornado Destinations table. Each party member takes 10 (3d6) force damage and falls prone upon landing. In addition, any character whose saving throw failed by 5 or more loses one nonmagical item in transit (determined by you). The item should be something that could reasonably be snatched away by the wind, such as a belt pouch or a helmet. This item is not recoverable.

##### Tornado Destinations
| d8 | Destination |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Somewhere in *Hither* (DM's choice) |
| 2 | Somewhere in *Thither* (DM's choice) |
| 3 | Outside Brigganock Mine (see "Brigganock Mine" later in the chapter) |
| 4 | Inside Lockbury Henge (see "Lockbury Henge" later in the chapter) |
| 5 | Atop one of the Fey Beacons (see "Fey Beacons" later in the chapter) |
| 6 | Outside Motherhorn's main entrance (area M1) |
| 7 | On the stage in Motherhorn's amphitheater (area M2) |
| 8 | In the garden of the Palace of Heart's Desire (see area P2 in *chapter 5*) |

## Locations in Yon
The following encounters take place at locations marked on the map of Yon. As the characters explore Yon, you can move these locations as needed, putting them in the characters' path. These locations can be explored in any order, or not at all:

Lockbury Henge. This henge sits atop a rocky plateau. The characters might come here hoping to forge an alliance with the korreds of Yon.

Fey Beacons. An elf prince named **Alagarthas** is doomed to light fires atop these pinnacles of rock until he finds a way back home. The characters can help him or not.

Brigganock Mine. The korreds of Yon are at loggerheads with the brigganocks who inhabit this mine. The characters might visit the mine in the hope of uniting the brigganocks and the korreds, or in search of a hero willing to help them. Inside the mine, they encounter a member of Valor's Call (see appendix B) and discover a secret way into *Motherhorn*.

### Lockbury Henge
Yon is home to eight clans of **korreds**. Queen Argantle, elected to rule over all eight clans, protects this sacred site. Lockbury Henge is meant to be a place where korreds can enjoy each other's company while singing, dancing, and playing games.

Argantle is playing a chess-like game called Crowns with her cousin, Jagu, when a howling wind warns her of the party's approach, giving her and Jagu enough time to stamp out the flame of their campfire and make themselves scarce before the characters arrive.

>>Atop a boulder-strewn plateau stands a circle of eight megaliths. In the center of this henge, a small, checkered game board with stone playing pieces rests on the ground near the dying embers of a campfire.
>>

Each of the eight standing stones is about 20 feet tall and hewn from a different kind of rock: shale, chalk, flint, granite, slate, basalt, obsidian, and marble. Two **korreds** (see *appendix C*) are using *meld into stone* spells to hide in two of the megaliths: Argantle of Shale in the one made of shale, and Jagu of Chalk (leader of the Chalk Clan korreds) in the one made of chalk. While hidden in this way, the korreds can see their surroundings as though the standing stones were transparent instead of opaque. Characters who examine the campfire and succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check notice two sets of small, sooty hoofprints leading up to the stones where the korreds are hiding.

> ##### Brigganocks and Korreds
>The **brigganocks** who live under the mountains of Yon are at odds with the **korreds** who live on the slopes and peaks. Each group believes that the other is in league with **Endelyn Moongrave**, not realizing that the hag is a menace to both. The characters encounter the korreds at Lockbury Henge and the brigganocks at Brigganock Mine. For more information about these Fey creatures, see *appendix C*.
>
>If the characters discover that the brigganocks are not allied with Endelyn and convey this information to the korreds, Queen Argantle of the korreds promptly arranges a meeting with the brigganocks to sort out their differences. Similarly, if the characters convince the brigganocks that the korreds don't work for Endelyn, the brigganocks agree to meet the korreds outside the mine. After this meeting, the korreds and the brigganocks unite to aid the characters in Motherhorn (as described in the "Fey to the Rescue!" sidebar later in the chapter).
>

Argantle and Jagu emerge from their megaliths if the characters properly finish the korreds' game of Crowns (see "Game Board" below). If the characters ruin the game, deface the standing stones, or otherwise irritate the korreds, Argantle and Jagu emerge from their megaliths and attack the characters for their insolence. Otherwise, the rule of hospitality (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*) prevents the korreds from harming the characters. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Argantle.

As an action, Argantle can call forth the remaining six leaders of the korred clans of Yon, each one emerging from its corresponding megalith. If combat breaks out, these six **korreds** help Argantle capture the characters for questioning. The other korred clan leaders are Budoc of Flint, Azil of Granite, Myzelda of Slate, Yanna of Basalt, Noll of Obsidian, and Malo of Marble.

The korreds of Yon despise **Endelyn Moongrave**, whom they commonly refer to as Bitter End. If the characters convince Argantle that they also consider the hag an enemy, she reveals the following:

- The korreds no longer hold large gatherings at Lockbury Henge. Argantle fears the consequences of Bitter End's meddling and has instructed her fellow korreds to ensconce themselves in stone, thus remaining in relative safety for the foreseeable future.
- Bitter End used iron shears to cut off locks of Argantle's hair. The hag fashions korred hair into iron ropes and uses them to manipulate her theater's infernal contraptions.
- Bitter End uses a contraption called the Orrery of Tragedies to glimpse all possible futures. Copper rods on the mountaintops of Yon capture lightning and channel it into this device.

#### Game Board
An examination of the checkered board reveals that the pieces depict a game in progress. Two sets of playing pieces, one made of shale and the other of chalk, are sculpted in the form of tiny korreds (cloven-hoofed creatures with wild beards and hair). If the characters have already visited Brigganock Mine, they see that the game pieces resemble the leering statues outside the mine's entrance.

Characters who study the arrangement of the pieces on the board and succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (Insight) check determine that Slate can beat Chalk in a single move. Making this move causes the victorious Queen Argantle to emerge from her stone, laughing and cheering. Jagu emerges grumpily to join her, chewing on pebbles and glaring at the characters.

***Treasure.*** The character who helped Argantle win the game receives a gift, in accordance with the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*). Argantle picks up a lump of rock, squeezes it tightly between her hands to transform it into a *star sapphire* (1,000 gp), and gives it to the character. If the gift is accepted, the gemstone begins to glow faintly. Until it stops glowing 24 hours later, the star sapphire has the properties of a *stone of good luck* that doesn't require attunement.

#### Distant Racket
Any conversation between the characters and the korreds is interrupted by a commotion:

>>The korreds grind their teeth and stamp their hooves as the faint sound of pickaxes tapping on stone is carried to them on the wind. Queen Argantle runs to a boulder, picks it up, and hurls it a hundred feet in the direction of the noise while she screams, "Death to the brigganocks!" A peal of thunder accompanies this display of anger.
>>

The korreds, who are feuding with the brigganocks of Yon, share the following information with characters who look like they might be capable of assisting:

- The brigganocks are helping Bitter End build wicked contraptions. They also hide and guard schematic diagrams for new contraptions in their mine. (The korreds are mistaken. The hag terrorizes the brigganocks and has kidnapped their chief architect, forcing him to work under duress in *Motherhorn*.)
- The korreds can't stand the noise of the brigganocks' mining, so they craft statues and leave them outside the mine's entrance, hoping to frighten the brigganocks into leaving.
- A galeb duhr working for the korreds infiltrated the mine and overheard several brigganocks talking about a secret tunnel that connects the mine to Motherhorn. The tunnel is hidden by brigganock magic.

#### Korred Dance
The noise of the mining soon passes. If the korreds are well disposed toward the characters, Queen Argantle becomes elated at the prospect of their assistance, drums her hooves on the ground, and begins the first korred ceremonial dance since the rise of the Hourglass Coven. If she hasn't done so already, Argantle summons the other korred leaders so they can join in:

>>Two korreds drum on boulders as the others stomp their feet and jump around. The rain abates, and the sky lightens. With wild grins and wilder hair, the dancing korreds beckon you to join them.
>>

Any character who joins the boisterous dance can impress the korreds with a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Charisma (Performance) check. Characters who get a success on either check are taught a special jig which, when performed as an action, allows them to manipulate any korred hair they find in Motherhorn as if using the korreds' Command Hair trait.

#### Development
The accompanying "Brigganocks and Korreds" sidebar describes how the characters can facilitate a truce between the two groups of Fey and unite them against **Endelyn Moongrave**.

![[076-04-004.dance-of-the-korreds.png|right|300]]

### Fey Beacons
In this encounter, a cursed prince trying to find his way home is thwarted by a troupe of perytons. If they want, the characters can intervene on the prince's behalf, or they can simply take in the sights and move on:

>>Eight columns of rock reach skyward, forming a ring around a deep crater lake. Rough-hewn steps spiral up each of the columns, and a rowboat is moored on the lakeshore next to one of them. A torch-bearing figure trudges up the stairs on the column nearest to the rowboat. Eight winged beasts with antlers shout and howl with laughter as they circle and wheel around it.
>>

The columns of rock are 200 feet tall and 150 feet apart. Each one has a large copper brazier at its summit. These braziers aren't visible from below the columns' summits, but all eight can be seen from the top of any column or by a creature flying at that elevation or higher. The lake is 400 feet in diameter and 100 feet deep at its center.

The figure is **Alagarthas**, a wood elf prince from the Material Plane. As the characters watch from afar, he reaches the top of the column he is ascending and uses his torch to light the beacon there. The beacon burns bright as he descends the stairs and boards the rowboat. As the elf rows toward the next beacon, the eight **perytons** that had been harassing him extinguish the flame in the brazier with powerful beats of their wings. **Alagarthas** believes the fiery beacons can show him the way home, but only while all of them are lit.

![[077-04-005.greyhawk-mummers.png|right|300]]

#### Prince Alagarthas
After several failed attempts to fend off a green dragon threatening the prosperity of his kingdom, **Alagarthas** caught the eye of **Endelyn Moongrave**, who visited him on his home world of Toril. The hag showed the prince a future in which he defeated the dragon but lost his life in the process. Endelyn also claimed to see an alternate future in which the dragon was defeated and **Alagarthas** survived; she would share the details of her vision with **Alagarthas**, however, only after he stayed with her in the Feywild for at least one year.

The prince saw a year of his life as a small price to pay, so he accepted the hag's terms. The year seemed to drag on and on, and when it finally ended, **Alagarthas** found himself with only one way to get home: a path that, according to Endelyn, is visible "only in the light of the eight beacons." The simple goal of lighting the beacons has been repeatedly thwarted by the perytons, who revel in **Alagarthas**'s despair. Each time he lights a beacon, the perytons snuff it out, yet **Alagarthas** is too stubborn and determined to give up. He hopes the perytons will grow bored of their antics and leave him alone eventually. He is, however, misguided in that expectation.

**Alagarthas** is a **knight** (chaotic good) with these changes:

- **Alagarthas** is unarmed and unarmored (AC 10).
- He speaks Common and Elvish, and he has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- He has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.

If the characters speak with **Alagarthas**, he tells his tragic story and shares the following information in the course of a conversation:

- Endelyn's castle is a grand and terrible theater where plays are performed on the stage for her amusement.
- Endelyn is always trying to recruit new actors to perform in her theater.
- The perytons were once a troupe of actors called the Greyhawk Mummers. Endelyn invited them to Motherhorn, where they performed pantomimes. (**Alagarthas** attended several of these performances.) When their popularity made them haughty and difficult to control, Endelyn locked them up. When they begged to be set free, the hag honored their request by releasing them into the wild—but only after she turned them into perytons. The transformation deprived them of speech, yet they retain their theatrical behavior.

*Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for **Alagarthas**.

#### Performing Perytons
As **Alagarthas** related, the perytons used to be human pantomimists known as the Greyhawk Mummers—so named because they got their start performing in the Free City of Greyhawk on the world of Oerth. The perytons remember their former lives as actors, and though they understand Common and Elvish, they can no longer speak.

Archillus and Mortia are the leading male and leading female of the troupe. The others are Verna (Mortia's bitter understudy), Mauldower (an old-timer who believes his cohorts are amateurs), Angara (the troupe's matriarchal dame), Gorgenal (a jester), Carthasar (a method actor), and Thornelia (a minstrel).

The characters can help **Alagarthas** without resorting to violence by asking the perytons to perform one of their favorite pantomimes. The perytons are taken aback, in a good way, by the request and appreciate the opportunity to entertain a crowd. They perform a pantomime show that lasts nearly an hour, then take their bows silently. If everyone in the party claps or cheers, the perytons are thrilled and fly off. If one or more party members fail to clap or cheer after the perytons perform, the perytons become furious and attack the party. Once the perytons are placated or slain, **Alagarthas** can light the beacons without further interference.

The characters can also impress the perytons by putting on a performance of their own. Impressing the perytons requires the performing characters to succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) group check. Any character who received an acting lesson from Candlefoot in the Witchlight Carnival has advantage on this check. If the group check succeeds, the perytons regard the characters as kindred spirits and will stop bothering **Alagarthas** if the characters ask nicely.

***Unicorn Horn.*** If the *Story Tracker* indicates that the unicorn horn is here, it is in the possession of the peryton named Archillus. **Skabatha Nightshade** dropped it accidentally while flying over the mountains, and Archillus found it and kept it. He gives it to the characters if they applaud his performance or if they put on a successful performance of their own. They can also take the horn from his dead body.

#### Lighting the Beacons
If the perytons are placated or otherwise dealt with, **Alagarthas** can safely light the beacons. **Alagarthas** knows that he must be the one to light the beacons, for only then will they show him the way home. The characters are free to stay and watch as he climbs to the top of each rocky column and lights its beacon. It takes 8 hours for him to light all eight beacons—enough time for the characters to take a long rest if they choose to stick around.

Each beacon consists of an 8-foot-diameter stone brazier filled with coals that catch fire easily, even while wet. To light a brazier, one need only touch the coals with the head of a lit torch or some other open flame. If **Alagarthas** is allowed to light all eight beacons by himself, read:

>>Beneath the light of all the beacons, you see reflected in the mirror-like surface of the lake a forest of ancient trees shrouded in mist. **Alagarthas** bows to you, then leaps into the lake. As he plunges into the water, ripples fan out across its surface. After a minute, the forest scene fades away and the beacons go out one by one.
>>

**Alagarthas** is transported safely back to his home in the Misty Forest on the world of Toril, as is any other creature that enters the water before the scene fades away.

Any character who lights all eight beacons without assistance causes the lake to display an image of whatever place that character calls home. The image lasts for 1 minute, and any creature that enters the water during that time is transported to this destination. There's no way to get back to the lake, making it a one-way trip.

### Brigganock Mine
Whenever a mortal makes a wish on the Material Plane, an echo of that wish crystallizes inside a stone buried deep in the earth of the Feywild. Tiny creatures called **brigganocks** excavate mines beneath the surface of Yon to search for these wish stones. A secret route to Motherhorn lies hidden deep inside the mine; the brigganocks reveal it only to those who earn their respect.

Read the following boxed text aloud when the characters first approach the mine's entrance:

>>You hear the sound of hundreds of tiny pickaxes and hammers chipping away at stone. It emanates from the mouth of a cave that has fingers of rock reaching skyward above it. Statues of irate, hairy creatures with cloven hooves are positioned so that they lean around trees and peer over boulders, all staring balefully at the cave entrance.
>>

The statues depict korreds and are harmless. They were carved and placed here by real korreds to frighten and intimidate the brigganocks (see "Lockbury Henge" earlier in the chapter).

#### Entering the Mine
If one or more characters enter the mine, read:

>>As soon as you step inside the cave, the tapping noise stops.
>>

As the characters head deeper into the mine, the sound of hammering resumes, coming up from the depths.

#### Exploring the Mine
The mine is a twisting labyrinth of 8-foot-high, 3-foot-wide tunnels that corkscrew into the ground. The brigganocks made these tunnels big enough to accommodate ponies (which they use as beasts of burden) and their good friend **Molliver**, whom the characters will encounter if they head deeper into the mine (see "**Molliver**" below).

The characters encounter no brigganocks in the upper reaches of the mine, but the sound of activity persists. After 10 minutes of navigating the mine, each character must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or fall asleep for 1 hour, lulled into a magical slumber by the rhythmic racket of the miners. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this effect permanently. Elves and other creatures that can't be put to sleep by magic are also immune to the effect. Creatures that are put to sleep in this way can't be awakened early by any means short of a *wish* spell.

Eight **brigganocks** (see *appendix C*) arrive 5 minutes later, each one pushing a tiny wheelbarrow that contains ropes and pitons. If they encounter party members who are still awake, the brigganocks look surprised, turn their wheelbarrows around, and retreat whence they came, passing **Molliver** as they return to the mine's depths (see "**Molliver**" below). Otherwise, if there's no one around to stop them, they use their Time Lapse action to rapidly pin sleeping party members to the floor using their hammers, pitons, and ropes.

Creatures pinned to the floor are restrained, prone, and unable to stand up until they free themselves or are released by someone else. A creature can use an action to try to snap the ropes that bind it or to wriggle free of them, doing so with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check or DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If a creature has a knife or other sharp tool that it can reach while pinned to the floor, it can use an action to try to saw through its ropes, doing so with a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. A creature that gets free can use an action to release a creature that is still pinned (no ability check required).

> ##### Wish-Come-True
>The brigganocks hail from a city called Wish-come-true, which is hidden deep beneath the mountains. Its buildings are adorned with glittering gems made from cut wish stones. Hidden behind thick rock walls and powerful illusions, the city can never be found by outsiders, nor can it be scried upon using divination magic.
>

#### Molliver
If the entire party is pinned to the floor by the brigganocks, the characters awaken to find themselves staring up at a human standing in their midst. Otherwise, they encounter this individual if they chase after any fleeing brigganocks or head deeper into the mine:

>>A tall, slender human clad in dark leather armor greets you, their friendly face brightly illuminated by a tiny wisp of light that floats next to a mouse-sized creature perched on the human's shoulder.
>>
>>"Greetings, trespassers," says the human with a smile. "Didn't anyone ever teach you how to knock?"
>>

The armored figure is **Molliver** (see appendix B), and the creature on **Molliver**'s shoulder is Trig, a **brigganock** (see *appendix C*). Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher notice two more **brigganocks** hiding on **Molliver**'s person—one tucked comfortably in a belt pouch and the other peering over the rim of **Molliver**'s left boot. Their names are Zarli and Oyla.

The brigganocks are happy to have **Molliver** as their spokesperson and chief advisor when it comes to dealing with outsiders. **Molliver** has become embroiled in the brigganocks' quarrel with the korreds and assumes—as the brigganocks do—that the characters were sent by the korreds or their evil ally, Creeping Lyn, to slay brigganocks and steal wish stones.

The characters can convince **Molliver** of their true intentions with a successful DC 9 Charisma (Persuasion) check, or they can trick **Molliver** into letting them venture deeper into the mines with a successful DC 9 Charisma (Deception) check. Once convinced that the characters are opposed to Creeping Lyn and not conspiring with the korreds, **Molliver** instructs the brigganocks to release any character who is still pinned to the floor and shares the following information with conscious characters:

- Creeping Lyn kidnapped the brigganocks' best architect, Golmo, who now toils in Motherhorn, designing new contraptions for the hag.
- The korreds provide Creeping Lyn with locks of their magic hair, which she uses to build her contraptions. (This is partially false. The hag cuts the korreds' hair without their consent; they are not her allies.)
- The brigganocks work their mine at all hours because they know the noise aggravates the korreds.

**Molliver** dodges questions about how they came to be with the brigganocks but admits to being a member of Valor's Call, an adventuring group that has been hunting a pack of villains called the League of Malevolence. **Molliver** assumes that the other members of Valor's Call are safe at Zybilna's palace and is unaware of all that has happened there of late (see *chapter 5*). Knowing that their friends are in trouble doesn't change **Molliver**'s desire to remain with the brigganocks, who need protection.

#### Rivenwish Chasm
After conferring with Trig, **Molliver** says that if the characters complete a test set before them, the brigganocks will show them a secret route to Motherhorn. To pass the test, the characters must cross Rivenwish Chasm, a gash in the earth into which the brigganocks hurl malignant wish stones (the ones born out of evil wishes). **Molliver** and their brigganock companions lead the characters through several tunnels that lead to the chasm but stop short of entering it:

>>The route ends at a gaping chasm, on the far side of which is a grotto full of stalactites and stalagmites. A truss bridge constructed of intricate wooden struts and beams spans the one-hundred-foot gap across the chasm. Beneath the bridge is darkness dotted with purple lights.
>>
>>"Well," declares **Molliver**, "here we are at jolly old Rivenwish Chasm. Best stay on the bridge and not dillydally."
>>

The bridge is 5 feet wide, 100 feet long, and sturdy. Each 5-foot section of the wooden structure has AC 15, 30 hit points, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage.

The chasm is haunted by three **flameskulls**—the remains of darklings who suffered from vertigo and fell to their doom before reaching the bridge's halfway point. The flameskulls hide under the bridge's midpoint. Characters who have passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of 10 or higher aren't surprised when the flameskulls emerge from hiding and take up positions 10 feet above the bridge.

The flameskulls speak Elvish and Sylvan. Their names are Weaugh, Teaugh, and Peaugh. The flameskulls are hostile toward all other creatures in the chasm and attack without provocation. They become indifferent toward any creature that walks or runs across the bridge and makes it past the midpoint (regardless of the direction it is traveling). Weaugh, Teaugh, and Peaugh congratulate the creature on making it this far.

A character toward whom the flameskulls are indifferent can use an action to try to convince the flameskulls to let the party pass, doing so with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the flameskulls are persuaded to allow safe passage, they apologize for their unprovoked hostility before returning to their hiding spots under the bridge. From that point on, all characters in the party can cross the chasm safely in either direction.

There's no chance of a character accidentally falling off the bridge or being knocked off the bridge by the flameskulls. The chasm is 200 feet deep, and its bottom is strewn with hundreds of malignant wish stones that give off purple light. These wish stones are unrefined lumps of crystal that shed bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet; any good-aligned creature that has one or more of them in its possession feels mildly nauseated, although this nausea has no game effect. Hags, liches, and other evil spellcasters can find macabre uses for these malignant wish stones, which otherwise have no value.

#### Obud's Grotto
When the characters reach the subterranean grotto on the far side of the bridge, read:

>>In the center of the grotto is a piebald pony wearing blinders. A small wooden hut is strapped to its back, and a faint clatter can be heard from inside the hut.
>>

**Molliver** and their brigganock companions explain to the characters that the hut is the home of Obud, the oldest **brigganock** (see *appendix C*) living in the mine at present. Securely fastened to a **pony** named Keg is Obud's hut, where he appraises gemstones brought to him by other brigganocks. When Obud wants to dismount from the pony, he lowers a rope ladder attached to one of the pony's saddle straps.

The pony doesn't startle easily and allows characters to approach it without a fuss, and it eagerly devours any apples and carrots that the characters have to offer. If someone knocks on the hut's tiny door, read:

>>The door swings open, and a tiny, wrinkled creature hobbles into view, accompanied by a wispy bulb of light. The old brigganock peers at you through tiny spectacles and says in Common, "Big folk. How wonderful."
>>

Obud is old and tired, but neither too old nor too tired to show the characters hospitality. He welcomes them to his grotto, introduces them to Keg, and asks them why they've crossed the chasm to see him. If they inquire about the secret tunnel to Motherhorn, he says, "Ah, yes. Creeping Lyn's Theater of Terror. A dreadful place indeed." Obud suggests a trade: knowledge of the location of the tunnel in exchange for something that would benefit him and his fellow brigganocks. Ending the quarrel between the brigganocks and the korreds would suffice (see the "Brigganocks and Korreds" sidebar earlier in the chapter). Obud also accepts tasty food, including but not limited to sweets, a wheel of cheese, or a head of lettuce. Candy from the Witchlight Carnival or the goblin market in Loomlurch would suffice.

***Treasure.*** Brigganocks shape and cut good wish stones into sparkling gems. Obud has three such gems in his hut, neatly laid out on a tiny rug. Two of the gems are worth 100 gp, and the third is worth 500 gp. Obud has appraised the gemstones and is waiting for their rightful brigganock owners to return and collect them. Stealing these gems violates the rule of ownership (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*). Characters who steal from Obud receive no further help from him.

![[079-04-007.pony.png|right|300]]

#### Tunnel to Motherhorn
A permanent illusion of a rock wall conceals an 8-foot-high, 3-foot-wide tunnel in the back wall of Obud's grotto. This secret tunnel leads to a storage room (area M12) beneath Motherhorn's stage. The illusory wall has no substance, which means that creatures and objects can pass right through it. A successful casting of *dispel magic* (DC 19) causes the illusory wall to disappear.

Obud informs the characters that Creeping Lyn is unaware of this tunnel's existence ("Let's keep it that way, aye?" he adds). The characters can return to the grotto through the tunnel whenever they want, provided they are on good terms with the brigganocks. If the characters use the tunnel without Obud's consent, brigganock miners spend the next 8 hours collapsing the tunnel on itself, preventing the characters from returning to the mine by that route.

#### Wish Stones
Check the *Story Tracker* to see if any of the characters made wishes while with Northwind (see "Hour 1: Welcome Gifts" in *chapter 1*). If so, echoes of their wishes have crystallized in the depths of Yon and were mined by the brigganocks. As the characters are preparing to leave the mine, a cheerful brigganock named Ajak arrives with a wheelbarrow containing the characters' wish stones. These stones look like round lumps of crystal and have not yet been shaped or cut. If a character's wish was good-natured, its stone glows with golden light (bright light out to a range of 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet). If the wish was evil-natured, its stone glows with purple light (bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet).

Characters whose wishes were good-hearted can keep their stones as mementos or leave the stones with the brigganocks to be cut into sparkling gemstones—a process that takes 8 hours with the help of the brigganocks' Time Lapse action. (The characters can return to the mine to collect their gems after attending to other matters.) A fairly common wish produces a 50 gp gemstone, an unusual wish produces a 100 gp gemstone, and an exceptionally original wish produces a 500 gp gemstone (as determined by you). Once a wish stone is cut into a gem, it loses its magic and ceases to glow.

The brigganocks don't make gemstones out of malignant wish stones. Instead, they toss these purple-glowing stones into Rivenwish Chasm unless the characters who created them want to take the stones with them. Mild nausea plagues any good-aligned creature that has one or more of these stones in its possession, though this nausea has no game effect.

#### Development
The "Brigganocks and Korreds" sidebar earlier in the chapter describes how the characters can facilitate a truce between the two groups of Fey and unite them against **Endelyn Moongrave**. If the korreds and brigganocks end their quarrel and launch an assault on *Motherhorn*, **Molliver** accompanies the combined force.

## Motherhorn
Motherhorn is Yon's tallest peak, into which Endelyn has carved an amphitheater of the same name. Macabre moldings, friezes, and gargoyles embellish the amphitheater's grim architecture.

Recurring features include the following elements:

- **Ceilings** Unless otherwise noted, ceilings throughout Motherhorn are 15 feet high. The amphitheater is open to the sky, as are the various stone balconies.
- **Curtains** The curtains that hang across doorways are made of black fabric, and each curtain has been enchanted so that sound doesn't pass through it while it is closed.
- **Doors** With the exception of the stone doors that block the main entrance (area M1) and the prison (area M17), all doors in Motherhorn are made of sturdy wood with iron handles and fittings. Each one has a bronze knocker on one side shaped like a smiling theater mask; a similar knocker on the opposite side is shaped like a frowning theater mask. None of these doors have locks.
- **Light** Glowing orbs of red glass are set into wrought-iron wall sconces throughout Motherhorn. Each orb sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Removing an orb from its sconce causes the orb's light to go dark until it is returned to a sconce.

## Entering Motherhorn
The characters can get into Motherhorn in one of several ways:

- They can use the front door (area M1).
- They can use climbing gear or magic to scale the walls. Doing so allows them to enter the amphitheater (area M2) or reach one of the higher balconies (areas M15, M16, M20, and M21).
- A magical tornado (see "Random Encounters in Yon" earlier in this chapter) might deposit them in the amphitheater.
- They can use the secret tunnel dug by the brigganocks (area M12).

Characters who obtained invitations from a pageant wagon (see "Random Encounters in Yon" earlier in the chapter) are entitled to a free audience with Endelyn. Any member of the theater staff can accept the characters' invitations and escort them safely to the hag's audience chamber (area M18).

If one or more characters claim to be performers looking for work at the theater, they are granted an audition, during which they will be required to perform a play for Endelyn's pleasure (see "A Tragedy in the Making" later in the chapter for details).

## Approaching Motherhorn
Characters who use the brigganocks' secret tunnel to reach Motherhorn arrive at area M12.

If the characters instead approach Motherhorn using an aboveground route, use the following boxed text to describe what they see:

>>Looming above you is an ominous gray citadel hewn out of the mountaintop. The path leading to it is winding and precipitous. Wind swirls around its towers, and ravens cluster and caw in its granite nooks. A crooked finger of lightning strikes a metal rod protruding from the topmost spire, and the sound of applause drifts over the citadel's battlements.
>>
>>The mountain path ends at a spiral staircase that climbs sixty feet to a balcony made of weathered gray stone.
>>

If Trinket, Bauble, and Charm left Hither and returned to Motherhorn in their rain cloud balloon (see *chapter 2*), it is tethered to a balcony (area M16) and visible to all who approach. Describe the balloon as follows:

>>A large balloon made of bulging rain clouds is tethered to a much higher stone balcony that is well beyond reach. The balloon has a merchant's stall instead of an ordinary basket dangling from it.
>>

If Gleam is with the characters, she warns them that **Endelyn Moongrave** won't be happy to see her again. If the characters tell her to remain outside while they rescue her sibling, Gleam does so grudgingly. Amidor and Pollenella remain by the elf's side for company.

If Gleam accompanies the characters into Motherhorn, she avoids combat while urging the characters to escort her to the prison (area M17), where her sister is being held. Gleam has spent enough time in Motherhorn to be familiar with the theater's layout, though she knows nothing about the secret brigganock tunnel that leads to area M12.

## Where's Endelyn?
When she's not granting audiences, Endelyn keeps to the following routine:

- Twice per day, Endelyn watches plays from one of the balconies (area M21). Occasionally, when the mood strikes her, she swoops down to the stage (area M2) on her *ornithopter of flying* (see *appendix A*) in the closing minutes of a play to steal the show.
- While plays are being rehearsed in the amphitheater, she spends her time in area M19, peering down at the Orrery of Tragedies in area M14 and using a quill pen to transcribe its prophecies into a tiny black book.
- During the eight hours when no plays are being rehearsed or performed, she sleeps standing up inside a glass-paneled wardrobe in area M22.

### Bargaining with Endelyn
When the characters come to Motherhorn, Endelyn has foreseen their arrival and is expecting them. If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook and the *Story Tracker* indicates that Endelyn has one or more things that the characters need, she is willing to trade away these possessions one by one, but only after the characters agree to perform on her stage.

Regardless of what the characters want from her, Endelyn typically requires them to perform for her before she will bargain with them. If she deems the characters' performance satisfactory (see "A Tragedy in the Making" below), she leads the party to her audience chamber (area M18) and conducts negotiations there. If the deems their performance unsatisfactory, she doesn't feel bound by the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*) to grant them an audience.

> ##### Fey to the Rescue!
>If the characters helped the korreds and brigganocks settle their differences earlier in the chapter, they offer to help the characters in return. Twelve **brigganocks** hanging from the beards of three **korreds** arrive on the outskirts of Motherhorn at an agreed-upon time, ready to spring into action if the characters call for aid (see *appendix C* for their stat blocks).
>
>If one or more characters cry out for assistance in Motherhorn, the brigganocks and korreds hear the call for help and react quickly. The korreds barrel out of the secret tunnel in area M12 or scale the theater's walls using ropes made of korred hair, and the brigganocks use their *darkness*, *faerie fire*, *silence*, and *sleep* spells to confound and neutralize Endelyn's minions. The Fey try not to steal the show; their goal is to distract Endelyn's minions so the characters can wriggle out of a tight spot or confront the hag without her lackeys.
>

If the characters decline to perform a play for her, Endelyn demands that they leave at once, ordering her **darklings** to attack characters who refuse to do so. In the ensuing fracas, characters who are reduced to 0 hit points are knocked unconscious, stripped of their gear, and locked in the prison (area M17) until Endelyn decides what to do with them. (Stagefright leads the way to the prison, since his fool's scepter is needed to open the prison's front door.) If Endelyn finds no other use for imprisoned characters, she turns them into masks using the arcane device in area M8.

Characters who come to Motherhorn bearing invitations from a pageant wagon (see "Random Encounters in Yon" earlier in the chapter) can skip the performance and jump straight to the private audience.

Assuming that the characters' performance or the presentation of their invitations puts Endelyn in a bargaining mood, she agrees to part with one creature or object in her possession, but only if the characters give her one of the following items in exchange:

- **Shadow** If a character agrees to give up their shadow, Endelyn uses her *scissors of shadow snipping* (see *appendix A*) to snip it off.
- **Gloam the Cat** Endelyn accuses her sister, **Bavlorna Blightstraw**, of stealing her cat, **Gloam**. Endelyn wants the characters to travel to Bavlorna's cottage in Downfall (see chapter 2), find her cat, and return it to her. (Endelyn doesn't know that Bavlorna killed and stuffed the cat, but she wants it back regardless of its condition.)
- **Unicorn Horn** Endelyn claims that her sister Skabatha recently lost a unicorn horn, and Endelyn wants the character to find the horn and bring it to her. (Refer to the *Story Tracker* for the unicorn horn's location, though any unicorn's horn will do.) Endelyn mentions in passing that the unicorn whose horn was lost is still alive, although transformed into a rocking horse that **Skabatha Nightshade** uses as a flying mount.

If Endelyn has more things in her possession that the characters want, she is willing to enter into a separate bargain for each one. Magic items fashioned from lost things are kept in area M22.

### Endelyn's Escape
Endelyn is loath to leave Motherhorn, but if her survival depends on it, she moves to area M21 and uses her *ornithopter of flying* to retreat to the Palace of Heart's Desire. Her sisters, if present, flee to the palace as well (Bavlorna on her lily pad and Skabatha on her rocking horse).

![[080-04-008.tiefling.png|right|300]]

## A Tragedy in the Making
Motherhorn's amphitheater is where tragic plays are performed daily for **Endelyn Moongrave** to enjoy. The characters might choose to perform on stage for one or more of the following reasons:

- In order to acquire something or someone in Endelyn's possession, the characters might need to perform a play to put the hag in a bargaining mood (see "Bargaining with Endelyn" above).
- The characters might intend to uphold a bargain made with **Skabatha Nightshade** (see "Bargaining with Skabatha" in *chapter 3*).
- The characters might want to create a distraction, and performing a play is the best way to keep Endelyn and her minions preoccupied.

While the play is going on, one or more characters might try to sneak off and explore other areas of Motherhorn on their own, splitting the party. If that occurs, resolve what happens to these wandering characters after the play has run its course.

### Preparing for the Play
Characters who choose to perform a play are met by Motherhorn's master of ceremonies, Stagefright, who is a **goblin boss** (chaotic neutral). Describe this meeting as follows:

>>A goblin in a jester's costume taps his clownish scepter on the floor to get your attention and says, "To impress the Dame of Unhappy Endings, you will need to perform a tragedy—something gruesome, depressing, and darkly humorous. I have just the play!" A rolled-up script suddenly appears in his hand. "Normally we would have several hours to prepare, but alas, time is of the essence. Since you don't have time to memorize all the lines, we'll need to improvise." Tossing the script over one shoulder, he says, "Worry not! I'll feed you lines from the wings if you get stuck!"
>>

Have each player roll once on the Performers' Roles table to determine what role Stagefright assigns to that player's character. If two players get the same result, Stagefright lets them decide which one of them takes that role before suggesting another role for the other character (choose a table entry that hasn't already been assigned). Allow characters to invent new roles for themselves if they don't like the ones they're assigned. If a character wants to play a talking pumpkin or a bored treant, let it happen!

##### Performers' Roles
| d8 | Role |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Drunken satyr |
| 2 | Failed magician |
| 3 | High-and-mighty princess |
| 4 | Mean-spirited servant |
| 5 | Nervous apothecary |
| 6 | Cowardly noble |
| 7 | Foolish minstrel |
| 8 | Honorable knight risen from the dead |

Once all the characters have roles, Stagefright leads them to a prop storeroom (area M4a) and says, "Find whatever you can make use of in this mess!" The characters are allowed 20 minutes to don costumes and select props appropriate for their assigned roles. When they're ready, Stagefright leads them through the dressing room (area M5) to the performers' quarters (area M6), whereupon he says, "The play begins in ten minutes!" Characters can spend that time doing whatever they want. When the 10 minutes are up, Stagefright reappears and escorts the party to the stage (area M2).

**Endelyn Moongrave** (see appendix B) peers down at the stage from a 40-foot-high stone balcony (area M21) while a gloomy audience of darklings watches from the amphitheater seats and masked goblins perch atop the stage rigging (see the boxed text in area M2 for details). Stagefright introduces the characters' troupe and their play, then ducks behind a curtain. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Stagefright.

### Performing the Play
*Appendix E* contains lines of dialogue for you to photocopy and cut out. Place the slips of paper in a paper bag or other opaque container, then give it to your players. At the start of the play, each player draws a slip of paper from the container, as Stagefright hisses a line to that player's character from the wings. The rules of the play are as follows:

- The players must ad-lib a tragedy. What their characters say and do is up to them for the most part, but they must find a way to incorporate Stagefright's lines into the play's dialogue. Each time a character delivers one of Stagefright's lines, that character's player draws a new line from the bag.
- Characters can freely move around the stage, use props, and enter and exit scenes as they wish, but every character who has a role must contribute to the performance.
- If one of the play's characters dies or meets some other tragic end, that character's player no longer draws lines of dialogue. A character who exits the story in this fashion can leave the stage but is expected to return and take a final bow once the play has concluded. Antics performed by offstage characters (including but not limited to the exploration of other areas in Motherhorn) should be resolved after the play concludes.

Endelyn is the play's sole judge. Use the *Story Tracker* to keep track of how well the performance is going, in Endelyn's estimation:

- Tally one success every time a handout line is delivered in a way that complements the narrative.
- Tally one success if a particularly gruesome, tragic, or darkly humorous scene is enacted.
- Tally one failure each time a character loiters in the wings or remains on stage for too long without speaking.
- Tally one failure if too much time goes by without a handout line being spoken, prompting Stagefright to rattle his fool's scepter at the performers. (If you have a one-minute egg timer, you can use it as a control. Every time a handout line is spoken, flip the egg timer. If the timer runs out, too much time has gone by, warranting one failure.)

### Endelyn's Verdict
When all the handout lines have been delivered or when all the play's characters have met tragic ends, Stagefright signals the characters to wrap it up and take their bows. Then he joins them on stage to await Endelyn's verdict.

***Success.*** If the characters earned more successes than failures, Endelyn is pleased to strike bargains with them. In addition, she invites them to stay in the theater as long as they like and make themselves at home; those who accept are assigned quarters in area M6.

***Failure.*** If the characters netted more failures than successes, Endelyn is not entertained by their play and won't bargain with them. She orders the characters to leave her theater at once; if one or more of them refuse, she orders the darklings in the audience to attack. Characters who are reduced to 0 hit points in the ensuing fracas are knocked unconscious, then stripped of their gear and locked in the prison (area M17) until Endelyn decides how to punish them for wasting her precious time.

## Motherhorn Locations
The following locations are keyed to the map of Motherhorn.

![[082-map-4.2-motherhorn-player.jpg|right|300]]
### M1. Main Entrance
Recessed into the inner wall of the balcony is a 12-foot-high, stone double door with fancy scrollwork along its edges but no visible handles, hinges, or seams. If someone touches the door, read:

>>The surface of the door assumes the likeness of a skull-faced hag. "The moon-twin is not welcome here," it says in a raspy voice. "All others may step forward and pass through the black curtain at the end of the entrance hall."
>>
>>The visage splits down the middle as the double door swings open, revealing a decorated hallway in which discordant chamber music plays.
>>

The visage can see and hear whatever's on the balcony, and it waits expectantly for creatures to pass through the open doorway. When no authorized creatures are left on the balcony in front of it, the door closes until its outer surface is touched again. Creatures that want to leave Motherhorn by this route need only touch the inside of the double door, which causes it to swing open; it remains open until 10 seconds pass without a creature passing through it. The door can't be opened otherwise—not by using magic, thieves' tools, or brute force.

If Gleam (the "moon-twin" mentioned by the door) tries to enter without having a convincing disguise, an invisible force pushes her back onto the balcony. Any disguise of a magical nature is sufficient to fool the door. A conventional disguise works as well, provided whoever created the disguise fools the door by succeeding on DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check. If she is unable to enter Motherhorn, Gleam waits outside for the characters and urges them to find her sister as quickly as possible. Amidor, Pollenella, and any other guides accompanying the party stay with Gleam, keeping her company while she waits.

***Entrance Hall.*** The discordant music that fills the hallway beyond the stone door is magical. At the north end of the corridor hangs a thick, black curtain. No sound passes through this curtain while it is closed.

### M2. Amphitheater

>>An open-air amphitheater is carved from the slope of the mountaintop. Short, cloaked figures sit on tiered stone benches, facing the stage. Enclosing the stage are ten-foot-high stone walls, above which you can see the stormy sky. A team of masked goblins is preparing the stage for a play while costumed actors huddle in the wings and recite lines. Lighting is provided by an intricate overhead contraption upon which several more masked goblins are perched. The sounds of chains clanking and gears turning can be heard coming from somewhere under the mountaintop.
>>

Plays and rehearsals take place here during the sixteen hours of every day when Endelyn is awake. A play is usually rehearsed for 6 hours and then performed for 2 hours. The first time the characters arrive here, a rehearsal is underway; roll on the Motherhorn Tragedies table to determine which play is being rehearsed.

##### Motherhorn Tragedies
| d8 | Summary |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A Tragedy at Twilight. A bright light appears in the evening sky during a royal wedding. The light grows bigger and causes lively discussion between the revelers. It turns out to be a comet that crashes into the wedding, killing everyone. |
| 2 | Lament of a Suckling Boar. A young boar with silvered tusks vows to slay the werewolf who murdered his parents. He carries his parents' remains (a string of sausages) around in a basket. |
| 3 | Only Fools Knock Twice. In this dark comedy, three sailors, shipwrecked in the ocean, cling to a coffin. |
| 4 | The Lich King's Revel. A lich king cannot decide which of his three living sons should rule his kingdom, so he throws a party during which his sons are grafted into a single flesh golem. |
| 5 | Love Unsoiled. A maiden, unable to find the perfect suitor, chooses a beau from beyond the grave, much to her father's consternation. |
| 6 | A Village No More. A long-brokered peace between a green dragon and a nearby village is shattered when the village idiot steals a handful of coins from the dragon's hoard. |
| 7 | Blightstraw's Fall. Goblins dressed as bullywugs cavort around a wicker effigy of **Bavlorna Blightstraw**. Adventurers stumble upon the scene and trick the "bullywugs" into betraying and killing the toadish hag. |
| 8 | An Island of Death in an Ocean of Tears. Explorers arrive on an island littered with bones. It takes them years to realize they're all dead. |

**Endelyn Moongrave** (see appendix B for her stat block) is not usually present during rehearsals, but on this occasion she has foreseen the characters' arrival and is watching them through a pair of opera glasses from a 40-foot-high balcony (area M21). The characters are welcomed to Motherhorn by Stagefright, the theater's goblin master of ceremonies. After introductions are made, Stagefright invites the characters to join him on the stage, whereupon he bows before Endelyn and says to her, "Your guests have arrived." The hag doesn't waste time with pleasantries (see "Bargaining with Endelyn" earlier in the chapter) and prefers to remain on her balcony. If attacked without provocation, she withdraws into her stronghold and makes her way to area M22, leaving her darkling minions (see below) to deal with the threat.

***Actors.*** Three actors are huddled together on stage, nervously rehearsing their lines from pages of a script. All three are **commoners** (neutral) with proficiency in the Performance skill and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. In a pinch, they can fight with prop weapons that function as clubs. The actors are working off debts to Endelyn and aren't looking for trouble. They are as follows:

- Elanys, a female Silvanesti (high elf) from a world called Krynn
- Granam, a male goblin from the world of Eberron
- Helgelar Sunlost, a nonbinary mountain dwarf from a world called Oerth

***Audience.*** Seated on the stone benches and facing the stage are twenty-five **darklings** (see *appendix C*) wearing cloaks and hoods. Endelyn forces them to watch rehearsals as well as performances, not only to torment the darklings but also to make sure the actors and the goblin stagehands behave themselves. Despite the poor treatment they receive from her, the darklings defend Endelyn and obey her commands without question.

***Stage.*** The stage is hewn from solid rock, with patches of moss or lichen growing here and there. It's a 10,000-foot drop from the top of the outer walls that surround the stage to the base of the mountain.

Two wooden cranes that extend from the rear of the stage are used to hoist large props and backdrops from the workshop (area M11) to the stage. One unarmed goblin (neutral noncombatant) operates each crane. These crane operators, named Specklenose and Zolt, are also Feenia's parents (see the "Evil Kite" random encounter). After Feenia was caught stealing props, her parents were forced to surrender their shadows to Endelyn as punishment for being "bad parents." Ever since then, they have been shunned by their peers (see the "Shadowless" sidebar earlier in the chapter). The characters might have encountered the goblins' detached shadows in the "Goblin Shadows" random encounter; if those shadows were destroyed, Specklenose and Zolt have their normal shadows back and are no longer being shunned.

The lighting rig built over the stage is an intricate wooden device operated by four unarmed goblins (neutral noncombatants) in theater masks. Mounted to the rig are a dozen shuttered cylinders, each one with a *continual flame* spell cast inside it. The flames come in different colors, but they give off no heat. The goblins can swivel these cylinders to focus the lights on different parts of the stage, and they use the shutters on the cylinders to adjust the lights' brightness.

The cranes and the lighting rig were constructed by brigganocks and are manipulated by iron ropes made of korred hair. Any character who knows the korreds' special jig (see "Korred Dance" earlier in the chapter) can command the hair to operate these contraptions; otherwise, a device can be manually operated by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

### M3. Stage Left

>>A wooden platform is embedded in the stone floor at the end of this corridor. An iron lever is fixed to the wall nearby.
>>

Stagehands use this elevator to carry smaller props from the workshop (area M11) to the stage. The elevator can carry up to 750 pounds and is raised or lowered using the iron lever.

### M4. Prop Storage
When the characters first explore either of these two storerooms (area M4a or M4b), read:

>>This room is choked with a variety of props and costumes. There seems to be no order to the place.
>>

Endelyn has amassed a great hoard of props and costumes, which are piled haphazardly in these rooms by goblin stagehands. Each storeroom has a few oddities as well, as described below.

***M4a.*** This room's contents include the following oddities:

- A chest full of powdered wigs, each one crawling with harmless spiders
- A mousetrap 3 feet wide and 8 feet long
- A parasol topped with a copper weather vane

***M4b.*** This room's contents include the following oddities:

- A 3-foot-high plaster pedestal on which perches a small, leering gargoyle
- A gilded throne with a small iron key hidden under its velvet seat cushion (the key, which can be felt by anyone who sits on the throne and can be found by anyone who lifts the cushion, unlocks the wooden chest in area M22)
- A small wooden cradle with a baby goblin doll in it (the doll cries for 1 minute when a key sticking out of its neck is turned)

### M5. Dressing Room

>>Resting against the walls of this circular chamber are three dressing tables, each one with a mirror atop it. The mirrors are bordered by tiny balls of bright golden light. An ornate, high-backed chair on clawed feet sits before each table. Slumped in one of the chairs is a bugbear dressed as a green dragon from the neck down. On the floor nearby are the fake dragon head and tail that complete the costume.
>>

If the bugbear's **detached shadow** in area M12 has not been defeated, add:

>>This bugbear looks all the more unusual because he casts no shadow.
>>

Performers prepare themselves for the stage here; the tables are strewn with gaudy makeup, dusting powders, and perfume bottles that give off pungent odors.

***Hurly the Bugbear.*** The **bugbear**, named Hurly (chaotic good), slouches in his chair and gazes into a mirror. Reflected back at him is a sickly, haggard version of himself (see "Magic Mirrors" below). He is dressed to portray the green dragon in the tragedy titled A Village No More, but he has given up trying to remember his lines.

Hurly used to work at the Witchlight Carnival, but his short temper and blustery nature made him unpopular. One of Endelyn's spies lured him to Motherhorn, where the hag promised to make Hurly more likable before sending him back to the carnival—but only after he agreed to relinquish his shadow and work in Endelyn's theater for three years. Hurly recently learned from another actor that three years in the Feywild doesn't necessarily equate to three years where he came from, so he's no longer certain how long Endelyn expects him to remain at the theater. The hag assures Hurly that his talent is becoming more refined and respected with every performance—but the magic mirrors in this room tell him a different story. It's clear to Hurly that his dreadful performances are not endearing him to anyone, Endelyn most of all.

Hurly expects to be demoted to stagehand and wishes he had never left the Witchlight Carnival. His failure to win over audiences is due in part to his missing shadow, as explained in the "Shadowless" sidebar earlier in the chapter. If Hurly regains his shadow, his performances will garner a better reception, although he doesn't know that yet.

*Appendix D* contains additional roleplaying notes for Hurly.

***Magic Mirrors.*** Each dressing table mirror is lit by magic orbs of light affixed to its frame and enchanted to display an image that corresponds to a performer's standing with Endelyn. What a creature sees in a mirror depends on how Endelyn feels about that creature:

- If Endelyn is tolerant or unaware of the onlooker, the image is the performer's normal appearance.
- If the onlooker is out of favor with Endelyn, the image is a sickly and haggard version of the creature.
- If Endelyn is plotting the onlooker's demise, the image is a skeleton wearing the onlooker's clothes.

Each of the three mirrors is a Small object with AC 13, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If a mirror is destroyed, poison gas billows up from its shards, filling the room. Each creature in the room must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The gas doesn't spread beyond this room and dissipates quickly.

### M6. Performers' Quarters

>>The walls of this gloomy chamber are lined with black-veiled compartments that contain makeshift beds. The furniture is sparse: a few wooden tables and chairs, a box of junk in one corner, and flickering lanterns resting here and there. Five performers occupy the room. Two of them pace nervously while the others weep.
>>

The actors here perform their roles reluctantly and are eager to leave, but cannot do so yet; each either has an unfulfilled bargain with the hag or has displeased her somehow and is working to win back her favor. All five performers are unarmed **commoners** (neutral), and the nonhuman ones have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. They are as follows:

- Elemic the Excellent (a male human from the world of Toril) sobs in his bunk.
- Diamanda Mistriddle (a female forest gnome from a world whose name is unknown to her) buries her face in a cushion on the floor to hide her tears.
- Puff Rivernoggin-Lemonseed (a male lightfoot halfling from what he terms "the Known World") cries while studying script pages that have become wrinkled from his tears.
- Elegy (a female tiefling who claims to hail from Sigil) paces while talking to a tiefling skull.
- Klee Westerly (a nonbinary human from the world of Tal'dorei) paces angrily while muttering his lines.

All five actors urge the characters to leave Motherhorn before the hag, whom they refer to as Creeping Lyn or Bitter End, snares them in her traps. Given a chance, one or more of the actors also share the following information:

- "Even if Creeping Lyn hates you, it's still possible to win her favor by telling a gruesome or depressing story on her stage—that's what we're all trying to do."
- "Storms provide the lightning that Bitter End needs to power her contraptions. Without them, the show can't go on."
- "The hag's greatest contraption is the Orrery of Tragedies, which allows her to glimpse many possible futures. Time and again, she has foreseen her own demise and taken measures to delay it for as long as possible."

***Treasure.*** The box in the corner contains the belongings of actors who have perished in Motherhorn. (Some died of natural causes; others succumbed at the hands of Endelyn, her minions, or jealous rivals.) Among the junk can be found the following treasures:

- A powder brush with a painted handle sculpted to resemble a bunch of roses (25 gp)
- A gold hand mirror that removes wrinkles, blemishes, and scars from the onlooker's reflection (250 gp)
- A fully charged *wand of web*

### M7. Oracular Library

>>This magnificent hall is lined with stone bookshelves housing a library of leather-bound tomes. Three elderly, bespectacled goblins climb ladders to fetch books for three slender, cloaked figures who are reading while seated in overstuffed armchairs.
>>

The three goblins (neutral) are unarmed noncombatants who keep this library clean and organized. The cloaked figures seated in the armchairs are three **darkling elders** (see *appendix C*) who read to pass the time. Endelyn recently informed them that she's expecting visitors, so the elders aren't surprised to see the characters and are initially indifferent toward them. That indifference turns to hostility if the characters attack the elders.

***Tales from the Gloaming Court, Vol. 3.*** Characters who examine the bookshelves spot one book that looks out of place among the others. It is a hefty, green-covered tome with a withered frog stitched into its spine. Kissing the frog or stroking it with a moistened finger causes the frog to croak the book's title in Elvish. This book is volume 3 of an eleven-book series titled Tales from the Gloaming Court.

Endelyn stole this book and its companion (in area M17) from her sister Skabatha's private library (see area L14 in *chapter 3*). The hag has tucked a thin, wax-stoppered vial inside the spine of the book. A character who examines the book before opening it spots the vial with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check and can use an action to try to remove it, doing so with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check.

On a check that fails by 5 or more or if a character opens the book without first removing the vial, the container shatters, releasing a cloud of *mummy dust* that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the book. The dust spreads around corners and settles quickly. Any creature in the dust cloud must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. A creature cursed in this way can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by a *remove curse* spell or similar magic.

***Endelyn's Black Books.*** The remaining books, of which there are hundreds, are of similar manufacture. Each one is 8 inches tall, 3 inches wide, and spineless, its black wooden covers and yellow pages held together with copper wire. The image of an hourglass is burned into the front cover of each book, and carved into the wood above it is a smaller symbol that resembles a chicken's foot.

These thin books contain handwritten accounts of every terrible future that Endelyn has glimpsed using the Orrery of Tragedies in area M14. These accounts are written by Endelyn herself as rhymes in the Elvish script. Throughout these records, Endelyn acknowledges that not every future she glimpses comes to pass, for any possible future can be negated by another. The black books are arranged on the shelves in the order in which Endelyn has written them. No book mentions the characters or anyone closely associated with them; most of the accounts speak of individuals who are long dead, many of them victims of tragedies of their own making. Endelyn foreshadows her own doom quite often, noting that it will occur during an eclipse.

Characters who spend at least 1 hour perusing these texts find the following three verses that pertain to Endelyn, Iggwilv, and the Hourglass Coven:

>*All I've wrought shall come undone*
>
>*When the moon blots out the sun.*
>

>*The sweet treachery we three have wrought—*
>
>*Would Iggwilv forgive us? Ha! I think not*.
>

>*Time was our ally, standing beside us,*
>
>*Giving us that which Mummy denied us.*
>
>*But now, I feel its hands turn cold*
>
>*And see its second sight unfold:*
>
>*The hourglass broken, the sisters three*
>
>*Meeting our hellish destiny.*
>
>*Bav and Skab will never know*
>
>*That Time has always been our foe.*
>

***Skabatha's Secret.*** Endelyn knows that her sister, Skabatha, is cursed to forget the first creature she sees when she wakes each morning. In the event of Endelyn's death, she wants this secret to be known, so Endelyn wrote it on a scrap of invisible paper and placed it atop the highest shelf in the library. The paper becomes visible and blows off the shelf if Endelyn dies, which can happen only during an eclipse. If the characters enter this room after Endelyn has died, the paper is lying on the floor in plain view. Written in the Elvish script, it reads:

>*Every morn when Skabatha rises,*
>
>*The one first seen by her waking eyeses*
>
>*Is swiftly forgotten like some fleeting swain*
>
>*And shan't be remembered 'til she sleeps again.*
>

### M8. Endelyn's Mask Collection

>>The walls of this room are adorned with wooden masks, most of which look like shocked goblin faces. Dozens of masks hang neatly from hooks on the walls, and several more are stowed haphazardly on the shelves of an old bookcase.
>>
>>Two padlocked cages stand in a far corner; one is occupied by a panic-stricken goblin, and the other is empty.
>>
>>In the middle of the room, two copper poles ten feet apart descend from the eight-foot ceiling. Each pole has a one-foot-diameter copper sphere at the end of it, three feet off the floor. Between the poles, a struggling goblin is shackled to a thin, tall chair, so that the spheres are level with the goblin's head.
>>
>>A tall, thin, cloaked figure stands in the shadows. A rictus grin forms beneath the cowl as the figure pulls a lever that juts from a wall. An instant later, golden lightning leaps between the spheres, catching the shackled goblin in its path. Before you can react, the goblin transforms into a wooden mask that falls to the floor. "Binky!" shrieks the caged goblin.
>>

Endelyn uses the lightning-powered arcane device in this room to punish those who irritate her. The device has 3 charges and regains all expended charges after 8 hours. Pulling the lever expends 1 charge and causes a line of golden lightning, 10 feet long and 5 feet wide, to flash between the two copper spheres. Any creature in this line must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be magically transformed into an inanimate wooden mask, along with whatever it is wearing or carrying. The mask bears a striking resemblance to the creature's visage, and the transformation lasts until the mask is targeted by a successful *dispel magic* spell (DC 19). Every mask created in this fashion is a Tiny wooden object with AC 15, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A mask that is reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed and can't be transformed back into the creature it once was.

Each copper rod is a Medium object with AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to lightning, poison, and psychic damage. The lever is a Small object with AC 15, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying the lever or either rod renders the device inoperable until it is repaired.

The creature holding the lever is a **darkling elder** (see *appendix C*) who takes sadistic pleasure in turning other creatures into masks. A female **goblin** (neutral) named Vig is locked in one of the cages and is doomed to suffer the same fate as her friend, Binky, unless the characters intervene on her behalf. Both goblins worked the cranes in area M2 until they accidentally dropped a backdrop in the middle of a performance, ruining the show and angering Endelyn. If the characters attack the darkling elder, it fights back. At the same time, Vig shouts in Common, "Leave me to my fate! Bitter End can do worse than turn me into a mask!"

As an action, a character using thieves' tools can try to pick the lock on either cage or the shackles on the chair, doing so with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check. The darkling carries a ring of three keys, two of which open the padlocks on the cages; the third key unlocks the chair's shackles.

Endelyn's poor treatment of her notwithstanding, Vig wants to please the hag. The goblin enjoys working at Motherhorn, though she dislikes Stagefright, the goblin master of ceremonies. Vig knows her way around Motherhorn and shares the following information with her rescuers:

- Bitter End has a pair of magic scissors that she uses to snip off other creatures' shadows. These detached shadows congregate in the shadow theater (area M10).
- To enter the prison (area M17), one needs the fool's scepter that belongs to Endelyn's master of ceremonies, Stagefright.
- The hag has a special guest—a hateful woman named Charmay, who claims to get her magic from a pact she made with Baba Yaga. Charmay has powerful friends and belongs to a group called the League of Something-or-Other. She doesn't like goblins and mistreats them every chance she gets. (Vig can't remember the name of the League of Malevolence, but she can lead characters to "Charmay" in area M11.)

### M9. Backdrop Hallway

>>This shadowy hallway is blocked by a wooden backdrop ten feet from the entrance. The backdrop is painted to look like a library bookshelf.
>>

Three backdrops spaced 10 feet apart block this hall. The second one is painted to look like a raging sea, and the third looks like a moonlit graveyard. When a creature moves within 5 feet of a backdrop, it swings back against the wall, revealing more of the corridor. The backdrops remain locked in these positions for 1 minute before swinging out to block the hallway again.

***Pit Trap.*** Beyond the third backdrop, directly in front of the doorway to area M10, is a hidden pit. The lid of the pit is easily mistaken for a dusty flagstone and opens when a weight of 50 pounds or more is placed on it. Any creature standing on the lid when it opens must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit, which is 20 feet deep but filled to a depth of 10 feet with grave dirt. After falling 10 feet, a creature lands prone in the dirt but takes no damage. Leaning against one wall of the pit is a tombstone prop made of wood painted to look like stone. It is engraved with the name of the first creature that has just fallen into the pit. This engraving is a harmless illusion that fades after 1 minute.

### M10. Shadow Theater

>>Rows of tiered seating fill the back half of this theater, and motes of dust float and dance above the ancient upholstery. The seats face a stone stage flanked by wooden silhouettes of fir trees, lit from behind and above by a white, moon-like sphere of glass that hangs from the ceiling by a short chain and casts long shadows on the walls. Suspended above the stage is a trapeze.
>>

Eleven **shadows** occupy the theater. These shadows are Fey, not Undead, and they were created by Endelyn using her *scissors of shadow snipping* (see *appendix A*). If Gleam's **detached shadow** wasn't destroyed in chapter 1, it is one of the eleven shadows here, all of which are invisible while they remain hidden in the normal shadows being cast by the wooden silhouettes. One of the shadows, larger than the others, once belonged to Hurly the bugbear (see area M5).

If the characters disturb the wooden silhouettes enough to make their shadows change position, the detached shadows are revealed and begin prancing around silently like mimes. If Gleam's shadow is among them, it leaps onto the trapeze and swings from it.

The shadows act as Endelyn's spies and attack only if they feel threatened. Shadows that are reduced to 0 hit points are destroyed and reattach to their original owners as normal shadows.

A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 by a shadow's Strength Drain attack does not die but falls unconscious instead. The creature regains consciousness, and the reduction to its Strength score disappears, after it finishes a short or long rest.

***Moon Sphere.*** This dangling, 3-foot-diameter sphere of white glass sheds bright light out to a range of 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Casting *dispel magic* on the sphere automatically causes its light to go out.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the shadow theater find a pair of opera glasses (250 gp) resting on one seat.

### M11. Stage Workshop
This workshop is accessible from area M2 by a staircase and from area M3 by an elevator. The curtain to area M2 is drawn. A pair of sliding wooden doors opens to reveal the undercarriages of the cranes that hang below the amphitheater.

>>The cavernous underbelly of the stage is noisy and hot. Goblins work a forge, saw wood, and daub paint onto wooden backdrops. A woman in a tight-fitting dress barks orders at the workers while a goblin frantically makes adjustments to her costume using needles, pins, and thread. A tiny creature chained to a hooded lantern on a tabletop is using a stick of charcoal to sketch something on a piece of parchment at unbelievable speed. A wispy bulb of light flutters next to him.
>>

![[083-04-009.charmay.png|right|300]]

Stage props and backdrops are crafted here. Oversized items are moved through the double doors in the eastern wall, affixed to the cranes, and hoisted to the stage above. Smaller items are ferried up using the elevator to area M3, which is operated by using a lever on the adjacent wall.

Eighteen unarmed goblin noncombatants (twelve neutral adults and six unaligned children) work here, overseen by an evil warlock named **Skylla** (see appendix B). The creature chained to the hooded lantern is Golmo, an unarmed **brigganock** (see *appendix C*), accompanied by the ball of light that contains his soul. Endelyn forces Golmo to draw diagrams for various contraptions, and his sketches can be found on scores of loose sheets of parchment. He uses his Time Lapse action as often as possible to produce his designs quickly.

***Skylla.*** **Skylla** was treated to a puppet show during which Endelyn revealed a "likely future" in which **Skylla** is fatally betrayed by the other members of the League of Malevolence. This revelation prompted **Skylla** to defect from the group and take refuge at Motherhorn. **Skylla** carries the key to Golmo's chains and willingly parts with it only if doing so might save her life.

Even though she is costumed, **Skylla** is instantly recognizable to any member of Valor's Call. She is looking forward to making her onstage debut as her alter ego, Charmay, in a one-woman play she wrote herself titled *Lamentations of a Warlock*. **Skylla** is currently being outfitted for her role by a flustered goblin tailor, who keeps accidentally sticking her with dressmaking pins as they both move around the room.

**Skylla** becomes enraged whenever the goblins forget to address her as "Charmay," and she keeps a close eye on Golmo, locking him in the lantern when he's not working.

If she meets intruders in the workshop, **Skylla** utters a command word taught to her by Endelyn ("nocturli"), which bestows a semblance of life upon eight inanimate props scattered throughout the workshop. Each of these props uses the **animated armor** stat block (with Armor Class modifications as noted below) and tries to repel intruders while the goblins cower behind backdrops. The animated props are as follows:

- A 4-foot-long, crooked stove pipe (AC 19)
- A wrought-iron gate (AC 19)
- A plain, empty wooden coffin (AC 15)
- A plaster statue of an elf king clutching a scepter (AC 13)
- A plaster wedding cake stuck to a small table (AC 13)
- A stuffed boar mannequin (AC 11)
- A 6-foot-tall, stuffed canvas flesh golem (AC 11)
- A 7-foot-tall, painted wooden statue of an owlbear on its hind legs (AC 15)

While the animated props serve as a distraction, **Skylla** stuffs Golmo in the lantern and makes her way upstairs to area M2, where she can trust the darklings to defend her, with the hapless goblin tailor dogging **Skylla**'s heels. If **Skylla** is pinned down and forced to surrender to avoid certain death, she can cause the animated props to revert to their inanimate forms by uttering the word "alfarian."

**Skylla** feels no loyalty to the League of Malevolence. If characters mention the league, she boastfully reveals the following information about her former crew:

- The leader of the League of Malevolence is **Kelek**, whose driving ambition is to steal the magic staff from his archenemy, **Ringlerun**.
- **Kelek** came to Prismeer to blackmail Zybilna into taking **Ringlerun**'s staff. **Skylla** doesn't know what leverage **Kelek** has over Zybilna, but it must be considerable.
- **Skylla** betrayed the League of Malevolence by leaking **Kelek**'s plans to the Hourglass Coven. When the league's members arrived at the palace, the hags used them to create a diversion while the sisters rebelled against Zybilna. The League of Malevolence now works for the hags, albeit unwillingly. **Skylla** is proud of the trouble she has caused her former comrades.

The following information must be pried from **Skylla** using magic or force:

- Zybilna is an alias used by the archmage Iggwilv, who hails from a world called Oerth.
- Iggwilv is the adopted daughter of Baba Yaga, unlike the hags of the Hourglass Coven, who are true daughters of the Mother of Witches.
- The hags used *Iggwilv's Cauldron*, a powerful artifact crafted with help from Baba Yaga, to trap Iggwilv in time. The cauldron can be destroyed by a *flame tongue* sword, just like the one wielded by **Kelek**'s evil bodyguard, **Warduke**.

***Golmo the Architect.*** Golmo is timid and weary, and his workload is relentless. When he gets a moment's rest, he slumps down inside the lantern and quickly falls asleep. He would like very much to be allowed to return to Brigganock Mine.

As an action, a character using thieves' tools can try to pick the lock on Golmo's chain, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A character can instead use an action to try to break the chain by making a successful DC 12 Strength check. If freed, Golmo takes refuge in the pocket or pouch of one of the characters. Given a chance, he throws his diagrams in the fire, ensuring that Endelyn can never use them.

***Treasure.*** **Skylla** has an *eldritch staff* (see *appendix A*), which she keeps within easy reach.

A search of the workshop uncovers the following treasures:

- A hammer with a gold handle (25 gp)
- A two-person saw made from a wyvern's jaw (75 gp)
- A set of mason's tools embossed with the seal of Moradin's own forge (250 gp)

***Unicorn Horn.*** If the *Story Tracker* indicates that the unicorn horn is here, it is in **Skylla**'s possession. The warlock either stole it from the Hourglass Coven or acquired it from the darkling merchants in area M16; regardless, she keeps it on her person at all times. She doesn't want it falling into **Kelek**'s hands but willingly parts with it to save her own skin.

### M12. Parts Storage
The secret tunnel from Brigganock Mine leads here. If the characters enter Motherhorn this way, read:

>>The tunnel ends at a wall of loose-fitting stones. Red light shines through the cracks, and you hear the sounds of shouting and hammering coming from somewhere beyond the wall.
>>

The stones blocking the end of the tunnel can be easily moved to create a 3-foot-square opening.

When the characters peer into this room, either from the workshop (area M11) or the brigganock tunnel, read:

>>Crates of props are stacked in this chamber alongside wooden backdrops draped in cobwebs. An eight-foot-diameter, circular wooden disk painted to look like a smiling moon leans against one wall.
>>
>>From a cluttered corner, a raspy voice says, "Psst! Over here!" Glancing in that direction, you see a wooden marionette carved and painted to look like a human skeleton. It appears to be tangled in its own strings. "I seem to have gotten myself in a wee fix."
>>

The wooden marionette is Break-a-leg (use the **living doll** stat block in *appendix C*). It lies in a heap, its strings in disarray and its limbs jumbled. Until its strings are untangled and its limbs properly oriented, Break-a-leg is restrained and can't use its Grabby Hands action or take reactions. A character who spends 1 minute trying to untangle its strings can make a DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, freeing the marionette on a successful check. If freed, Break-a-leg springs to its feet and shakes each character by the finger. Its jaw moves up and down as it talks, and its head can rotate 360 degrees. The skeleton marionette always turns its head to face whomever it is speaking to.

Break-a-leg was Endelyn's first experiment with living puppetry. A flaw in its creation process kept it from having the sadistic streak that the hag wanted, so she discarded it. It knows Motherhorn's layout and the nature of its inhabitants, though not their exact whereabouts. It doesn't like Endelyn and willingly shares the following secrets:

- Endelyn is terrified of eclipses (this is Motherhorn's worst kept secret, Break-a-leg admits).
- Endelyn wrote a secret about her sister, Skabatha, on a piece of invisible parchment that she keeps in the oracular library (area M7).
- If the lightning rods atop Motherhorn are destroyed or stolen, Endelyn can't operate her arcane contraptions.

Break-a-leg wants to escape Motherhorn. If the characters entered from Brigganock Mine, the marionette strikes off that way on its own; otherwise, it asks the characters to let it tag along with them.

***Fake Moon.*** The wooden disk painted to look like a moon weighs 50 pounds. It has a small iron ring screwed into its top so that it can be hung from a hook above the stage. If Glister (see area M17) hides behind the moon while wearing her sun mask, the two images create a symbolic eclipse that can help seal Endelyn's fate.

### M13. Worker Cells

>>Six dingy cells strung with hammocks line both sides of this corridor. Loud snoring comes from one cell, and the noise of a rumbling stomach from another.
>>

Two unarmed noncombatants occupy the cells. Wart, a male goblin (neutral), is sound asleep; Kizz, a female goblin (neutral good), is too hungry to sleep and sits in her cell, nibbling her toenails. If the characters offer food to Kizz, she gratefully accepts and tells them three secrets by way of compensation:

- She found a key and hid it under the seat cushion of a throne in one of the prop rooms (area M4b). Kizz doesn't know what the key unlocks.
- Goblins who anger Creeping Lyn are turned into wooden masks. A few guests have been treated the same way.
- There's a belfry in one of Motherhorn's turrets (area M20), but Creeping Lyn boarded it up.

### M14. Orrery of Tragedies

>>This cylindrical chamber houses a whirring contraption bolted to a revolving metal disk that serves as its base. Metal spheres and sickles are attached to the ends of long metal arms that sweep back and forth, clicking loudly and rhythmically like the hands of a giant metronome. The apparatus is inlaid with characters from strange alphabets, and smoky wisps in the shapes of these letters rise from the contraption as it revolves. The whole device hums and crackles with lightning.
>>
>>Rising from the middle of the mechanism is an eighty-foot-tall copper pole made of eight ten-foot-long lightning rods attached end to end. It extends upward past a ring-shaped gallery that forms the chamber's upper level, through a hole in the fifty-foot-high domed ceiling.
>>
>>Three goblins wearing overalls and tinted goggles use brooms to sweep the floor, seemingly untroubled by the noise.
>>

When she's not watching plays from her ornithopter pad (area M21) or asleep in her room (area M22), **Endelyn Moongrave** is on the balcony (area M19) that hangs 20 feet above this chamber, where she can be seen by characters who look up. She is positioned in front of the door to area M22. If the other hags were forced to flee their lairs in Hither and Thither, **Bavlorna Blightstraw** and **Skabatha Nightshade** are on the side of the viewing gallery opposite where Endelyn stands, trying to make sense of their sister's wicked contraption. See appendix B for the hags' stat blocks.

Creatures on the balcony have three-quarters cover against attacks made by creatures on the floor below and vice versa, due to the mechanism's many moving parts. Members of the Hourglass Coven who find themselves at risk of being captured or killed flee to the Palace of Heart's Desire (see *chapter 5*) using their vehicles or mounts, which are parked in area M21.

***Contraption.*** The Orrery of Tragedies is 20 feet tall and 60 feet in diameter. It uses magic and mathematics to produce its prognostications, and it can sift through possible futures to identify the most likely ones. As the contraption turns, it emits smoke in the form of letters that spell out predictions, which Endelyn transcribes in a black book like the ones shelved in the oracular library (area M7). The orrery magically predicts the future of creatures whose paths are destined to become entwined with the Hourglass Coven and who are doomed to meet a tragic end. It serves no other purpose.

The device is powered by electricity transmitted through its central element: an 80-foot-tall lightning rod that forms its vertical axis. A creature that touches any part of the lightning rod, enters the contraption's space for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn in the contraption's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in metal armor makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

The Orrery of Tragedies isn't one object, but dozens of smaller objects joined together. To destroy the whole thing, at least eight of its components (not including the lightning rod) must be reduced to 0 hit points. Each component is a Large object with AC 19, 27 hit points, and immunity to lightning, poison, and psychic damage.

The central lightning rod is eight 10-foot-long lightning rods attached end to end. Each smaller rod weighs 100 pounds and has AC 17, 25 hit points, and immunity to lightning, poison, and psychic damage. Reducing one of these rods to 0 hit points destroys it and causes the rods above it to fall, making the lowest rod the most obvious target. If three or more of these rods fall or are destroyed, the assembly is no longer tall enough to conduct lightning; the contraption shuts down after 1 minute and remains powerless until the lightning rod assembly is rebuilt.

Contact with an antimagic field shuts down the contraption for the field's duration. A successful *dispel magic* spell (DC 19) causes the contraption to shut down for 1 minute, though it remains charged with lightning during this time.

![[084-04-010.endelyns-orrery-of-tragedies.png|right|300]]

***Goblins.*** The goblins sweeping the floor are unarmed noncombatants (neutral evil) named Dungus, Kak, and Spoorx. They wear tinted goggles to protect their eyes from the flashes of light that the contraption gives off. They are tight-lipped and would never willingly betray Endelyn. If combat breaks out here between Endelyn and the characters, the goblins flee down the nearby spiral staircase.

### M15. Theater Boxes
Two 20-foot-high balconies overlook the stage (area M2), with stone steps leading up to them. Use the following boxed text to describe the balconies if the characters approach them from the amphitheater:

>>Two stone balconies are fringed with thick drapes of musty velvet trimmed with black lace, and the black marble railings are decorated with leering alabaster masks. A large, square mirror set in the wall behind each balcony is flanked by wooden panels painted with thunderclouds and lightning bolts. An upholstered bench on each balcony faces a grand view of the stage and the stormy sky.
>>

Each mirror is an 8-foot-square pane of two-way glass with AC 13, 4 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Hidden behind the two-way mirror is a semicircular room containing a pair of padded armchairs that face the mirror, allowing those in the chamber to observe the theater boxes without being seen.

### M16. Darkling Balloon Dock
The door to area M14 is closed but not locked.

>>This tower contains a sparsely furnished guest room attached to a stone balcony. The door connecting them swings back and forth in the wind.
>>

If Trinket, Bauble, and Charm's rain cloud balloon (see *chapter 2*) is tethered to the balcony and the characters have not already seen it or destroyed it, add:

>>An enormous flying balloon made from a bulging rain cloud is tethered to the balcony's battlements.
>>

If Charm the **darkling elder** and her two cohorts, the **darklings** Trinket and Bauble, fled Hither in their rain cloud balloon, all three are lurking in the guest room (see *appendix C* for their stat blocks). Charm's **detached shadow** is also present unless the characters destroyed it earlier in the adventure. Like other detached shadows found in Motherhorn, Charm's shadow is a Fey, not an Undead. A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 by the shadow's Strength Drain attack does not die but falls unconscious instead. The creature regains consciousness, and the reduction to its Strength score disappears, after it finishes a short or long rest.

If Charm's shadow stole the magic spool of thread from Bavlorna's cottage in chapter 2, it gave the item to Charm at the earliest opportunity. The darkling elder is patiently awaiting an audience with Endelyn and plans to offer up the spool of thread as a gift to gain the hag's favor. Charm won't give up the spool of thread without a fight.

The darklings are merchants and thieves, not cold-blooded killers. They take no offense at the characters' intrusion and are willing to do business, provided the characters do not threaten them.

If the darklings are not here, the room is unoccupied, and no treasure can be found among the tower's furnishings.

***Unicorn Horn.*** If the *Story Tracker* indicates that the darklings have the unicorn horn, that fact no longer applies if the characters encounter the darklings here. When she saw that the darklings had the horn, **Skylla** the warlock (see area M11) convinced them to give it to her, rather than risk other members of the League of Malevolence taking it from them by force.

### M17. Prison
Access to this area is blocked by a featureless stone door that can't be opened magically, with thieves' tools, or by force.

>>Two rusty suits of armor sized for goblins and equipped with halberds flank a large stone door bereft of handles, hinges, or decoration.
>>

Characters who examine the rusty suits of armor discover that each one has the inanimate skeleton of a goblin propped up inside it. Lifting the rusty visor on either suit's helmet reveals its grinning skull, and removing the helmet entirely causes the goblin's skull to tumble onto the floor. The suits topple over easily, producing a loud clatter as the armor and skeletons break apart on the floor.

Disturbing either suit of armor or touching the surface of the door causes a large, skeletal version of Endelyn's gaunt visage to appear on the door, open its mouth, and say, "You shall not pass! Back, I command you!" The face on the door can see and hear whatever's in front of it, and its open mouth forms a 1-foot-high, 3-foot-wide hole through the door; as the visage speaks, characters who peer into the mouth can catch a glimpse of an empty room beyond (see "Inside the Prison" below).

If the door sees Endelyn within 5 feet of it, or if someone taps the door using the fool's scepter that belongs to Stagefright, it opens its mouth wide enough to create an 8-foot-high, 3-foot-wide archway that remains open until 1 minute elapses without a creature passing through it.

If neither of the above options applies, a character can trick the door into opening its mouth long enough for one creature to pass through it before the mouth snaps shut. Each of the following tricks works once:

- A character who yawns within 10 feet of the door causes the door to yawn as well, enabling one creature to slip through its mouth.
- A character who spends at least 1 minute reciting a dull monologue, soliloquy, or poem within 10 feet of the door causes the door to yawn out of boredom, enabling one creature to slip through its mouth.
- A character who stands within 10 feet of the door and recites a funny joke or limerick causes the door to laugh, enabling one creature to slip through its open mouth.

Inventive characters can use the halberds from the suits of armor (or weapons of their own) to wedge open the mouth, preventing it from closing until these obstructions are removed. No ability check is needed to accomplish this. If the characters come up with a different creative solution, you can reward their creativity with automatic success.

***Inside the Prison.*** Four cells sealed by stone doors branch off from the walls of this empty chamber. Stone levers jutting from the walls next to the doorways are used to raise and lower the cell doors, which can't be opened from the inside except by the use of a *knock* spell or similar magic. Each one has a small window through which its contents can be seen.

Unless the characters have been detained here, three of the cells are open and unoccupied. The fourth cell is closed and holds Gleam's twin, Glister (use the **Selenelion twin** stat block in *appendix C*). Describe the cell and its occupant as follows:

>>An elf, her face partially hidden under a sun mask, is curled up on a divan, reading a book while sipping wine from a thin crystal goblet. Other items in the cell include a crystal decanter of wine and a bowl of figs on a small table, a gold-embroidered wall tapestry depicting a wooded elven realm, and a porcelain chamber pot decorated with gold filigree.
>>

Glister is comfortable—if not happy—in her cell. Endelyn has urged Glister, for the sake of her twin sibling, to be a good, quiet houseguest. If Gleam is with the characters, she and Glister are reunited. The twins try not to get separated again; their goal is to reach the Fey Beacons (described earlier in the chapter) and use them to get back home to the Witchlight Carnival, with or without the characters' help.

Glister knows the following useful information, which she shares with her rescuers:

- "I overheard some goblins talking about a belfry in one of the turrets. Endelyn boarded up the belfry to prevent others from ringing the bell. Apparently, it's the safest, fastest way to reach the Palace of Heart's Desire."
- "Endelyn lost a key and is upset about it. Her minions have been searching for it, to no avail." (Glister doesn't know that one of the goblins found the key and hid it in area M4.)
- "If my sister and I can reach the Fey Beacons, we can use them to return to the Witchlight Carnival." (This is Glister's ultimate goal.)

***Glister's Plan.*** If the characters need some direction on how to deal with Endelyn, Glister has plotted her revenge against the hag and suggests the following course of action:

>>"Endelyn can be destroyed for good, but only during an eclipse. I say we create one! There is a moon prop in storage. If I were to stand behind it while wearing my sun mask, the moon would eclipse the sun. Were this configuration to occur in Endelyn's presence, she would know her doom is at hand."
>>

The moon prop can be found in area M12.

Glister and Gleam are willing to go along with any other plan the characters conceive, but the sisters always have each other's safety uppermost in their minds. *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Glister.

***Tales from the Gloaming Court, Vol. 8.*** The book Glister is reading is a hefty, green-covered tome with a withered frog stitched into its spine. Kissing the frog or stroking it with a moistened finger causes the frog to croak the book's title in Elvish. This book is volume 8 of an eleven-book series titled Tales from the Gloaming Court.

Endelyn stole this book and its companion in area M7 from her sister Skabatha's private library (see area L14 in *chapter 3*). Stagefright lent the book to Glister without Endelyn's knowledge when the elf complained that she was bored. Glister doesn't take the book with her when she leaves her cell, because she finds the intrigues of the Gloaming Court quite dull.

***Treasure.*** Glister's cell contains the following items of value:

- A porcelain chamber pot with gold filigree (50 gp)
- A crystal wine decanter (125 gp) and goblet (25 gp)
- An embroidered tapestry depicting a woodland realm of the elves (250 gp)

### M18. Audience Chamber

>>The walls of this chamber are jet black, with gold-painted scrollwork where the walls meet the ceiling and each other. Ornate, high-backed armchairs face a raised dais. An alcove at the back of the dais is half hidden by a black curtain.
>>

This chamber is unoccupied until **Endelyn Moongrave** (see appendix B) has need of it. The hag uses the room for private meetings with visitors, particularly those who want to know their futures or who want to strike bargains with her. Endelyn stands in the otherwise empty alcove when performing her auguries (described below).

A *detect magic* spell cast on the alcove reveals an aura of conjuration magic emanating from it. While standing in the alcove, Endelyn can use a bonus action to speak a command word ("imprek") and teleport to her wardrobe in area M22, along with anything she is wearing or carrying, provided the wardrobe's main compartment is empty and the wardrobe hasn't been destroyed.

***Endelyn's Auguries.*** The Orrery of Tragedies in area M14 allows Endelyn to foresee the arrival of visitors and glimpse their fates, which she communicates to them through grim performances that she calls her "auguries." Endelyn claims to be the sole source of these prognostications while failing to mention that the orrery shows possible futures, not necessarily the future.

Endelyn performs auguries for characters who want to know their futures and who strike a proper bargain with her (as described in "Bargaining with Endelyn" earlier in the chapter).

If the characters ask her to conduct auguries for them, read:

>>Draped in black robes, the hag peers down at you from her curtained alcove. Her long fingers twitch, and extra hands appear from within the folds of her ghastly dress. She gazes upon each of you in turn before saying, "Seekers of fate, you have come before the Dame of Unhappy Endings to glimpse your doom. Behold!"
>>
>>The hag unveils a puppet theater that was hidden in her clothing. It includes stringed marionettes that resemble you and your companions. With each tug of the strings, the puppets bob around the stage, speaking in the hag's scratchy voice.
>>

Drawing on information fed to her by the Orrery of Tragedies, Endelyn performs a macabre puppet show that reveals how each character is fated to depart the multiverse. Have each player roll a d8 and consult the Unhappy Endings table to find out how Endelyn predicts that player's character might die. (You can devise other unhappy endings, if desired.)

##### Unhappy Endings
| d8 | Cause of Death |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Eaten alive by a dragon |
| 2 | Stabbed through the heart by an invisible assassin |
| 3 | Dissolved in a pool of acid |
| 4 | Pulled down into dark water and drowned |
| 5 | Hanged by the neck |
| 6 | Impaled on a stalagmite |
| 7 | Poisoned by a friend |
| 8 | Crushed by a falling castle |

### M19. Viewing Gallery
This 20-foot-high balcony looks down onto the Orrery of Tragedies (area M14).

>>The stone railing that encloses this ring-shaped balcony has balusters shaped like hourglasses.
>>

**Endelyn Moongrave** (see appendix B) spends much of her time on the side of the balcony closest to her quarters (area M22), transcribing prophecies of doom foretold by the Orrery of Tragedies. While she's working, she doesn't like to be disturbed.

Endelyn records these prophecies in a spineless book 8 inches tall and 3 inches wide. Its black wooden covers and yellow pages are held together by copper wire. The image of an hourglass is burned into the front cover. Currently, one-third of the book's pages are filled with Endelyn's spidery Elvish script.

### M20. Paper Birds and Hidden Belfry

>>Bottles filled with crackling lightning line wooden bookcases along the walls of this chamber.
>>
>>An open archway leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the amphitheater forty feet below. On the opposite side of the room from the arch is a large wooden desk, atop which a stack of parchment flutters under a stone paperweight shaped like a toad. Scattered on the desk are ink pots and ink-stained quills. Dangling from a rafter near the desk is a rusty cage that holds three folded paper birds flitting about like moths.
>>

Endelyn writes her correspondence on sheets of enchanted parchment, which she then folds into the shape of paper birds that fly to their intended recipients. If a message's recipient is on another plane of existence or is otherwise unreachable, the paper bird bursts into flames on takeoff and is instantly destroyed.

The **paper birds** are hostile toward all creatures except the hags of the Hourglass Coven. They use the **hawk** stat block, with these changes:

- The paper birds are Constructs.
- They have vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to poison and psychic damage, immunity to exhaustion, and immunity to the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions.
- They deal damage by slicing creatures with their sharp edges (the attack is otherwise identical to the hawk's Talons attack).

The cage contains three folded birds that Endelyn has prepared but hasn't released. The door to the cage is held shut by a simple latch. To catch a paper bird, a creature must reach into the cage and use an action to try to grapple it; if the grapple check succeeds, the magic on the parchment ends, rendering the bird inanimate and easy to unfold. If the cage door is left open, the paper birds fly out after a few seconds and try to deliver their messages.

The birds in the cage have the following messages written on them in the Elvish script:

>*My darling Bav*,
>
>*Skab had the horn but either lost it or forgot where she hid it. Her head is so full of cobwebs. Imagine what she'll be like when she's senile*.
>
>*Your favorite sister*,
>
>*End*
>

>*Dearest Skab*,
>
>*Mummy's little warlock spy was happy to betray her companions and reveal that Kelek, Zargash, and the others are conspiring to betray us. But fear not. Their plots will not succeed. Even now, an outside force promises to rid us of the whole stinking lot. What's important is that the Cauldron remain safe. Let me know how you wish to proceed*.
>
>*Your beloved sister*,
>
>*End*
>

>*Lord Kelek*,
>
>*I have written a new play titled The Agonies of Alagarthas. It's a tragic tale inspired by real-life misfortune that I think you might enjoy. You and the other members of the League of Malevolence are invited to Motherhorn to watch a live performance. Your missing colleague, Skylla, has been my guest for some time, but I'm afraid she has worn out her welcome. In exchange for my generosity, I'm hoping you can take her off my hands*.
>
>*Until our next meeting,*
>
>*Endelyn*
>

***Bottled Lightning.*** The hag drinks a bottle of lightning before sitting at her desk to write, granting her flashes of inspiration. The shelves hold thirty bottles of lightning. Any creature other than Endelyn that tries to drink the lightning in a bottle takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage, emptying the bottle in the process.

As an action, a creature can hurl a bottle of lightning up to 30 feet, where it shatters on impact. A creature that hurls a bottle at a specific target in range must make a ranged attack against that target. On a hit, the target takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

***Desk.*** The toad-shaped paperweight on the desk is an actual toad that was turned to stone. The sheets of parchment under it are waiting to be written on and folded into birds. If the stone toad is picked up and nothing else holds the pages down, they flutter about until someone grabs them and starts writing on them. As an action, a character can try to snatch a sheet out of the air, doing so with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Folding a sheet of parchment into a paper bird that can fly (as described above) requires 1 minute and a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

The inks and quills on the desk are unremarkable.

***Hidden Belfry.*** The room's 10-foot-high ceiling is made of loose wooden boards laid across rafters. Above these boards, hidden in the top of the turret, is a belfry. The characters can reach the boards by stacking furniture found in the turret and climbing to the top of the stack. Once they do that, the boards can be lifted away or pushed aside with ease.

The belfry contains a 50-pound silver bell attached to a 25-foot-long rope that hangs down to the floor once the false ceiling is no longer an obstacle. A verse engraved on the bell in Elvish reads:

>*Toll the bell within this spire*
>
>*To journey to your heart's desire.*
>

Ringing the bell summons a flock of giant cranes (use the **pteranodon** stat block), one for each character or NPC in the party, from the direction of the *Palace of Heart's Desire*. These birds appear on the horizon immediately and take 20 minutes to reach the tower, where they alight on the balcony. Each bird waits patiently for a rider to climb on its back. The giant cranes deliver the characters safely to the Palace of Heart's Desire, refusing to alter their course, and fly away afterward. The birds' plumage is soft and comforting, and each passenger gains the benefit of a long rest at the end of the journey.

Check the *Story Tracker*; characters who skillfully rode giant dragonflies in the Witchlight Carnival handle their cranes with such flair that they each receive a feather at the end of the journey. (The giant crane plucks the feather from itself using its beak and places it on the ground within the character's reach.) A feather allows the rewarded character (and no one else) to cast the *feather fall* spell with no components required. Once its spell is cast, the feather becomes nonmagical.

***Development.*** If the characters make use of the giant cranes, skip ahead to the "Leaving Yon" section at the end of the chapter. If the characters don't leave right away, the birds take flight back to the palace after a few minutes. Ringing the bell summons them again.

### M21. Ornithopter Pad

>>This castle turret has a forty-foot-high balcony overlooking Motherhorn's amphitheater. A wooden ornithopter sits on the balcony. It has a round bird's head with beady eyes and a metal beak, and leathery wings are folded against its chassis.
>>

If Endelyn's sisters were forced to flee to Motherhorn, here is where they park their flying mounts (Bavlorna's lily pad and Skabatha's rocking horse). Endelyn keeps her *ornithopter of flying* (see *appendix A*) on the same balcony where she watches performances, so she can fly down to the stage whenever she wants to steal the limelight.

![[085-04-011.ornithopter.png|right|300]]

### M22. Endelyn's Room
A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic on the door to this room. If a creature other than Endelyn touches the door, a hand of force similar to that created by the *Bigby's hand* spell tries to shove the creature away from the door. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed off the balcony, falling onto the Orrery of Tragedies and then tumbling 20 feet to the floor in area M14. The treacherous fall deals 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage, and if the orrery is operational, the creature takes lightning damage as well (see area M14 for details).

The magic trap on the door can be dispelled (DC 15). A character who examines the door and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check spots a faint glyph etched into the doorknob. If this glyph is defaced using the point of a dagger or some other tool, the magic is negated, and the door can be opened safely.

When the characters can see into the room, read the following boxed text aloud, modifying it accordingly if Endelyn is present:

>>Scores of wooden marionettes hang from the ceiling of this oddly shaped room, the floor of which is strewn with old play scripts. Near the entrance are two alcoves, one containing a bare table, the other holding a wooden chest with tiny, clawed feet. Deeper in the room, you see a wicker basket surrounded by miniature toy birds.
>>
>>Scores of hourglasses are fixed to the walls. Whenever the sand of an hourglass runs out, the mechanism that attaches the hourglass to the wall causes it to flip over. The steady hiss of all those falling grains of sand can be heard throughout the room.
>>
>>A large, glass-doored wardrobe with a jade eye embedded in its cornice stands on the far side of the room in a wide alcove.
>>

**Endelyn Moongrave** (see appendix B) sleeps in the glass wardrobe when she's not transcribing prophecies or watching plays. The rigid framework of her theatrical costume allows her to sleep standing up, which she must do to fit inside the wardrobe. Endelyn is a deep sleeper, so characters can sneak around while she slumbers, though she has several magical alarms in place.

***Dangling Marionettes.*** To move quietly about the room, a character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failed check, the marionettes hanging from the ceiling scream "Intruders!" over and over until Endelyn commands them to stop or until they are all destroyed. Each marionette has AC 15, 1 hit point, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Any character who has interacted with korreds can tell that the marionettes are strung with iron wires made from korred hair, and any character who knows the korreds' special jig (see "Korred Dance" earlier in the chapter) can command the hair to wind itself around the marionettes' jaws, preventing them from screaming.

![[086-04-012.endelyns-room.png|right|300]]

***Glass-Doored Wardrobe.*** The jade eye adorning the wardrobe's cornice is closed, but it opens if the wardrobe is tampered with. If Endelyn is asleep in the wardrobe when the eye opens, she awakens.

If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook and the *Story Tracker* indicates that Endelyn turned one or more of the characters' lost possessions into magic items, these objects are contained in drawers at the base of the wardrobe. (Other treasures or items might be here as well, at your discretion.)

Hanging on the back interior wall of the wardrobe is a mirror in an oval wooden frame. This mirror is similar to the magic mirror in area D1 of Bavlorna's cottage (see chapter 2).

***Hourglasses.*** The one hundred hourglasses in Endelyn's collection are worth 25 gp each. No two are exactly alike. The smallest ones are 3 inches tall, and the largest ones stand 3 feet tall. When an hourglass runs out, the device pivots around its center, allowing the sand to trickle down again. A character who uses thieves' tools or tinker's tools can remove an hourglass from its wall fixture with 1 minute of work.

***Treasure Chest.*** This chest has a sturdy, built-in lock. Endelyn lost the key, but one of her goblin workers recently found and hid it (see area M4). The chest weighs 25 pounds and holds the following:

- A black sack containing four gold bedpost knobs (25 gp each)
- Eight bottles of exquisite elven wine (100 gp each)
- The shriveled hand of an elf wearing a *ring of shooting stars* on its third finger and clutching several rolled-up sheets of blank parchment, along with a title page that reads, "The Agonies of **Alagarthas**: A Three-Act Tragedy by **Endelyn Moongrave**" in spidery Elvish script. (Endelyn hasn't written the script yet, but she has a title.)

***Wicker Basket and Toys.*** The wicker basket belonged to Endelyn's missing cat, **Gloam**, which the characters might have found in chapter 2. Harmless cat toys (three tiny, stuffed birds from Bavlorna and three tiny, wind-up clockwork birds from Skabatha) are strewn around the basket. A creature can use an action to wind the key on one of the clockwork birds, causing it to chirp softly and shuffle its feet. If placed on the floor, the wound-up bird walks counterclockwise in a 5-foot-diameter circle, completing one circle every 10 seconds. After walking for 30 seconds, the bird stops moving and chirping until it is wound up again.

## Leaving Yon
If Amidor is still with the characters when their business in Yon is concluded, the dandelion can lead them back to Hither, or it can guide them along a meandering route through the mountains of Yon to the foot of a bridge that arches across a misty expanse and ends at the front gate of the *Palace of Heart's Desire*. Amidor is willing to make this journey only after Gleam and Glister are reunited and borne safely to the Fey Beacons (and from there to the Witchlight Carnival).

If the characters ring the silver bell in area M20, they can travel to the palace on the backs of Zybilna's giant cranes, which swoop gracefully over the pinnacles of Yon and gently deposit the characters in the palace garden. Again, Amidor won't travel to the palace until his commitment to Gleam and Glister is fulfilled.
---
# Palace of Heart's Desire
The archfey Zybilna is known to grant wishes to mortals brave enough to visit her abode: the Palace of Heart's Desire.

Zybilna's fairytale palace sits at the heart of Prismeer. On some worlds, the archfey is seen as a fairy godmother of sorts, casting *wish* spells for the benefit of the lost, the forsaken, or the betrayed. Sometimes her wishes would bring happiness, other times despair. Her palace was a destination for anyone seeking their heart's desire.

Zybilna no longer grants wishes, for she is trapped in temporal stasis—frozen in time by the magic of her cauldron, which the hags of the Hourglass Coven have turned against her. Freeing Zybilna is the only way to repair the damage the hags have done to Prismeer, but doing so carries certain risks, for Zybilna has a dark side that she has hidden away for many years.

![[087-05-001.chapter-splash.jpg|right|300]]

## Running This Chapter
In this chapter, the characters explore the halls of Lavoglia, better known as the Palace of Heart's Desire. Most likely, they've learned of Zybilna's betrayal at the hands of the Hourglass Coven and are searching for a way to free her. The characters can undo the spell that froze Zybilna in time and learn that she is, in fact, **Iggwilv the Witch Queen**. If all goes well, they can free Zybilna and count on her help in return—perhaps even gaining a *wish* spell for their trouble.

Before your first game session in this chapter, follow these steps to help make the players' experience as entertaining as possible:

- Read the description of *Iggwilv's Cauldron* in *appendix A*.
- Read this chapter in its entirety, and reacquaint yourself with the "Rules of Conduct" and "Death in Prismeer" sections of *chapter 2*.
- Check the *Story Tracker* for any achievements that could help the characters inside the palace.

### Fall of the Witch Queen
**Iggwilv the Witch Queen** created the persona of Zybilna to hide from her most hated enemies. In the Feywild, she raised a magnificent palace and set about establishing herself as the benevolent archfey Zybilna of Prismeer, avatar of mercy for destitute mortals. Her closest allies saw the cracks in her facade, flashes of arrogance and cruelty that conflicted with her kindly persona, but they ascribed this behavior to the mercurial nature of archfey.

Over time, Iggwilv made the mistake of placing too much trust in the hags of the Hourglass Coven, who served in her court as advisors. The hags waited patiently for the opportunity to overthrow Iggwilv. That day came when the League of Malevolence arrived at the palace.

For years, the evil sorcerer **Kelek** had coveted the *staff of power* wielded by his archenemy, a good-aligned wizard named **Ringlerun**. When **Kelek** uncovered clues to Zybilna's true identity, he hatched a foolish plan to blackmail her into bringing him the staff. **Kelek** was betrayed at the eleventh hour by his own companion, the warlock **Skylla**, who secretly swore loyalty to Baba Yaga, Iggwilv's adoptive mother. When the League of Malevolence arrived at the palace, the Hourglass Coven ensured that **Kelek**'s rivals from Valor's Call were close behind. The two factions clashed inside the palace.

> ##### Iggwilv the Witch Queen
>Iggwilv has a long and storied history throughout the multiverse. This adventure presents the legendary figure in her current form. Her **stat block** appears at the end of the chapter.
>
>***Baba Yaga's Daughter.*** Iggwilv's path to greatness began when she was adopted by the mother of all witches, Baba Yaga, who named her Natasha. On the worlds of the Material Plane, she was better known as Tasha, the inventor of *Tasha's hideous laughter*. Tasha's magic-fueled ambitions brought her into contact with demons and demon lords, which she subjugated and used against her enemies. Tasha became known on the world of Oerth as **Iggwilv the Witch Queen**, a peerless wizard and conqueror. It was she who wrote the *Demonomicon of Iggwilv*—the greatest of all treatises on the Abyss and its demonic inhabitants. (The book, which plays no part in this adventure, is described in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*.)

>***Iggwilv's Transformation.*** Iggwilv learned several dark secrets while studying the Abyss, including the ability to summon demons and demonic spirits. But in her quest for absolute power, she made too many enemies and underestimated their determination to destroy her, so she fled to other worlds and across planes to escape the worst of them. She eventually took a page from her mother's book and sequestered herself in the Feywild, where she assumed the guise of an archfey and carved out a spectacular domain for herself. Gradually, Iggwilv transformed into a Fey creature, though she outwardly appears human. Her disposition changed over time as well, as she became less interested in personal power and more interested in exploring her fey existence.

While Zybilna was distracted, the hags used *Iggwilv's Cauldron* to freeze everyone but themselves in temporal stasis.

Unable to agree on who should keep the cauldron, the three hags freed the members of the League of Malevolence from temporal stasis by touching each of them with a unicorn horn, then hired them to watch over the cauldron. Not long afterward, the unicorn horn was lost.

### The League of Malevolence
The League of Malevolence is led by a human sorcerer named **Kelek**, who intends to free **Ringlerun** from temporal stasis and claim the wizard's *staff of power*. To this end, he and the other members of the league are searching Prismeer for a unicorn horn to break the spell on **Ringlerun**. See appendix B for more information on these villains.

When the characters arrive at the palace, the following members of the League of Malevolence are present:

- **Kelek** holds court in the throne room (area P31), where he is protected by a helmed swordsman named **Warduke**.
- **Zargash**, a human priest of Orcus who hopes to supplant **Kelek** as leader of the league, is usually encountered in area P30.

Two other members of the League of Malevolence can be found elsewhere in Prismeer:

- **Zarak**, an assassin, was sent to Thither to slay a unicorn named Lamorna and acquire her horn (see "Wayward Pool" in *chapter 3*).
- **Skylla**, the warlock who forged a secret pact with Baba Yaga, has sequestered herself in Motherhorn, where she has adopted the stage name of Charmay (see area M12 in *chapter 4*).

> ##### Where Shall We Three Meet Again?
>If the characters forced the hags of the Hourglass Coven to flee their lairs in chapters 2, 3, and 4, the hags retreat to area P47. When the hags are in the palace, members of the League of Malevolence act as their underlings while steering clear of the hags whenever possible.
>

### Valor's Call
Led by the human paladin **Strongheart**, the heroes of Valor's Call tracked the League of Malevolence to Prismeer. Determined to bring the league's members to justice for crimes committed on many worlds, Valor's Call met with Zybilna and tried to forge an alliance with the archfey. When the hags of the Hourglass Coven used *Iggwilv's Cauldron* to freeze Zybilna in time, several members of Valor's Call were frozen in time as well:

- **Mercion**, a human cleric, was frozen in the ballroom (area P22) alongside Zybilna. **Mercion** was in sight of the cauldron, so she witnessed the Hourglass Coven's betrayal.
- **Ringlerun**, a human wizard, was frozen in area P23 while casting a *cone of cold* spell.
- **Strongheart** was frozen just as **Warduke** blasted him through the wall of Zybilna's study (area P47). He now hovers in the air above the Court of Storms (area P13).

Two more members of Valor's Call are found elsewhere in Prismeer:

- **Elkhorn**, a dwarf fighter, was released from temporal stasis so that **Skabatha Nightshade** could interrogate him. The characters encounter **Elkhorn** in Thither (see area L13 in *chapter 3*).
- **Molliver**, a human rogue, was not in the palace when the time-freezing effect took hold. The characters encounter **Molliver** in Yon (see "Brigganock Mine" in *chapter 4*).

See appendix B for more information on these heroes.

## Arrival at the Palace
The means by which the characters travel to the palace determines where they arrive:

- Characters who make the overland journey from Yon with Amidor cross a bridge that leads straight to the palace's front gate (area P1).
- Characters who ride on the backs of giant cranes from Motherhorn are deposited in the garden (area P2).

No matter how the characters arrive at the palace, describe it as follows:

>>A twilit palace emerges dreamlike from the clouds. A great marble tower ringed by delicate spires casts its shadow over the rooftops below. Another tower teeters nearby, torn from its foundations and held aloft by a coiled beanstalk. Monstrous vines cling to the palace walls and choke the promontory of rock on which it perches.
>>

From the palace, the characters can gaze across the whole of Prismeer. You can now show your players the poster map of the domain. Once the characters view Prismeer from the palace, they can travel between Hither, Thither, or Yon without guides and can find their way to any location marked on the poster map.

As the characters survey their surroundings, the **jabberwock** (see *appendix C*) returns from a hunt in Thither:

>>Hundreds of birds burst from the canopy of the ancient forest below you and scatter in all directions. Moments later, a much more fearsome creature erupts from the woods: a sinewy, pale-green dragon that takes to the sky and flies toward the palace. Its mighty wings carry it to great heights. Once above the palace, it drops like a stone and vanishes from sight behind the palace's high walls.
>>

The jabberwock has fed and is tired. It returns to its lair in the ballroom (area P22), entering the palace through a hole in the wall of the bathing room (area P25) and ignoring the characters.

### Friends and Followers
In their travels through Hither, Thither, and Yon, the characters might have gained a follower or three. Likely companions include the three guides (**Clapperclaw the scarecrow**, **Squirt the oilcan**, and **Amidor the dandelion**), but others are possible. Running this chapter will be much easier if you encourage the player characters to explore the palace on their own, leaving any friends and followers outside the front gate or in the palace garden. These friends and followers, justifiably afraid that the palace will make mincemeat out of them, encourage the characters to explore the palace without them.

By the time the characters reach the palace, they might have learned one or more of the following facts, which you can gently reiterate to discourage the characters from allowing others to follow them into the palace:

- Zybilna's dragon (the jabberwock) haunts the palace. Only the bravest and hardiest adventurers stand a chance of surviving an encounter with it.
- There are likely to be magical wards throughout the palace—some placed by Zybilna, others by the Hourglass Coven.
- The League of Malevolence occupies the palace, and three of its members are still unaccounted for.

Two members of Valor's Call are noteworthy exceptions. If **Elkhorn** and **Molliver** are with the party, they insist on accompanying the characters into the palace to make sure the other members of Valor's Call are all right.

## Exploring the Palace
The palace has more than a few recurring physical features, not the least of which are creatures and objects frozen in time by the Hourglass Coven and *Iggwilv's Cauldron*.

### Palace Features
The sky above the palace is always filled with the orange and purple hues of twilight. The walls, ceilings, and floors inside the palace are made of dressed marble unless the text states otherwise. The ceilings throughout the palace are 30 feet high and arched. Climbing gear or magic is needed to scale the palace walls, inside or out.

![[088-05-002.crown-locked-door.png|right|300]]

Magical wards on all the windows and many of the doors render them immune to all damage and their locks impossible to pick, although a *knock* spell or similar magic opens a locked window or door. Assume a door is unlocked and a window is locked unless the text states otherwise.

#### Crown Locks
Most of the locked doors in the palace can be unlocked by placing the crown from the maiden's pond (area P8) on the head of either the iron lion in area P9 or the iron hart in area P10. It is assumed that the characters will revisit areas P9 and P10 from time to time so that they can toggle the locks to provide entry where they want to go. Once opened, a crown-locked door can be propped open to keep it from locking again when the crown is removed from the head of the lion or the hart. A crown-locked door can also be opened with a *knock* spell.

The maps of the palace use the following symbols to denote these locked doors:

![[089-05-011.lion-crown.png|right|300]]

This symbol denotes a lion crown lock, which can be unlocked by placing the crown on the head of the iron lion in area P9.

![[090-05-012.hart-crown.png|right|300]]

This symbol denotes a hart crown lock, which can be unlocked by placing the crown on the head of the iron hart in area P10.

A marble cameo depicting a lion or a hart wearing a crown is mounted above each magically locked door, identifying which iron guardian must wear the crown for it to be unlocked.

Creatures whose names have been penned inside Zybilna's ritual book (see area P49) can open locked doors in the palace without using the crown. This is how the members of the Hourglass Coven and the League of Malevolence are able to move through the palace unhindered.

### Temporal Stasis
Many creatures and objects throughout the palace are trapped in temporal stasis—frozen in time, in other words.

Creatures in temporal stasis, as well as anything they are carrying or wearing, can't be harmed or moved until the magic on them is ended. Various unattended objects, magical effects, and other natural phenomena throughout the palace are also frozen in time; for example, motes of dust hang motionless in the air, flames stand perfectly still, and food remains unspoiled.

#### Ending the Effect on Creatures
One can use an action to end the time-freezing magic on a creature by touching it with a unicorn horn while speaking the creature's true name. (Nicknames and aliases won't work.) Zybilna's faithful butler, **Thinnings** (see area P15), learned this fact after spying on the hags, and he shares this knowledge with characters who befriend him.

#### Unattended Objects Frozen in Time
A unicorn horn has no effect on objects frozen in time that aren't being worn or carried. Unlike creatures in temporal stasis, unattended objects that are frozen in time can be manipulated, moved, damaged, and destroyed; a time-frozen apple is just as juicy as it was before being frozen, and time-frozen fire still deals damage and can be snuffed out by pouring water over it.

### Lower Palace Locations
The following locations are keyed to the maps of the palace. If the characters explore one or more of these locations after ending the time-freezing effect on the palace, modify the descriptions of these locations as needed to account for this change.

![[092-map-5.1-palace-lower-player.jpg|right|300]]
#### P1. Front Gate

>>Ivy clings to a set of silvery gates embedded in the palace's outer wall. A luxuriant garden can be seen beyond the bars of the gates.
>>

The double gate is 20 feet tall and pushes open with ease. Its silver-plated iron bars are spaced wide enough for Small humanoids to squeeze through. The wall encircling the garden is 40 feet high and is easily climbed due to the vegetation clinging to it.

***Concealed Inscription.*** Characters who search the gate for traps don't find any, but they do notice a small bronze plaque embedded in a flagstone at the base of the gate. The plaque bears an inscription in Elvish that provides a hint about unlocking the crown locks inside the palace (see "Crown Locks" above). The inscription reads:

>*The lion or the hart must wear the crown.*
>
>*But which one should it weigh down?*
>

#### P2. Palace Garden

>>The scents of roses, cowslips, and hyacinths suffuse this vast garden. Ahead, a ring of standing stones rises from the flower beds. Glittering streams divide the garden and connect with a large pond shaded by willows. The garden is silent save for the sounds of music and voices coming from a colorful pavilion by the front gate.
>>

This garden encompasses several other locations (areas P3 through P8) and is lush with flower beds, trees, and topiaries. The streams are 2 feet deep and easily forded.

Minor damage to the garden is tolerated, but widespread destruction causes the iron lion in area P9 and the iron hart in area P10 to burst out of their towers and attack those responsible.

***Frozen Features.*** Characters who explore the garden notice that its features and most of its occupants (except for some of the guests in the pavilion and the ettercaps in the rose garden) are frozen in time. Pixies are suspended in midflight or frozen mid-frolic in the stream, the waters of which are perfectly still. Forest gnome gardeners stand rigidly in flower beds, time-frozen water issuing from their tipped wooden watering cans, or atop small ladders, taking shears to topiaries in need of trimming. Bees and pollen hang motionless in the air.

***Fruit Trees.*** Many of the trees in the garden bear glittering gold and silver fruit. A *detect magic* spell reveals auras of divination magic around the gold fruit and auras of abjuration magic around the silver fruit.

A creature that eats more than half of a gold-skinned fruit gains advantage on Wisdom saving throws for 24 hours, but this benefit ends on the creature if it eats a silver-skinned fruit. A creature that eats more than half of a silver-skinned fruit gains 10 temporary hit points, which go away if the creature eats a gold-skinned fruit. Once it is plucked from the branch, a golden or silver fruit spoils after 10 minutes and loses its magical property.

***Streams.*** Two streams flow into the pool at area P8—or, rather, they used to flow before they were frozen in time. The streams emerge from culverts in the garden walls, but where the water comes from is anyone's guess. (It is created magically and disappears magically before it can cause the pool to overflow.) The time-frozen water, which has the consistency of soft dough, takes on the qualities of normal water if removed from either stream or the pool.

#### P3. Pavilion
The entrance to the pavilion is open, and music and voices come from inside the place. If one or more characters look inside, read:

>>Seven guests—one of them a talking bear—lounge around a picnic table covered with an emerald-green cloth and laden with cakes, teapots, teacups, and cutlery. Two of the guests are motionless and silent, but the others are engaged in spirited conversation. At the back of the pavilion, a string quartet of badger minstrels plays delicate chamber music.
>>

The guests gathered here are denizens of the Material Plane who regard Zybilna as a fairy godmother-like figure. After using various fey crossings to enter the Feywild, they petitioned spellcasters to transport them to the palace, arriving in the ring of standing stones (area P4). They had hoped to receive audiences with Zybilna upon their arrival but have been told to wait in the garden until meetings can be arranged with her representatives (the sisters of the Hourglass Coven). The guests are unaware of Zybilna's current predicament and have lost track of time.

The guests include these individuals:

- Sumai, a farmer (lawful good, male, human **commoner**) from the world of Toril, carries a carnivorous pumpkin named Yamzu (an **awakened shrub** that speaks Common, with a Bite attack identical to the shrub's Rake attack except it deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage). Sumai wants Yamzu to stop devouring his livestock, but he doesn't want to harm the pumpkin.
- Lord Eld, a faultlessly polite aristocrat (chaotic good, male, high elf **noble**) from the world of Oerth, was transformed into a living statue by wild magic emanating from a family crypt. He wants the effect to be undone and to be restored to his true form. While in this form, he has resistance to all damage, but his speed is halved.
- Obal Obb, a headless dwarf (lawful good, male, mountain dwarf **commoner**) hailing from the world of Oerth, is searching for his missing head, which was stolen. The magic that deprived Obal of his head left him blinded but, miraculously, he can hear just fine. He stomps his foot once to communicate "yes," and twice for "no."
- Bodger, a **brown bear** from a world of your choice, hopes to undo a curse put on him by a cruel river spirit who resented him eating its fish. Thanks to the *awaken* spell that was cast on him by a friendly druid, Bodger has an Intelligence of 10 and speaks Common.
- Majera d'Valzey (neutral, female, human **noble**) from the world of Eberron, has a magic quill named Dictado. The quill scrawls out anything Majera says, and her place at the table is piled with sheets of parchment. Majera is hoping to break the terms of an arranged marriage.

Two other guests were present when the Hourglass Coven froze the palace in time: Hogus Pinsworth (lawful good, male, strongheart halfling **commoner**) from the world of Tal'dorei, who needs help paying off his debts, and Zurrash (chaotic good, female **orc war chief**) from the world of Eberron, who was ousted by one of her rivals. Both are trapped in temporal stasis, and none of the other pavilion guests know who they are.

When the characters arrive, the five guests who aren't frozen in time are having an animated conversation about whether clotted cream should be applied to a scone before or after jam. They are so engrossed in this debate that they fail to acknowledge the presence of newcomers unless a character enters the discussion or taps on a teacup loudly with a spoon (which the guests sometimes do when seeking attention).

If questioned, the guests reveal that they arrived at the palace separately and each of them is waiting to speak to one or more of Zybilna's representatives. They've been here a long time (how long they aren't sure exactly), yet they remain patient and well fed. The guests have wandered the garden but can offer no information about the palace. They know better than to enter the palace without an invitation.

***Badger Minstrels.*** Each of these four **badgers** received one of **Skabatha Nightshade**'s *awaken* spells, which granted it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common. **Bavlorna Blightstraw** crafted instruments for the badgers, and **Endelyn Moongrave** taught them how to play their instruments. They now have proficiency in the Performance skill.

The hags have instructed the badgers to entertain visitors and discourage them from entering the palace until the Hourglass Coven gets around to striking bargains with them. The badgers proudly declare their allegiance to the hags, saying, "What fine ladies they are. Their names should be Sweetness, Kindness, and Charity, for all the good they do!" (The badgers aren't evil, just misguided.)

***Tea and Cakes.*** The pavilion's supply of tea and cakes magically replenishes every hour. The cakes are delicious. Any cakes removed from the pavilion instantly become moldy.

***Treasure.*** Characters who freed **Sir Talavar** in chapter 2 find a wrapped present on the table, with their names written on the tag. None of the guests has been rude enough to open it. Inside, the characters find a *chime of opening*, along with a note that reads in Draconic, "Many thanks! May fortune smile on you. Yours, **Sir Talavar**."

#### P4. Standing Stones

>>Twelve moss-covered standing stones form a ring in the middle of a small clearing. An arcane sigil is inscribed on the inward-facing side of each stone, and the space between the stones is free of vegetation.
>>

A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the standing stones. Any character who examines the sigils on the stones and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can determine that they combine into a sequence that allows the ring of standing stones to function as a teleportation circle. A character who has this sequence written down or committed to memory can use it in conjunction with the *teleportation circle* spell to arrive inside the ring, provided the spell is cast somewhere in the Feywild.

#### P5. Fountain of Awakening

>>A marble fountain rises from a plinth on the bank of the stream, overflowing with time-frozen water that spills from the mouths of sculpted animals. The frozen spray surrounding the fountain creates rainbows in the air around it.
>>

A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the fountain. The magic of this fountain still functions even though its waters are frozen in time. The water can be handled and made to hold new forms as if it were soft dough, but any water removed from the fountain takes on the consistency of normal water. Any Beast that bathes in the fountain's still waters is awakened, as if by the *awaken* spell, provided it meets the spell's requirements. The effect ends if the awakened Beast leaves the palace garden.

Any Humanoid that drinks from the fountain or bathes in its waters must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, its Intelligence score drops to 3 for 24 hours, and it gains the following flaw, which supersedes any conflicting trait: "I have the disposition of a wild animal." Any magic that ends a curse ends the effect on the creature immediately.

#### P6. Woodcutter's Axe

>>A gleaming greataxe is embedded in a withered tree stump near a bend in the stream.
>>

***Treasure.*** The greataxe is a *woodcutter's axe* (see *appendix A*). Only a creature that has a Strength score of 18 or higher can remove it from the stump.

#### P7. Rose Garden

>>This fragrant rose garden is bordered by a bronze fence. The roses come in a variety of colors, with a few white and black specimens among them. Glistening spiderwebs cover the rosebushes.
>>

The webs belong to three **ettercaps** that recently crawled up from the forest of Thither. They lurk under the soil, waiting patiently for tasty fairies to get stuck in their webs. If one or more characters enter the rose garden, the ettercaps rise from their earthy cysts and assume threatening postures, hoping to scare off the characters. The ettercaps lack the courage to fight anything bigger than a pixie, but they defend themselves if attacked. An ettercap reduced to 22 hit points or fewer tries to flee by crawling up and over the nearby palace wall.

***Chromatic Roses.*** Any character who explores the rose garden spots a magic rosebush growing near its center:

>>In the heart of the rose garden, coiled around a statue of a prancing satyr holding a set of pipes to his lips, is a thorny vine with five roses growing out of it, each one a different color: black, blue, green, red, and white.
>>

The vine has five *chromatic roses* (see *appendix A*). If all five roses are picked, the vine withers and dies.

***Statue.*** The statue is a petrified **satyr** named Xinipax. If the petrified condition is ended on him, Xinipax plays a whimsical tune on his pipes and offers his rescuers a gift in return. He gallops to the nearby stream, pulls a wineskin from its shallow depths, guzzles down its contents, and hands the empty wineskin to his rescuers. Xinipax believes the wineskin can turn water into the finest elven wine, but he is mistaken. The satyr is cursed with the inability to tell water from wine, and the wineskin is nonmagical. Even if his claim is proven false, Xinipax still regards the wineskin as a worthy gift.

Xinipax doesn't know what turned him to stone or how long he was petrified. After bestowing his gift, he gallops around the garden, playing his pipes and making a general nuisance of himself. He has no useful information about the palace or its other inhabitants.

#### P8. Maiden's Pond

>>Willow trees encircle this sheltered pond. Lily pads dot the mirror-like surface of the water, and hungry dragonflies dart about, feeding on motionless fireflies that form an unmoving cloud above the still water.
>>

The lake, the trees, and the fireflies are frozen in time, but the dragonflies are not. The pool's time-frozen water can be handled and made to hold new forms as if it were soft dough, but any water removed from the pool takes on the consistency of normal water.

If one or more characters touch the pool, read:

>>A delicate hand made of water, black as winter's night, silently breaks the water's surface. The hand clutches a crown made of silver needles. Below the hand, under the surface, a school of shimmering black fish takes on a vaguely humanoid form.
>>

A fey spirit is bound to the lake. Underwater, its body has the shape of a school of fish. Its watery hand holds the crown aloft until a character takes it or the party moves away, at which point the hand slips back under the water. If the crown isn't taken from the hand, it can be retrieved from the bottom of the lake, which is 10 feet deep.

***Taking the Crown.*** Its sharp needles make the crown difficult to handle without gloves or gauntlets. The pricking of the needles isn't severe enough to deal damage, but a character can't grasp the crown with bare hands for longer than 1 minute before the discomfort becomes unbearable.

A character who holds the crown hears a gentle voice on the wind. In a language the character understands, the voice says:

>*The beginning of Whenever*
>
>*The end of Ever After*
>
>*The start of an Age*
>
>*The finale of every Moment*
>
>*The first in History*
>

Arranging the indicated letters of the key words on each line in sequence spells out the word "Wrath" (for example, the first letter of "Whenever" is W, the last letter of "Ever" and "After" is R, and so forth). The riddle hints that the crown should first be placed on the brow of Wrath, the iron hart (see area P10).

#### P9. Envy's Tower
The base of this tower is 10 feet higher than the garden floor. Stairs hugging the tower's outer wall climb 10 feet to an unlocked double door. A bronze plaque above the door reads "**Envy**" in Common. The tower is 30 feet tall and has no roof, enabling characters to enter it from above if they have the means to do so.

>>Oak trees fill much of the interior of this tower. Rays of light cut through the canopy, illuminating a marble pedestal that stands at ground level, swathed in tree roots. A hulking lion seemingly made of iron stands on the pedestal, flicking its tail in irritation. "You can call us **Envy**," it says.
>>

![[093-05-003.envy-the-iron-lion.png|right|300]]

The iron lion, **Envy**, is one of two guardians that Zybilna created to watch over her garden in her absence. When Zybilna became frozen in time, her guardians appeared from their respective demiplanes to perform their duty. **Envy** uses the **gorgon** stat block, with these changes:

- The iron lion speaks Common and Sylvan, referring to itself using the pronouns "we" and "us."
- It has a Bite attack instead of a Gore attack, and it has a Claws attack that deals slashing damage instead of a Hooves attack that deals bludgeoning damage. (The attacks are functionally the same otherwise.)

**Envy** dislikes its counterpart, Wrath (see area P10), but the two are prevented by Zybilna's magic from harming one another. When the characters first grace the iron lion with their presence, it demands their obeisance and commands them to kneel before it. If the characters do as **Envy** commands, the lion is pleased and allows them to remain in its presence. Characters who fail to show it deference are instructed to leave the tower at once, and the lion attacks those who refuse.

The lion shares the following information with characters who show it proper respect:

- "We and our counterpart were created as a pair to protect the gardens from intruders in Zybilna's absence."
- "Our presence here means that our mistress is gone. Where? We do not know."
- "The palace receives visitors even in Zybilna's absence. Guests are to remain in the garden pavilion until Zybilna deigns to grant them an audience. It is not our responsibility to protect visitors."

Characters on good terms with **Envy** can ask it about the crown of needles from area P8. It knows the following information about the crown:

- "Zybilna created the crown as a key that guests can use to reach certain areas of the palace in her absence. The crown has two forms: one made of silver needles, the other of golden roses."
- "To transform the crown of needles into its gold form, it must be placed on the brow of the correct iron guardian. Which of us, **Envy** or Wrath, is the correct guardian? We cannot say. Placing the crown on the incorrect guardian banishes the guardian to its demiplane, along with the crown."
- "Once the crown is transformed into its gold form, either guardian can wear it without being banished. Certain doors inside the palace become unlocked or locked, depending on which guardian wears the golden crown." (Neither **Envy** nor Wrath knows which doors in the palace each of them is connected to.)

To transform the crown of silver needles into the crown of golden roses, it must be placed on Wrath's brow, but **Envy** doesn't know that. If the crown of silver needles is placed on **Envy**'s head, **Envy** is banished to its demiplane along with the crown until Zybilna wills them both to return (which can't happen while she's trapped in temporal stasis).

In its gold form, the crown can be safely placed on **Envy**'s head, even if the iron lion is dead. While **Envy** wears the crown, all lion-marked doors throughout the palace become unlocked (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

**Envy** is willing to let the characters take the crown from it temporarily, but it wants something in exchange each time it relinquishes the crown: a lei made from flowers found in the palace garden (area P2). A single character needs 1 hour to pick the flowers and fashion the lei, but multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. The lei must be presented to **Envy** as a gift and draped over its shoulders. To determine whether **Envy** is satisfied, each character who contributed to the necklace's creation can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. On a successful check, the lei is deemed acceptable, and **Envy** relinquishes the crown. If any character's check total is 25 or higher, the lei is deemed extraordinary, and from that point on, **Envy** relinquishes the crown whenever the characters ask for it.

#### P10. Wrath's Tower
The base of this tower is 10 feet higher than the garden floor. The double door to this tower is accessible from a 10-foot-high stone catwalk that connects it with the servants' quarters (area P15). A bronze plaque above the door bears the word "Wrath" in Common. The tower is 30 feet tall and has no roof, enabling characters to enter it from above if they have the means to do so.

>>This tower is filled with hawthorns. At the heart of the thicket, a hart seemingly made from iron stands atop a marble pedestal, pawing the ground angrily. Strewn around the pedestal are a dozen empty baskets.
>>
>>"We are Wrath," says the iron hart.
>>

The iron hart, Wrath, is the counterpart to the iron lion named **Envy** in area P9. Wrath uses the **gorgon** stat block. It can speak Common and Sylvan, and it refers to itself using the pronouns "we" and "us."

Wrath dislikes **Envy**, but the two are prevented by Zybilna's magic from harming one another. When the characters first appear before the iron hart, it demands their obeisance and commands them to kneel before it. If the characters do as Wrath commands, the hart is pleased and allows them to remain in its presence. Characters who fail to show it deference are instructed to leave the tower at once, and Wrath attacks those who refuse. Wrath knows the same information that **Envy** knows (see area P9).

To transform the crown of silver needles from area P8 into the crown of golden roses, it must be placed on Wrath's brow, but Wrath doesn't know that. While Wrath wears the gold crown, all hart-marked doors in the palace are unlocked (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter). This holds true even if the iron hart is dead.

Wrath is willing to let the characters take the crown from it temporarily, but it wants something in exchange each time it relinquishes the crown: a basket of berries picked from the palace garden (area P2). If they so desire, the characters can take one of the baskets from the tower and use it to collect the berries. A single character needs 1 hour to pick the berries, but multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. The berries must be presented to Wrath as a gift, whereupon the iron hart devours them. To determine whether Wrath is satisfied, each character who picked any of them can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. On a successful check, the berry selection is deemed acceptable, and Wrath relinquishes the crown. If any character's check total is 25 or higher, the berry selection is deemed extraordinary, and from that point on, Wrath relinquishes the crown whenever the characters ask for it.

#### P11. Carriage House
When the characters open one of the doors leading to this chamber and peer inside, read:

>>The doors swing open to reveal a crystal carriage hitched to a pair of glass statues shaped like pegasi. Folded silk butterfly wings are attached to the roof of the carriage.
>>

Zybilna used this flying carriage to travel to other locations in the Feywild. The carriage's doors are sealed shut, with no handles, hinges, or keyholes. Zybilna kept the carriage's magic key inside the vehicle and used *misty step* spells to retrieve it as needed. The carriage's crystal structure is mostly opaque except for its windows. Anyone who looks through a carriage window spots an ornate glass key resting on the seat inside. To reach the key, a character must smash a window or use magic. Characters who smash their way into the carriage alert **Zargash** (see area P30), who investigates the noise.

The carriage is a Huge object with AC 13, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Its windows and wheels are separate objects, each with AC 13, 10 hit points, and the same vulnerability and immunities as the rest of the carriage. Five Medium or smaller creatures can fit comfortably inside the cab, with an additional seat up front for the driver.

If the key is held within 3 inches of the door on either side of the carriage, a keyhole magically appears on the door's surface. Turning the key clockwise in the keyhole unlocks both carriage doors and animates the **glass pegasi**, causing them to stamp their hooves impatiently. They use the **pegasus** stat block, with these changes:

- The glass pegasi are Constructs with immunity to exhaustion and the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, and petrified conditions.
- They have AC 15 while animated and AC 13 otherwise.

While the glass pegasi are animated, reins made of starlight appear in the hands of anyone who sits on the driver's seat, allowing that individual to steer the carriage. The pegasi can pull the carriage at a speed of 40 feet on land or 80 feet while flying.

Turning the key counterclockwise in either door's lock can be done only while the carriage is on the ground and not moving; doing so locks both doors and causes the pegasi to revert to inanimate glass statues.

***Development.*** Characters can use the carriage to travel beyond Prismeer to other locations in the Feywild, but the carriage and its glass pegasi shatter if the vehicle leaves the Feywild.

#### P12. Hall of Stars
The double door on the south side of this area is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>The walls of this hall are illustrated with painted panels depicting a starry sky. The paintings show what a viewer would see while looking out through a set of windows into a clear, moonless night.
>>

There is nothing peculiar about the panels.

The two doors on the north wall open onto stone balconies that overlook a stormy void (area P13) and offer clear views of the tower and the staircases suspended above it.

#### P13. Court of Storms
The double door on the stone balcony between this area and area P22 is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter). The balcony doors that adjoin areas P11, P12, P15, and P29 are not locked.

>>This rectangular courtyard is open to the twilit sky. It has no visible floor; instead, a vortex of dark clouds churns below. A marble tower rising from the maelstrom is encircled by seven turrets. Four stone staircases extend from the outer areas of the palace to the tower, each one part of a buttress that spans the void and stabilizes the tower.
>>

If the characters are in a location where they can see the hole in the wall of area P47 on the tower's second floor, add:

>>Part of the tower wall has exploded outward, and its stony fragments are hanging in the air as though time around them has stopped. Among the debris, suspended above the stormy vortex, is an armored knight with a sword in one hand and a shield on his other arm. He looks like he was thrown backward through the exploding wall before being frozen in place.
>>

The knight suspended in the air is **Strongheart** (see area P47), the leader of Valor's Call. It's obvious to anyone who can see him that the knight will plunge into the vortex if the time-freezing effect on him is ended.

***Storm Vortex.*** The vortex that churns below the central spire is not part of the palace and wasn't frozen in time. Although the storm is magical, it can't be dispelled, and the area it occupies is heavily obscured.

Any creature that falls into the vortex takes 18 (4d8) force damage. In addition, its speed becomes 0 feet, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it can't be seen by others. The creature takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns until it escapes the vortex. Any creature that ends its turn in the vortex with 0 hit points is ripped to shreds, and its remains are scattered across the planes of existence along with anything it was wearing or carrying.

Any creature that falls into the vortex has little chance of surviving. If someone throws one end of a rope into its space, the creature can grab hold of it and be pulled out.

#### P14. Spiral Staircases
Areas P14a through P14d are on the palace's lower level, while areas P14e through P14h are on the upper level. All eight rooms have similar decor:

>>The walls of this circular chamber are decorated with sculpted reliefs depicting humans and demons partaking in grotesque revels. A spiral staircase with a golden handrail is in the middle of the room.
>>

The reliefs hint at Zybilna's fondness for demons. Specifics about each room are provided below:

- **P14a** The spiral staircase ascends 30 feet to area P14e. To the northeast, an elevated staircase extends over part of the Court of Storms (area P13) and leads to one of the turrets of the central tower (area P48g on the upper level).
- **P14b** The spiral staircase ascends 30 feet to area P14f. To the northwest, an elevated staircase extends over part of the Court of Storms (area P13) and leads to one of the turrets of the central tower (area P48b on the upper level).
- **P14c** The spiral staircase ascends 30 feet to area P14g. The double door leading to the ballroom (area P22) is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).
- **P14d** The spiral staircase ascends 30 feet to area P14h. The double door leading to the ballroom (area P22) is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).
- **P14e** The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area P14a. A double door leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the palace garden (area P2).
- **P14f** The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area P14b. A double door leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the palace garden (area P2).
- **P14g** The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area P14c. A double door leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the Court of Storms (area P13).
- **P14h** The spiral staircase descends 30 feet to area P14d. A double door leads to a stone balcony that overlooks the Court of Storms (area P13). Floating 10 feet above the top of the staircase is a **banshee** trapped in temporal stasis. The banshee is all that remains of a vainglorious elf queen named Pari Astarabad, who challenged Zybilna for control of Prismeer and paid the ultimate price. The banshee is condemned to haunt this tower and, thanks to Zybilna's magic, can't leave it. If freed from temporal stasis, the banshee can move between this area and area P14d, but nowhere else.

#### P15. Servants' Quarters

>>This candlelit workroom contains tables, dressers, and bunks for the palace staff. Five goblins are frozen in place like statues, caught in the mundane chores of ironing clothes, darning socks, and folding sheets. A row of brass bells is mounted on one wall.
>>

The five goblins (unarmed, chaotic good noncombatants loyal to Zybilna) are frozen in time. The bells on the wall ring whenever occupants of the guest wing (areas P40a through P40e) tug on the bell pulls in their rooms.

***Butler.*** Zybilna's butler, **Thinnings** (neutral), lurks in this room. **Thinnings** was away on an errand when the palace was frozen in time. Since his return, he has been spying on the members of the League of Malevolence.

![[094-05-004.thinnings.png|right|300]]

**Thinnings** can be encountered anywhere inside the palace but returns to this room to rest. He has the statistics of a **spy**, except he is a Fey who speaks Common, Elvish, and Sylvan. He appears as a stick-thin man dressed in a brown dress coat, stockings, and buckled shoes. As an action, **Thinnings** can make himself as flat as a piece of parchment or revert to his normal thickness. In his flattened form, he can slide under doors, roll himself up, or even fold himself into the pages of a book.

The butler knows the palace's layout and defenses, but he's not inclined to share information with strangers. As soon as he hears a door to this room being opened, **Thinnings** ducks into the narrow space under or behind one of the dressers. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher notice **Thinnings** as they casually survey the room; a thorough search of the room finds him automatically. **Thinnings**, who has no reason to trust the characters, refuses to emerge from his hiding place. A character can earn the butler's trust and coax him out by reciting Demitasse's rhyme (see area P19) and then sharing a secret with him. (Any old fact will do, as long as he doesn't know it already.) If his trust is earned or the characters capture him, **Thinnings** shares the following information:

- After using Zybilna's cauldron to neutralize the archfey and most of her court, the hags of the Hourglass Coven left the League of Malevolence in the palace to guard the cauldron. Only three members of the league—**Kelek**, **Warduke**, and **Zargash**—are in the palace presently.
- Years ago, Zybilna befriended a jabberwock and trained it to drink from her cauldron. It still frequents the palace and loiters around the cauldron, making it impossible for **Kelek** and the others to guard the cauldron effectively. The only creature in the palace that stands a chance in a fight against the jabberwock is Zybilna's great owl, Bloodybeak, which is kept in the aviary (area P20).
- To free a creature frozen in time, one must touch it with a unicorn horn while speaking the creature's true name. (**Thinnings** knows that "Zybilna" is not Zybilna's true name. He thinks her true name is Iggwilv, but it's not.) The League of Malevolence is searching Prismeer for a unicorn horn so that **Kelek** can free **Ringlerun**, his archenemy, from temporal stasis and steal his *staff of power*.

*Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for **Thinnings**.

***Treasure.*** The bottom drawer of **Thinnings**'s dresser contains the butler's collection of rings. Many of the rings are rewards from Zybilna for faithful service, and others were gifted to him by guests who learned about his obsession. The collection includes the following:

- Sixty-one ornate silver rings (10 gp each)
- Thirty ornate gold rings (25 gp each)
- An onyx ring (50 gp) that radiates an aura of illusion magic under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell (when worn, the ring creates illusory butterflies that flutter around the wearer)

#### P16. Palace Kitchen

>>An eight-foot-tall, three-foot-diameter, multitiered cake rests on a large round table in this kitchen, which also contains a stove and an assortment of mismatched cupboards and worktables. Eight pixies are suspended in midair around the cake, each wearing a chef's hat and a flour-stained apron. Six of the pixies squeeze cloth tubes that have icing coming out of them. The other two hold armfuls of tiny crimson candles.
>>
>>Thick creepers with broad leaves encroach on the kitchen through a partially open door in the middle of a concave wall. The roots stretch across the floor and coil around the large table, but not around a smaller, rectangular wheeled table that has three trussed-up giant rats on it.
>>

The eight **pixies** work for Zybilna as bakers, and they are frozen in time. In addition to the large cake described below, characters can see platters of blue-frosted cupcakes and candied apples on sticks, bowls of sugar-glazed button mushrooms, and bottles of eveningberry wine (a sweet, nonalcoholic drink).

***Cake.*** This perfectly preserved cake was made for Zybilna's birthday. Made of cream, sponge, fruit, and white icing, the cake has eight tiers and weighs 100 pounds. If the characters want to move the cake safely, they can transfer it to the wheeled table.

***Wheeled Table.*** Three **giant rats**, frozen in time, lie atop the small table. The rats are meant to be fed to Bloodybeak, the great owl in area P20.

#### P17. Base of the Beanstalk
An open doorway leading from the kitchen (area P16) has thick creepers spreading through it.

>>Here, the palace has been torn asunder by the growth of an enormous beanstalk that has lifted one of its towers high into the air. The space beyond the open doorway is choked with rubble and the thick roots that form the beanstalk's base.
>>

The tower above is area P51. Zybilna's quasit, Iggrik, used a potion from his mistress's laboratory (area P42) to grow the beanstalk and cause the tower to be lifted to its present height.

The beanstalk is 80 feet high, elevating the floor of the tower 20 feet above the palace roof. A creature that can fly can reach the tower easily enough. A creature can climb the beanstalk without needing magic or climbing gear, but doing so requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. On a check that fails by 5 or more, the creature falls.

The beanstalk has AC 15 and is impervious to most forms of damage. If it is struck with the *woodcutter's axe* (see area P6), the beanstalk shrinks 5 feet for every hit point of damage the weapon deals. If the beanstalk takes enough damage to reduce its height to 50 feet, the tower drops to its original position (so that the floor of area P51 is level with the second floor of the palace), and the beanstalk dies.

#### P18. Banquet Hall

>>Paintings of fey creatures and the mounted heads of majestic elk with golden horns decorate the walls of this dining hall. In the middle of the hall, a deformed giant squats at the head of a table piled with food. The grease-stained tablecloth is tucked under the giant's chin, and she washes down each slobbering mouthful of food with a gulp from a barrel of beer.
>>
>>A tea cart in one corner of the banquet hall has an iron kettle and a tureen of steaming soup resting on doilies atop it.
>>

The balcony extends out over the western part of this chamber, as indicated by the dashed line on the map. See area P32 for more information about the balcony.

![[095-05-005.dubhforgail.png|right|300]]

Dubhforgail, the gluttonous **fomorian**, intends to conquer Prismeer. Three days ago, she scaled the column of rock atop which the palace is perched and entered through a hole in the wall (see area P25). **Kelek** used every ounce of his charisma to lure Dubhforgail into the banquet hall, hoping to keep her out of his way until the Hourglass Coven can deal with her. Dubhforgail has eaten nearly all the palace's food, yet her appetite remains insatiable. She has no regard for the rules of conduct (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*).

Dubhforgail assumes the characters are **Kelek**'s minions and demands that they bring her the cake that **Kelek** promised her ("Eight tiers high, lit with blood-red candles, and icing white as snow"). She warns them that if they leave and return without it, she'll gobble them up instead "to see if you taste as sweet as you look." Dubhforgail is wicked and violent; if the characters anger her now or later, she snatches up her club and attacks. If treated to the cake from area P16, Dubhforgail settles down to eat it over the next 3 hours. During this time, characters can move freely through the banquet hall without angering the fomorian.

***Tea Cart.*** The tea cart's drawers contain utensils, candlesticks, teacups, saucers, bowls, and napkins. The cart and its contents animate whenever someone sits at a table on the terrace (see area P19 for details).

#### P19. Dining Terrace

>>Bathed in twilight, this marble terrace offers a stunning view of the mountains, forests, swamps, and shimmering horizons of Prismeer. Spaced about the balcony are tables draped in white tablecloths with chairs set around each one.
>>

If one or more characters take seats at a table, read:

>>The tea cart from the banquet hall rolls onto the terrace and careens over to your table. Cups, saucers, bowls, utensils, and napkins fly out of the cart's drawers and arrange themselves before you. They are joined by a waddling cauldron of soup, a piping-hot tea kettle, and a pair of lit candles in candlesticks. A serving spoon hops onto the cart, bows, and says in Common, "I am Demitasse, your head waiter. I believe a light supper of tea and soup is in order."
>>

Magic similar to an *animate objects* spell makes the cart and its collection of objects act as described. The kettle and the cauldron never run out of tea and hot soup, provided they remain inside the palace grounds.

A creature that drinks both the tea and the soup gains 10 temporary hit points—a benefit each creature can gain only once every 24 hours.

Demitasse, the only animated object on the cart that can speak, is impeccably polite and treats guests with respect. As tea is served, it compliments the characters on their appearance, their manners, or whatever else it thinks might make them happy. Characters who speak to Demitasse about Zybilna learn the following information:

- Zybilna is a powerful archfey who acts as a fairy godmother to destitute mortals. Those whom Zybilna aids are immortalized as glass statues in a room above the banquet hall.
- A bearded man with a nasty disposition (**Kelek**) watches over the palace. He has been feeding the fomorian in the banquet hall ever since she invaded the palace three days ago.
- Although it doesn't know how Zybilna and her palace came to be frozen in time, Demitasse reports that Zybilna's butler, **Thinnings**, was not affected and claims that he knows more about the palace than anyone. Demitasse also knows that **Thinnings** is likely to be found in the servants' quarters (area P15), and that he's slow to trust others.

If the characters haven't already earned **Thinnings**'s trust, Demitasse advises them to share one or more secrets with the timid butler after luring him out of hiding with the following rhyme:

>*Slip underneath the doorway,*
>
>*Then fold and disappear.*
>
>*That's where you'll be hiding*
>
>*Whenever I am near.*
>
>*But I have something for you,*
>
>*A thing you don't yet know.*
>
>*I'll tell you my great secret*
>
>*If only you will show.*
>

![[096-05-006.demitasse.png|right|300]]

#### P20. Aviary

>>An enormous owl stands perfectly still in the middle of this room, its wings partially outstretched. A wall of iron bars stretching from floor to ceiling forms a protective barrier around the chamber's entrance, keeping visitors separated from the owl. The wall across from the double door has a twenty-foot-wide, circular opening sealed with hinged, semicircular windows in wrought-iron frames. The marble floor is littered with the bones of giant rats.
>>

The bars that surround the double door can't be bent or damaged, but characters can use *misty step* spells and similar magic to bypass them. The bars are 1 foot apart, leaving gaps wide enough for a Small character or a thin Medium character to squeeze through.

***Bloodybeak.*** The owl uses the **roc** stat block, has darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and is presently frozen in time. It takes up most of the room, and one of its wings brushes up against the wall of bars. **Thinnings** the butler (see area P15) knows the owl's true name: Bloodybeak. With this knowledge, characters can use the unicorn horn to free the owl from its temporal stasis, if they want to do so.

Bloodybeak is friendly toward Zybilna and hostile toward all other creatures. When the owl is no longer frozen in time, any creature within the owl's reach that Bloodybeak can see can use an action to make a DC 17 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a successful check, the owl becomes indifferent toward that creature for 1 minute or until the owl takes damage from any source. A character can use an action to repeat the check as often as desired. A creature toward which Bloodybeak is indifferent can move through the aviary and try to open the big windows without being attacked by the owl.

Bloodybeak is a natural enemy of the jabberwock in area P22. If the owl is released from temporal stasis, it attacks the jabberwock on sight.

***Windows.*** Bloodybeak is too big to enter the palace's hallways, so it comes and goes through the aviary's great windows, which at present are magically sealed shut. A *knock* spell or similar magic opens the windows, as does speaking the command word "canzus" within 10 feet of them. Only Zybilna and her quasit, Iggrik, know the command word.

#### P21. Records Room
The door to this area is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>The walls of this room are lined with square compartments holding bundles of rolled paper scrolls. In the middle of the room, an elderly dwarf in gray robes, with spectacles resting on the tip of his bulbous nose, sits perfectly still behind a writing desk facing the door. The dwarf's quill is dipped halfway into an inkpot, and his bloodshot eyes are fixed on a sheet of parchment in front of him.
>>

This room contains records of Zybilna's dealings with mortals, including contracts, pacts made with warlocks, and transcripts of conversations, all written in the Infernal script. The dwarf in temporal stasis is Kalimanzaros, Zybilna's clerk. If his statistics become necessary, Kalimanzaros uses the **mage** stat block, with these changes:

- Kalimanzaros speaks Abyssal, Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Infernal, and he has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- He has advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage.

Kalimanzaros has served Iggwilv for hundreds of years and still calls her by that name in private. He would never betray her or divulge information that could be used against her.

***Unfinished Letter.*** The letter in front of Kalimanzaros reads as follows:

>*Dear Rotten Ethel*,
>
>*You have requested access to ancient rituals handed down by Baba Yaga herself—rituals that can be used to fulfill bargains. I regret to inform you that Iggwilv is unwilling to share her knowledge of these rituals with you at this time. Your coven has much work to do to earn her favor. Until then, she wishes you well in your dark dealings with mort*
>

Kalimanzaros's quill ran dry before he could finish writing the word "mortals."

***Treasure.*** Kalimanzaros keeps a spellbook on his person. This spellbook can't be removed from the dwarf while he's frozen in time, and it contains all the spells Kalimanzaros has prepared.

#### P22. Ballroom
The doors to areas P13, P14c, and P14d are sealed with lion crown locks (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>A grand ballroom lies before you, the northern part of its floor littered with the splintered remains of three doors that have been knocked from their hinges, leaving openings through which you can see adjoining rooms.
>>
>>Throughout the ballroom, royal courtiers stand motionless, their eyes fixed on a black iron cauldron atop a dais in the middle of the chamber. Dark vapors rise from the cauldron, and a huge, dragon-like monster is coiled around it. The dragon's body twitches slightly, and its closed eyelids flutter as it dreams.
>>
>>Two figures are frozen, statue-like, off to one side of the cauldron: an imperious, middle-aged woman with long white hair and white robes, and a younger woman clad in armor and wearing a white cape. The older woman is reaching desperately toward the cauldron, while the armored woman at her side is grasping a fine-looking quarterstaff.
>>

A **jabberwock** (see *appendix C*) is coiled around the cauldron. Zybilna treated the jabberwock like a pet, regularly inviting it into her palace to feed from her cauldron. It continues to visit the palace even now that Zybilna is frozen in time, has fed recently, and is sound asleep. Characters can move quietly about the room without waking it. Loud noises cause it to awaken, as do attacks made against it and any attempts to use or disturb the cauldron. Crafty characters who don't want to engage the jabberwock in battle can try to lure it elsewhere, either by using themselves as bait or by playing music (see the "Beware the Jabberwock!" sidebar).

> ##### Beware the Jabberwock!
>Overcoming the jabberwock in area P22 is one of the main challenges of this chapter and, indeed, the whole adventure. The characters are unlikely to survive a head-on fight with the creature, but there are things they can do to increase their chances of survival:
>
>- Free the great owl from the aviary (area P20) and set it against the jabberwock. Characters toward whom the owl is indifferent can easily put the owl in a jabberwock-hunting mood if they have the means to speak with it. If the jabberwock and the owl ever make eye contact, the jabberwock flees the palace with the owl in pursuit.
>- Bait the jabberwock into leaving the palace. The jabberwock will follow prey or the sound of music. Once lured outside, assuming it's not set upon by the great owl immediately, the jabberwock goes hunting and does not return for 1d6 + 2 hours.
>- Obtain *Snicker-Snack*, the vorpal sword in area P50. The jabberwock is vulnerable to its slashing damage, and the sword's attacks can neutralize the jabberwock's Regeneration trait.

>The jabberwock is friendly toward Zybilna and hostile toward everything else, though it thinks twice about attacking anything bigger than itself. Throwing food at the jabberwock might distract it long enough to allow characters to flee its presence without risk of pursuit. Befriending the jabberwock isn't an option.
>

**Iggwilv the Witch Queen** (see her stat block at the end of the chapter), known in Prismeer as Zybilna, stands near the cauldron alongside a human cleric named **Mercion** (see appendix B).

***Cauldron.*** *Iggwilv's Cauldron* (see *appendix A*) is currently in its iron form. The characters can break the time-freezing spell on every creature and object in the palace by destroying the cauldron with a *flame tongue* or *frost brand* weapon, or by touching the cauldron with a unicorn horn while reciting a poem called "The Witch Queen's Cauldron." Only Zybilna and the hags of the Hourglass Coven know the words to this poem, but a *legend lore* spell or similar magic can also reveal them:

>*Eight cats perch atop eight dead attending*
>
>*Eight lizards flee from eight rats scavenging*
>
>*Eight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling*
>
>*Eight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming*
>
>*Eight eyes open, always dreaming*
>
>*All on the cauldron that is ever seeming.*
>

***Freeing Zybilna.*** A character can use an action to touch Zybilna with a unicorn horn while speaking her true name (Natasha). Doing so ends the time-freezing effect on her. Speaking the name Tasha, Zybilna, or Iggwilv doesn't work, since none of those is her true name.

Destroying the cauldron frees not only Zybilna but also every other creature in the palace that is frozen in time.

When Zybilna is freed from temporal stasis, skip ahead to "*Ending the Story*" at the end of the chapter.

***Freeing Mercion.*** Any member of Valor's Call can identify **Mercion**, the armored cleric at Zybilna's side. Once the characters know who she is, one of them can use an action to touch **Mercion** with a unicorn horn while speaking her name, ending the time-freezing effect on her.

If she is questioned, **Mercion** shares the story of Valor's Call (see "Fall of the Witch Queen" earlier in the chapter). She willingly joins any group committed to overcoming the League of Malevolence.

***Courtiers.*** In addition to Zybilna, **Mercion**, and the jabberwock, this room contains the following courtiers, all dressed in fancy garb and frozen in time:

- A pompous **bullywug knight** (see *appendix C*) and an emissary of the Soggy Court (see chapter 2) named Lord Slubb, the Marquis of Brackishbog
- Two **drow mages** (chaotic good) named Kelchrin and Valtis, who counsel Zybilna on matters concerning demons and the Abyss
- Snitcher, a **goblin boss** (neutral) with dragonfly wings that grant a flying speed of 40 feet and the ability to hover, who brings news from other fey courts and is attended by four similarly winged **goblins** (neutral bodyguards)
- Seven **pixies** named Bix, Henny, Honeybright, Nightglitter, Starpetal, Trick, and Winterflake
- Two **quicklings** (see *appendix C*) who serve Zybilna as messengers and spies

***Treasure.*** *Iggwilv's Cauldron* is an artifact, albeit one that its rightful owner would never part with. While she is trapped in stasis, Iggwilv can't stop thieves from taking the cauldron or hiding it. If they so desire, the characters can use **Warduke**'s *flame tongue sword* to shatter the cauldron, then do whatever they want with the fragments.

Between them, Iggwilv and **Mercion** have a *robe of the archmagi*, an *amulet of the planes*, and a *+1 quarterstaff*. Iggwilv also keeps a gray stone (the control gem for the gray slaad in area P33) in the pocket of her robe. These items are not likely to fall into the characters' hands.

![[097-05-007.bloodybeak.png|right|300]]

#### P23. Round Table
The doors leading into this room have been knocked from their hinges, and the doorways are wide open. Creatures that make too much noise here wake the **jabberwock** (see *appendix C*) in area P22, which promptly investigates.

>>This chamber contains a round, marble-topped table ringed by high-backed chairs. Between the table and a curved wall of tall, slender windows stands a motionless, white-haired wizard wielding a staff that has glittering frost erupting from its tip.
>>

**Ringlerun** (see appendix B) was ambushed in here by two members of the League of Malevolence, **Zarak** and **Zargash**. The wizard was using his *staff of power* to cast a *cone of cold* spell when he became frozen in time. Freeing **Ringlerun** from his temporal stasis unleashes the magic of the spell, the effect of which erupts out to fill most of the room.

Once he is no longer frozen in time, **Ringlerun** is determined to defeat the League of Malevolence before it can cause any more mischief. He volunteers an explanation of how Valor's Call came to the palace (see "Fall of the Witch Queen" earlier in the chapter).

***High-Backed Chairs.*** One of the chairs has a smiling quasit carved into its back, near the top. If anyone other than Zybilna sits in this chair, the quasit magically shouts "This is not your chair!" in Abyssal, repeating the line every minute until the creature gets out of the chair.

***Round Table.*** Zybilna uses the round table for meetings with her counselors. Characters who examine its marble surface find the following inscription engraved on it in the Elvish script: "I rule by the verdict of my heart and the slam of my fist."

Striking the table with a clenched fist causes it to emit a thunderous boom that can be heard up to 10 miles away. Zybilna used this power of the table to emphasize her verdicts; she also exploited it to summon the jabberwock for its dinner. If the jabberwock is still alive, it comes running if it hears this sound.

***Treasure.*** **Ringlerun** carries a *staff of power* with 15 charges remaining. (The staff has 20 charges when fully charged. Five charges were expended when **Ringlerun** used it to cast *cone of cold*. The staff can't recharge until **Ringlerun** is released from temporal stasis.)

#### P24. Ruined Staterooms
The jabberwock destroyed the furnishings in these two rooms and smashed through the doors leading to areas P22, P23, and P25. Nothing of value remains.

#### P25. Bathing Room

>>Steam rises from a murky bathing pool. The tiled floor around the bath is cracked and ruined, as though something huge had stomped across it. Whatever caused this damage also left a gaping hole in one wall, through which you can see open air and the twilight sky.
>>

If the characters make any loud noises here and have not yet encountered the **jabberwock** (see *appendix C*) in area P22, it awakens and investigates. The jabberwock enters and leaves the palace through the hole in the wall. It occasionally bathes in the murky pool and also hides its treasure there.

***Treasure.*** The water in the pool is 8 feet deep and opaque. At the bottom of the pool, amid the bones of fairies and goblins that the jabberwock has devoured, are the following treasures:

- A pair of silver armlets (25 gp each)
- An ornate steel dagger that whispers "soon" whenever its wielder falls asleep (50 gp)
- A silver helmet adorned with a black feather (125 gp)

#### P26. Changing Room
The door to the adjoining hallway is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>One wall of this chamber is lined with wooden cubicles, each containing a small bench and a hook for hanging clothes. Underfoot, a mosaic floor depicts images of demons.
>>

Any creature that hangs an article of its clothing on one of the cubicle hooks receives the benefit of an *invisibility* spell that lasts for 1 hour or until the creature ends the effect on itself by attacking or casting a spell. After receiving this benefit, a creature cannot receive it again for 24 hours.

#### P27. Armory
The door to this room is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>The room contains glass cabinets filled with a wide variety of weaponry. The weapons are so well constructed that it is difficult to tell if this display is an armory or a museum.
>>

The glass cabinets are unlocked, and the weapons in them are spectacular in appearance. The cabinets contain one of each weapon listed on the Martial Melee Weapons and Martial Ranged Weapons tables in the *Player's Handbook*. Being of particularly fine manufacture, they are worth twice the listed price. Each weapon is enchanted to shower its wielder with compliments. If complimented on its own form in return, a weapon glumly whispers, "Ah, but I'm not as fine as *Snicker-Snack*," and then never speaks again.

#### P28. Library
The doors to the adjoining hallway are sealed with lion crown locks (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>Leather-bound tomes fill the tall shelves of this grand library. Rolling ladders anchored to rails above the topmost shelves allow easy access to the higher books.
>>
>>Appearing from behind a bookshelf is an elderly hunchbacked man carrying an open book. "This library is closed to visitors!" he says, snapping the book closed and making no effort to hide his surprise and his annoyance.
>>

Zybilna keeps her most esoteric tomes in a separate library upstairs (area P38), but this room still contains a vast collection of books on all manner of subjects. It exists in a demiplane. Because of the library's demiplanar nature, its occupants and contents were not frozen in time by *Iggwilv's Cauldron*.

![[098-05-008.shon-and-gray.png|right|300]]

***Shon and Gray.*** The librarian is a hunchbacked human **mage** (neutral) named Shon. He speaks Abyssal, Common, Elvish, and Sylvan, and he has a secret known only to himself, Zybilna, and her quasit, Iggrik: his "hump" is a **giant wolf spider** named Gray, which Shon hides under thick shawls. An *awaken* spell was cast on the spider, giving it an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Elvish. Of the two, the spider knows the library better and is more adept at locating rare tomes. The spider defends Shon if the mage is attacked.

Shon confronts intruders and orders them to leave the library at once, claiming that no one may peruse the books without Zybilna's consent. Zybilna has made no such declaration, but Shon doesn't trust visitors not to steal the books. If necessary, he uses *suggestion* spells to force intruders to "get out and stay out!" If the characters stubbornly refuse to leave, Shon tells them that Zybilna keeps her most prized books in a smaller upstairs library and urges them to explore it instead. He even takes the time to write down a list of eight book titles found there that might interest them (see area P38).

When Zybilna and her court were frozen in time, Shon was shielded by the library's demiplanar nature. He ventured forth to discover the League of Malevolence in charge. Shon is afraid of the league but has come to an agreement with its leader, **Kelek**: the league will allow Shon to remain at his post, and in exchange, Shon (and his spider) will use the library to research time-freezing magic, with the goal of helping the league break the spell on **Ringlerun** the wizard so that **Kelek** can obtain the wizard's *staff of power* (in area P23). So far, Shon and Gray have found nothing helpful. Each of them can describe all five members of the league and knows that three of them—**Kelek**, **Warduke**, and **Zargash**—are in the palace.

**Kelek** has told Shon that Zybilna was betrayed by the Hourglass Coven, and that the hags have entrusted the League of Malevolence with protecting *Iggwilv's Cauldron*. The conversations that Shon has had with **Kelek** suggest that the alliance between the league and the Hourglass Coven isn't as strong as **Kelek** pretends it is. Gray overheard these conversations and knows this information as well.

If the characters tell Shon that they intend to free Zybilna and defeat the League of Malevolence, he shares the following information while showing them the door, determined to keep them from disturbing the books:

- A jabberwock has made its lair in the ballroom. **Kelek**, the leader of the League of Malevolence, is terrified of it ("as he should be," Shon adds).
- **Warduke**, a helmed warrior with a flaming sword, acts as **Kelek**'s bodyguard, but not out of loyalty. He's a cold-hearted mercenary who works for coin. The characters might be able to buy him off.
- Shon can describe all the properties of a *staff of power*, having researched the subject recently.

*Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Shon.

***Shon's Spellbook.*** Shon carries his spellbook, which is a leather-bound tome with a charcoal sketch of a wolf spider on the title page. This book contains the following spells: *charm person*, *cone of cold*, *counterspell*, *darkvision*, *detect magic*, *fireball*, *fly*, *greater invisibility*, *ice storm*, *knock*, *mage armor*, *magic missile*, *misty step*, *polymorph*, *remove curse*, *shield*, *suggestion*, and *Tasha's hideous laughter*.

***Unicorn Horn.*** If the *Story Tracker* indicates that the unicorn horn is here, Shon has it. He doesn't want **Kelek** to get his hands on the *staff of power*, realizing the harm he would cause with it. Consequently, Shon has no intention of handing the staff over to the League of Malevolence. If, through good roleplaying, the characters convince Shon that they have Prismeer's best interests at heart, he gives them the horn and tells them where to find Zybilna (area P22), warning them about the jabberwock if he hasn't already done so.

#### P29. Rug of White Roses
The door to area P30 is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter). The door on the opposite wall opens onto a balcony that overlooks the Court of Storms (area P13).

>>Running the length of this oblong room is a rug woven with images of thorny white roses. Each of the doors on the north and south walls has an alabaster pedestal standing inside the room beside it. Atop each pedestal is an alabaster vase that holds several long-stemmed white roses. Carved into the vase are the words "Take one" in Common.
>>

A creature holding or carrying a white rose can pass through this hall safely. The rug is a 40-foot-long, 8-foot-wide **rug of smothering** with 60 hit points. If a creature not carrying a white rose ends its turn in the hall, the rug attacks it. The rug also attacks creatures that deal damage to it. Because of its length, the rug can smother up to four Medium or smaller creatures at once.

#### P30. Sludge-Filled Tower
The door to this tower is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>Everything in this tower appears to be frozen in place. A five-foot-wide ledge at floor level circles the room, and a row of five iron levers protrudes from the wall above the ledge on the far side of the room. Five feet below the ledge is the surface of a pool of reeking sludge. Five slender, gilded cages dangle from chains that hang down from holes in the sixty-foot-high ceiling. Three of the cages are occupied. Suspended in midair outside each cage is a pixie holding a tiny, gilded wand.
>>

**Zargash** (see appendix B) is here if he hasn't been lured elsewhere. If **Zargash** is present, add:

>>Standing motionless next to the levers is a man garbed in black whose face is half-hidden by a hood. A bat-shaped amulet hangs around his neck, and he tightly grips a quarterstaff.
>>

**Zargash** has been taking samples of the sludge in the pool, hoping to learn more about its properties. He stands motionless, pretending to be frozen in time like the other creatures here. If left alone, he waits for the characters to leave the area, then reports to **Kelek** in area P31.

Characters who observe **Zargash** can, with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check, determine that he is not frozen in time. Because he's pretending to be frozen, the first attack made against him has advantage. If his ruse is exposed or if he's attacked, **Zargash** uses his next action to cast *gaseous form* on himself, then flies up to area P39 and heads to area P31 to warn **Kelek** and **Warduke** that intruders have entered the palace.

***Cages and Pixie Jailers.*** The floors of the five cages are currently suspended above the sludge at heights of 10 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet, 40 feet, and 50 feet, respectively. Each cage's height is controlled by one of the levers on the far side of the narrow ledge. Normally, moving a lever up or down causes its cage to ascend or descend at a rate of 1 foot per second; at present, however, the mechanisms that raise and lower the cages are frozen in time, and until the time-freezing effect ends, nothing happens when any of the levers are moved.

Each cage can hold one Medium or smaller creature. The cages have no doors or locks; creatures are teleported into and out of the cages using the tiny, gilded wands carried by the five **pixies**, all of which are frozen in time. Only pixies can attune to these tiny wands. As an action, a pixie released from temporal stasis can use its wand to target a Medium or smaller creature it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, it is teleported into the gilded cage corresponding to that pixie, and any creature already occupying that cage teleports to the space vacated by the target. A pixie released from temporal stasis can use an action to touch its wand to its corresponding cage, which teleports any creature inside that cage to an unoccupied space of the pixie's choice on the ledge.

A character can use an action to try to bend a cage's bars, doing so with a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check and creating an opening wide enough for a Small or Medium character to squeeze into or out of the cage.

***Demonic Sludge.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic emanating from the sludge, which comes from the Abyss. Any Humanoid that starts its turn wholly or partly immersed in the sludge must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage as its mind is ravaged by nightmarish visions too horrible to describe. On a failed save, the creature is magically transformed into a **manes** under your control. This transformation can be reversed by any magic that ends a curse. If the transformation is not reversed within three days, it becomes permanent and can be reversed only by a *wish* spell or divine intervention.

***Prisoners.*** Three of the cages hold prisoners in temporal stasis:

- The cage suspended 10 feet above the sludge contains a **manes**.
- The cage suspended 20 feet above the sludge contains an **incubus** in the guise of a male high elf named Nizran (not his true name). The incubus, whose Etherealness trait does not function in the Feywild, infiltrated Zybilna's court by pretending to be an emissary of the Summer Queen. Zybilna saw through the deception, ascertained the incubus's true allegiance to the demon lord Graz'zt (her former lover), and incarcerated the incubus before he could return to his true master.
- The cage suspended 40 feet above the sludge holds a nameless, unshaven man with a crescent-shaped scar under his right eye. A retired human **spy** (neutral) from Oerth, he is unarmed. He begged Zybilna to rid him of the guilt he feels for several murders he committed. She obliged by locking him up and promising to transform him into a manes—a creature incapable of feeling guilt.

Even if they are freed from temporal stasis, the prisoners remain trapped in their cages until the pixies release them, which they can't do while frozen in time and which they're not inclined to do unless the order comes from Zybilna. Nizran and the nameless man want nothing more than to flee the palace and never return.

#### P31. Throne Room
This chamber can be reached by descending a staircase from area P47. A double door in the north wall pulls open to reveal a stone balcony that overlooks the Court of Storms (area P13).

>>A ring of marble pillars sculpted with images of fairies and demons supports the arched ceiling of this circular chamber. Seven archways spaced evenly around the room's perimeter lead to empty turrets with tall, stained-glass windows set in their walls. Each window bears the image of a knight in armor.
>>
>>Near the middle of the room, a short, gray-bearded man in black robes reclines on a gilded wooden throne with clawed feet. The man grips the leashes of three small, scaly, birdlike creatures. A muscular, armored man stands next to the throne. He wears a helm that conceals his face except for his red, glowing eyes, and his sword he holds is wreathed in flames.
>>
>>A statue of an unarmored elf stands in front of the throne. The statue is posed as if ready for battle, with a shortsword gripped tightly in each of its hands.
>>

The gray-bearded man is **Kelek**, and he keeps three **cockatrices** on short leashes. **Warduke** stands beside him, shield and flaming sword at the ready. If the characters encountered **Zargash** previously and allowed him to get away, the evil priest of Orcus is crouched behind the throne. (Statistics for all three villains appear in appendix B.) While seated on the throne, **Kelek** can use a bonus action to speak a rhyme taught to him by the Hourglass Coven ("Knights of glass, protect my ass!"). The rhyme causes the four stained-glass knights in the turrets marked X on the map to leap from their window frames, becoming four **glasswork golems** (see the accompanying stat block). These golems defend **Kelek**, returning to their windows after 10 minutes if they haven't been destroyed by then.

If the characters parley with **Kelek**, he sneers that the palace is now his to rule, though any mention of the Hourglass Coven or the jabberwock causes a flush of dread to pass over **Kelek**'s face. Throughout any conversation, **Warduke** remains silent, eyeing the party mirthlessly. **Zargash**, if present, does as little as possible to help **Kelek** without revealing his treasonous heart. He wants to replace **Kelek** as leader of the League of Malevolence, but he is certain **Warduke** will slay him if he openly betrays **Kelek**.

![[099-637677440077795828.png|right|300]]

If the characters mention **Ringlerun**, **Kelek** explains that he wants the *staff of power* that belongs to the wizard, but he can't take it while **Ringlerun** is frozen in time. To free **Ringlerun**, **Kelek** needs a unicorn horn. (He won't explain how the horn works.) In exchange for a unicorn horn, **Kelek** promises to help the characters achieve their goals, provided their stated goals have nothing to do with freeing Zybilna. **Kelek** has no intention of fulfilling his part of any bargain.

If conflict erupts, **Kelek** relies on **Warduke**, the cockatrices, and **Zargash** to defend him. **Zargash** flees if the battle is going poorly for his side.

**Warduke**'s loyalty can be bought for a reasonable price (treasure worth 2,500 gp or more). If the characters recruit him, **Warduke** stays with the party for the remainder of the adventure, then goes his own way. While in the party's employ, **Warduke** stoically follows the characters around, defending them when needed, and can easily be persuaded to use his *flame tongue* sword to destroy *Iggwilv's Cauldron*.

Neither **Kelek** nor **Zargash** will threaten or harm the characters while **Warduke** is on the party's side. In the face of certain defeat, **Kelek** begs for mercy and offers to reveal a secret about Zybilna in exchange for his life and freedom. If the party agrees, **Kelek** reveals that Zybilna is **Iggwilv the Witch Queen** and explains how he plotted to blackmail her.

***Petrified Elf.*** The statue is a petrified high elf named **Raezil** Uthemar (neutral). **Raezil** served as Zybilna's spy in other fey courts. She returned from a mission to find nearly everyone in the palace trapped in temporal stasis. When she confronted **Kelek** and accused him of conspiring to overthrow Zybilna, his cockatrices petrified her. If magic is used to end the petrified condition on **Raezil**, use the **spy** stat block to represent her, with these changes:

- **Raezil** speaks Common and Elvish.
- She has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- She has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put her to sleep.

The name "Iggwilv" means nothing to **Raezil**, who started working for Zybilna shortly after the archfey carved out her domain in the Feywild. **Raezil** spends most of her time abroad, in the courts of other archfey, and hasn't kept up on the politics of Prismeer.

Once she is no longer petrified, **Raezil** is bound by the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*) to help the characters complete any outstanding quests they might have. **Raezil** comes from a highborn elf family with influence in the Summer Court, making her a useful retainer if the characters choose to remain in the Feywild after their adventures in Prismeer have ended.

***Treasure.*** **Kelek** carries a *staff of striking* and wears *bracers of defense*. **Warduke** wields a *flame tongue longsword*. **Zargash** wears a bat-shaped amulet that has the properties of a *ring of feather falling*.

### Upper Palace Locations
![[101-map-5.2-palace-upper-player.jpg|right|300]]
#### P32. Minstrels' Gallery
This balcony extends out over the banquet hall (area P18). The door on the west wall is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>This thirty-foot-high balcony overlooks the banquet hall. A harpsichord decorated with painted panels is situated at one end of the balcony near a double door.
>>

The harpsichord is a Medium object with AC 15, 12 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around it. If it loses half or more of its hit points, the harpsichord is too damaged to play music. Reducing the harpsichord to 0 hit points destroys it and causes eight pieces of wreckage to magically spring to life and attack the harpsichord's assailants. Each piece of wreckage is treated as a Tiny object under the effect of an *animate objects* spell that lasts for 1 minute.

#### P33. Glass Statues

>>The floor of this marble hall is polished to a mirror-like finish. The exterior walls are lined with stained-glass windows depicting fairies and butterflies in flight. A glass statue of a long-haired woman in robes stands atop a dais, her arms outstretched in a welcoming gesture. A tiny, incandescent blue sphere is suspended in the air next to the statue's head. Dozens of other statues made of sparkling glass are arranged about the room.
>>

This room contains forty glass statues, including the one on the dais. The statues stand motionless until someone plays the harpsichord in area P32, the magic of which causes the statues to dance:

>>All of the statues except the one on the dais waltz and twirl about the room, their steps keeping time with the music from the harpsichord.
>>

When the music from the harpsichord stops playing, the statues freeze in place until the music resumes.

Characters who have seen Zybilna recognize her likeness in the statue on the dais. The remaining thirty-nine statues represent mortals whom Zybilna aided in her role as fairy godmother. A glass scullery maid dances with a glass princess, a glass farmer carries a glass pot filled with glass coins, and so on. Each statue (including the one on the dais) has AC 13, 4 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

While the statues are dancing, any creature that enters the room or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid colliding with a statue. Reduce the DC by 1 for every three dancing statues that have been destroyed. A collision with a creature causes a statue to shatter and deals 14 (4d6) psychic damage to the creature that struck it. The dancing statues avoid the dais and can't collide with creatures on it, nor can they collide with creatures they can't reach (creatures flying above them, for example).

This statue on the dais doesn't move, and the tiny sphere floating next to its head is frozen in time and magical (see "Treasure" below). It remains suspended in the air above the dais even if the statue on the dais is destroyed.

***Slaad Guardian.*** An invisible **gray slaad** in its true form appears near the dais when one of the following conditions is met:

- Three or more dancing statues are destroyed.
- The statue on the dais is destroyed.
- Someone grabs the tiny sphere.

The slaad normally resides in a demiplane and was not affected by the time-freezing magic of *Iggwilv's Cauldron*. It attacks any creature that has the tiny sphere in its possession, turning visible as it does so. If it obtains the sphere, the slaad keeps it, turns invisible, remains in this room, and defends itself if attacked. It can be harmed by the dancing statues.

Zybilna pressed the slaad into service, and it does her bidding if she's around to give it commands.

***Treasure.*** The blue sphere is an * Ioun stone (insight)* that belongs to Iggwilv. Any other creature that attunes to the *Ioun stone* is cursed. While cursed in this way, the creature is magically transformed into an animated, doll-like effigy of itself made of wood. The creature's statistics are the same, except that it is a Construct with vulnerability to fire damage, and it doesn't require air, food, or water. Items worn or carried by the creature are unaffected. A *wish* spell can end the curse. The creature can end the curse on itself by giving a bouquet of eight black roses to Iggwilv, but only Iggwilv and Iggrik (the quasit in area P51) know that the curse can be ended in this way. The black roses can be harvested from the rose garden (area P7).

#### P34. Hall of Hatches

>>Four three-foot-square oak panels are mounted on the wall along the east side of this short hall. Each panel has a hinged hatch attached to a wooden handle.
>>

When the characters first enter, all four panels are closed. Opening a hatch reveals a square cavity containing the head of a decapitated creature. When a hatch is opened, the head inside that cavity barks one of the following utterances:

>Bugbear head: "Yah!"
>
>Harpy head: "Bah!"
>
>Hobgoblin head: "Gah!"
>
>Ogre head: "Bah!"
>

Each repeats its one-word utterance every time its hatch is opened, then falls silent until the hatch is closed and opened again. To use this area as it was intended, the panels must all be closed and then opened in either of the following sequences:

>Harpy, ogre, bugbear, hobgoblin
>
>Ogre, harpy, bugbear, hobgoblin
>

When the decapitated heads speak the syllables of "Baba Yaga" in their proper order, all creatures in the hall are teleported to unoccupied spaces in the study (area P47).

#### P35. Flooded Hall

>>This hallway has a sunken floor filled to a depth of three feet with dark water. Lanterns lit with flickering blue flames hang from the ceiling thirty feet above by short chains, spaced roughly ten feet apart. They produce eerie, ghostlike reflections off the water. As you take in the scene, an empty sailboat drifts into view from farther down the hall and makes its way toward you.
>>

The sailboat glides closer until it is near enough to board safely. The boat can carry up to eight Medium creatures. One creature can steer the boat using the tiller, and the boat has a speed of 20 feet.

***Dark Water.*** Peering into the water's depths reveals thin, pale faces staring back, dark monsters swimming past, and glimpses of distant realms. A creature can wade through the water safely, but any creature that completely submerges itself must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become trapped under the water's surface. Unless the creature can breathe underwater, it begins to *suffocate* when it runs out of air (see the *suffocation* rules in the *Player's Handbook*). As an action, a creature trapped under the water's surface or another creature within reach of it can make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the trapped creature breaks through the surface and is no longer submerged.

#### P36. Costume Room

>>This room contains eight wooden mannequins in tall glass cases. Each mannequin wears a different outfit.
>>

These outfits have been worn by Zybilna in her many guises—a child's witchy dress for young Natasha; a flamboyant, off-the-shoulder dress for Tasha; a dark, alluring gown for Iggwilv; and more.

The following clues can help the characters identify some of Zybilna's former personas:

- The name "Natasha" is stitched into the collar of a cape sized for a child.
- Characters who examined the mannequin of Tasha in the glass cabinet outside the Hall of Illusions in the Witchlight Carnival can recognize Tasha's costume from the way the mannequin was dressed.
- Characters who succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (History) check can recognize one of Iggwilv's costumes from a woodcut of her that they saw once in a book, where she was identified as "Iggwilv, the Witch Queen of Perrenland."

#### P37. Dretch Nursery

>>Flies buzz throughout this chamber, and the grimy marble floor is crawling with maggots. Eight wicker cradles stand upright in the filth. Lashed to each cradle is a three-foot-long, curved wooden pole with a mobile consisting of three ornaments dangling at the top of it. Each ornament appears to be a triangular piece of white wood with an Elvish letter carved into it. Small, misshapen creatures nesting in the cradles reach toward the symbols with their claws but can't quite grab them.
>>

The cradles contain eight **dretches**—manifestations of Zybilna's darkest emotions: annoyance, loathing, rage, disgust, disdain, maliciousness, **envy**, and jealousy. The stunted, baby-like fiends act according to their nature; for example, the annoyed dretch frowns in irritation at everything it sees, the malicious dretch tries to pinch anyone who comes too close to it, and so forth.

A character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to ascertain why the dretches are here and what they represent. On a failed check, the character ascertains nothing. On a successful check, the character realizes that the dretches are manifestations of suppressed negative emotions belonging to whoever confined them to this wretched nursery.

Characters who can read the Elvish script can identify seven different letters carved into the triangular ornaments suspended above the cradles. The letters, each of which appear several times, are A, B, I, L, N, Y, and Z. Rearranged, they spell ZYBILNA. Zybilna needed the lettered ornaments as material components for the ritual that created the dretches, but now they are merely decorative distractions for the baby-like dretches. The letters are attached to the mobiles at random; for example, one cradle's mobile might have the letters A, I, and L, while another might have the letters B, L, and Y.

Each dretch is bound by Zybilna's magic and has a speed of 0 feet while in its cradle. If a dretch is removed from its cradle, its disposition doesn't change, but it is free to go where it pleases. It shuns combat and fights only in self-defense. Killing one or more dretches causes an upswell of dark emotions in Iggwilv, which can have consequences for the characters in their climactic encounter with her (as described at the end of the chapter).

#### P38. Secret Library

>>A dozen floating candles cast dim, flickering lights over this sepulchral, windowless library. Ebony bookshelves are filled with volumes bound in jet-black fabric. The books have no titles on their spines. In the middle of the room, a black quill pen rests on a writing desk next to a jar of black ink.
>>

Magic causes each candle to float 1d4 + 3 feet above the floor. Casting *dispel magic* on a candle or removing a candle from the library automatically ends the levitation effect on it.

If the characters remove a book from the shelves, they see that the cover, like the spine, has no title. Opening any of the books reveals that its pages are blank apart from the first page, on which a thin line has been scribed. If a creature uses the quill pen on the desk to write the title of a book above the line, the remaining pages of the book fill with writing that matches the book of the same title, provided that book is part of this room's collection. Writing a title in a blank book that does not match the title of a book in the collection causes the ink to swiftly evaporate from the page. If a book is removed from this library, all writing in it fades after 30 days, leaving the book blank.

Among the titles found here are the following, which the characters can learn about from Shon in area P28:

*The City That Waits* (one explorer's treatise about Moil, a demiplane that houses a city of haunted spires)

*The Faceless Lord* (Iggwilv's private account of her many dealings with Juiblex, the Demon Prince of Oozes and Slimes—which she later updated and incorporated into her magnum opus, the *Demonomicon of Iggwilv*)

*I, Lyzandred* (a lich's meandering autobiography, which drifts into a lengthy, plodding dissertation about demiplanes and how to construct them)

*Kingdom of the Ghouls* (one adventuring party's exploration of a subterranean kingdom of ghouls on the world of Oerth)

*The Many Masques of Mith* (a bizarre account of life as a servant to an archwizard named Mith, who hosted masques for honored guests from across the multiverse)

*Nadir of Nessus* (all about the politics of the Nine Hells, written by a tiefling named Nadir, who claimed to be the daughter of Asmodeus)

*Prophecies of Explictica Defilus* (a transcription of various prophecies told by a powerful spirit naga from the world of Oerth)

*Thingizzard's Night Balloon* (instructions for building a magic vessel that can float safely through the layers of the Abyss)

#### P39. Roost
This 20-foot-square room has an 8-foot-wide, 8-foot-tall archway in the middle of the west wall, beyond which a tower chamber contains five cages dangling from chains above a pool of sludge 30 feet below. Characters who position themselves near the archway can see the ceiling of the tower chamber 30 feet above them, as well as the other features of area P30.

Floor-to-ceiling iron bars spaced 6 inches apart span the eastern side of this room. Through this wall of bars, one can see the palace's central tower suspended above a stormy void (area P13). The bars can be bent with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, creating an opening through which Small and Medium characters can squeeze.

#### P40. Guest Wing
This wing of the palace is reserved for Zybilna's guests, including envoys from other archfey and petitioners from the Material Plane.

![[102-05-009.frozen-in-time.png|right|300]]

Each room holds a four-poster bed, a wardrobe containing outfits that magically tailor themselves to their wearers, and a dressing table. A bell pull mounted on the wall by the door enables guests to summon servants from their quarters (area P15). If the characters ring any of these bells, the butler **Thinnings** creeps up to investigate 5 minutes later.

Each room's occupants are frozen in time. Individual rooms have their own color schemes and notable features, as indicated below:

- **P40a** Red Room. A high elf **noble** (neutral) with long hair stands in the middle of the room. The elf, Carisso, is holding a crystal goblet of water. Tied to his belt is a glass-handled rapier (actually a *+1 rapier*). A goblin (noncombatant) stands next to him, holding a tray with a decanter of water on it.
- **P40b** Blue Room. This chamber has a line of bluebirds perched motionless on the sill of an open window. The room is otherwise unoccupied.
- **P40c** Green Room. A well-dressed forest gnome (noncombatant) stands on a stool in front of a vanity, looking into a mirror as she combs her green hair. The vanity has various cosmetics and vials of perfume on it.
- **P40d** White Room. A handsome young male human (noncombatant) in a white nightshirt sleeps in the bed.
- **P40e** Black Room. Six goblins (noncombatants) are in the midst of cleaning the room. One of them perches precariously on a stack of chairs while reaching out to dust the top of a tall black wardrobe.

#### P41. Talking Door
This door is closed and magically locked.

>>The surface of this double door is sculpted to look like the head of a cat. As you approach, it purrs, "Why, hello there."
>>

This door was meant to require a password to be opened, but the door grew bored of asking for the same word all the time and now seeks answers to more meaningful, philosophical questions. The door explains this pleasantly, then poses one of the following questions:

- Which is more important, intelligence or wisdom?
- Are we at the mercy of fate, or do we create our own destiny?
- Which has more power, the sword or the quill?

The door enthusiastically debates either side of each point. There are no right or wrong answers; to open the door, a character must argue their case and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A character who impressed Feathereen, the gondola swan in the Witchlight Carnival, is filled with confidence in this debate and gains advantage on the check. On a successful check, the door swings open.

#### P42. Laboratory
The door to this laboratory is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>Broken oil burners, grimy glassware, and jars of pickled fungus clutter this ruined laboratory. A beanstalk as long and thick as a constrictor snake sprouts from an unstoppered potion bottle. Bulging bean pods hang from its stem.
>>

Zybilna used this laboratory to brew potions, including an experimental oil that stimulated the growth of plants. The beanstalk in here is one result of this study; Zybilna's quasit, Iggrik, pilfered and used a more potent variant of this potion to create the enormous beanstalk in area P17.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the laboratory find a *potion of growth*, three *potions of healing*, and two *potions of giant strength (hill)*.

Twelve bean pods hang on the beanstalk and are easily detached. A detached bean pod can be hurled up to 120 feet as an action. When it is tossed on the ground, it disappears and produces an effect identical to that of the *plant growth* spell (the version of the spell that takes 1 action to cast).

#### P43. Mirror of Heart's Desire
The door to this room is sealed with a lion crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>This marble hall is empty except for a tall mirror mounted in an alcove on the north wall. Cold, spectral mist hangs motionless in front of the mirror's reflective surface and covers the floor beneath it.
>>

Zybilna brought mortals before this mirror, where they could see the objects of their heart's desire reflected in it. Any creature that stares into the mirror for 1 minute sees its own reflection fade away, to be replaced by an image of the thing it wants most. The mirror is a Large object with AC 13, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

If a character looks into the mirror long enough to trigger its property, work with that character's player to determine what the character sees: it might be something or someone the character lost, a goal the character has yet to attain, or a momentous event that has not yet come to pass. If you are using the "Lost Things" adventure hook and the character hasn't yet found what they're looking for, the mirror might show the character its location and a route the character can take to get there.

#### P44. Jars of Time
The door to this room is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>A three-level mahogany table stands in the middle of this otherwise empty chamber. Three gleaming bell jars rest on the table's separate tiers, each one containing a visage wreathed in mist.
>>

Any creature that touches one of the jars on the table causes all three jars to display illusory images of that creature from different time periods. The jar closest to the floor shows the creature in its youth. The jar on the middle tier shows the creature as it is now. The highest jar shows what the creature might look like in its later years. Zybilna was the last one to touch the jars, so they currently show images of her past, present, and future self:

- The lowest jar depicts a young woman with raven-black hair.
- The middle jar displays a middle-aged woman with long white hair.
- The highest jar shows a white-haired crone or hag.

The jars are stuck to the table with *sovereign glue*. Each jar is a Small object with AC 13, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. For each jar that breaks, an **invisible stalker** is released, appearing in the air above the table. A stalker attacks whoever is responsible for breaking its jar, ignoring all other targets. The stalker returns to the Elemental Plane of Air when it or its target dies.

![[103-05-010.jars-of-time.png|right|300]]

#### P45. Zybilna's Bedroom

>>This spacious bedchamber is lightly furnished. An oval mirror in a black wood frame is mounted on the east wall, and a chess set with jet and bloodstone playing pieces rests atop an octagonal table in the southwest corner, flanked by two comfortable, high-backed chairs. A four-poster bed with black silk sheets and drapes stands in the middle of this room. Lounging on the bed are two creatures, each with the lower body of a lion. One has the head and upper torso of a woman, the other the head and upper torso of a man.
>>

The creatures on the bed are two **lamias** named Nemesatra and Trizzian. The demon prince Graz'zt sent them to parley with Zybilna, because he is convinced that the archfey knows the whereabouts of **Iggwilv the Witch Queen** (with whom Graz'zt has unfinished business). Nemesatra and Trizzian suspect that Zybilna and Iggwilv are the same person, but the lamias need proof before they return to their master.

Graz'zt has bestowed on each lamia the ability to touch the surface of any mirror (as an action), disappear inside it, and reappear on another plane of existence of their choice, as though the lamia had cast a *plane shift* spell that affects only one creature. Nemesatra and Trizzian used this ability to travel from Azzagrat (Graz'zt's home in the Abyss) to the Feywild, and they plan to use it again to return to Azzagrat once they get the proof they desire. The costumes in area P36 are not proof enough on their own, but any or all of the following constitute proof:

- The sworn testimony of **Thinnings** the butler (see area P15), Kalimanzaros the dwarf (see area P21), or one of the hags in area P47, which the lamias must obtain using a *suggestion* or *geas* spell
- A copy of *The Faceless Lord* (one of Iggwilv's known unpublished works) from area P38
- The jars of time in area P44, provided and the jars still show three faces of Iggwilv (including her younger self, which the lamias recognize)

When one or more characters appear before the lamias, Nemesatra fixes them with a steely gaze and asks, "Are you important?" She expects an affirmative reply, for neither she nor her companion have time for wastrels. Nemesatra and Trizzian won't reveal the purpose of their mission. They view the characters as pawns, ordering them to share any information they uncover about Zybilna's past. Once the lamias obtain proof that Zybilna is Iggwilv (or cleverly fabricated evidence to the contrary), they use the nearest mirror to return to Azzagrat.

The lamias' access to the palace is limited because they can't bypass its locked doors or fly. They entered the palace through the coach house (area P11) and have visited areas P29, P14c, P14g, P41 (where they debated the magical door), and P46.

If the lamias are attacked, they defend themselves until at least one of them loses half of their hit points or more, whereupon they touch the mirror in this chamber and return to the Abyss. If the mirror has been destroyed and they have no clear route of escape, the lamias use *charm person*, *suggestion*, or *geas* spells to persuade the characters to leave them alone.

***Treasure.*** The chessboard was a gift to Iggwilv from the archmage Mordenkainen and is worth 2,500 gp. Its pieces mutter under their breath when they are taken off the board. The chessboard is one reason why Nemesatra and Trizzian suspect that Zybilna and Iggwilv might be one and the same, since Iggwilv's passion for the game is well known to Graz'zt and his underlings.

#### P46. Dressing Room

>>This chamber is a walk-in wardrobe. Hinged panels along the walls swing outward to display a variety of exquisitely crafted robes, gowns, scarves, headdresses, stockings, gloves, shoes, boots, and other clothing. Items remove themselves from hooks and hangers and float in the air seemingly of their own accord, allowing you to see them more closely.
>>

Permanent *unseen servant* spells make trying on clothes in this room easy and fun.

#### P47. Destroyed Study

>>Splinters of wood, along with some loose papers and two halves of a shattered blowing horn, are suspended in the air. Whatever caused this unfortunate scene also punched a hole in the north wall on the landing between two staircases, one leading up and the other leading down. The stony debris from the blast is frozen in midair outside the tower.
>>

Characters who peer through the hole in the wall see the following scene:

>>A human knight with a thick mustache and a look of surprise on his face was apparently thrown backward through the jagged hole and now hangs in the air amid the debris. The knight wears a helm adorned with feathery wings, and he is holding a longsword and a shield.
>>

Nothing of value remains in the study.

Any hags of the Hourglass Coven who retreated to the palace are found here, near the hole in the wall (see appendix B for the hags' stat blocks). Parked nearby are their mounts and vehicles:

- Bavlorna's *bobbing lily pad* (see *appendix A*)
- Skabatha's **flying rocking horse** (see chapter 3)
- Endelyn's *ornithopter of flying* (see *appendix A*)

If only one hag is present, she is muttering to herself. If two hags are here, they are bickering about what to do next. If all three hags are present, they are mocking the helmed knight as they avoid talking about their present troubles. "He seems to be taking his present situation rather lightly," says Skabatha. "Time has been rather cruel to him," gloats Endelyn. "If we still had the unicorn horn, we could make him plunge to his doom," bemoans Bavlorna.

If **Endelyn Moongrave** is encountered here, she tells the characters that she foresaw the dissolution of the coven. If one or both of her sisters are in earshot when she says this, they accuse Endelyn of orchestrating the coven's breakup. Arguing ensues, ending with each hag using her *plane shift* spell to flee Prismeer. The hags also use this spell to escape if the characters attack them.

Otherwise, the hags do what they do best: deceive and bargain. They claim to be the true heroes of the situation, since they trapped Iggwilv in time to save Prismeer from her tyranny and debauchery. They relate memories of Iggwilv's past, portraying her as a demented archmage who peered into the Abyss, studied it intently to learn how to summon and control demons, and used them to ravage kingdoms on the Material Plane. The hags suggest that the characters focus their efforts on slaying the jabberwock. In exchange, the hags promise to use the power of *Iggwilv's Cauldron* for the characters' benefit, further tempting them by describing the cauldron's many beneficial properties (see *appendix A*). The hags hope to buy time until they can turn the tables on the characters and make them suffer for their insolence.

***Leader of Valor's Call.*** The helmed knight, named **Strongheart** (see appendix B), battled **Kelek** and **Warduke** in this study. **Warduke** used a *horn of blasting* to punch a hole in the wall and sent the knight hurtling through it. An instant later, the palace was frozen in time. The horn was destroyed in the blast, which also dealt damage to **Warduke** and **Kelek**. (Those two were later released from temporal stasis by the Hourglass Coven and allowed to rest and regain their lost hit points.) **Strongheart** is suspended 30 feet north of the tower and 60 feet above the storm vortex (area P13). He has 20 hit points remaining.

If **Strongheart**'s temporal stasis ends while he's suspended over the storm vortex, he falls into the vortex. A character within reach of **Strongheart** can try to catch him as he falls, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Alternatively, characters who can fly could reach **Strongheart** while he's frozen in the air, tie one end of a rope around him, and secure the other end to something or someone strong enough to bear his weight (240 pounds with all his gear), thus preventing him from falling when the temporal stasis ends.

If rescued and questioned, **Strongheart** explains his role in leading Valor's Call to the palace (see "Fall of the Witch Queen" earlier in the chapter). He planned to bring the members of the League of Malevolence to justice, but he underestimated their tenacity and resourcefulness. He is grateful to his rescuers and offers to help them accomplish whatever goals brought them to Prismeer. Other members of Valor's Call follow his lead.

***Stairs Up and Down.*** Stairs to either side of the hole in the wall lead down to area P31 and up to area P49.

***Treasure.*** **Strongheart** wields *Steel*, a magic longsword (see *appendix A*). The sentient blade can't be removed from the knight's hand while he's frozen in time, and it can't communicate or be used to cast *revivify* until it is released from temporal stasis.

#### P48. Turrets
These seven turrets, areas P48a through P48g, are attached to the palace's central tower. None of these areas have windows. The contents of the seven turrets are as follows:

- **P48a** An enameled blue coffer rests on an alabaster pedestal in the middle of this room, which is connected by an open archway to a staircase that leads down to area P31 and up to areas P47 and P49. The coffer contains a plum-sized jewel made of transparent blue crystal with a tiny, Z-shaped crack in its core (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to be treated as a queen and rule over lesser beings.
- **P48b** Characters can reach this chamber by climbing a staircase from area Pl4b on the palace's lower level. An enameled white coffer rests on a black basalt pedestal in the middle of the room. The coffer contains a plum-sized jewel made of translucent white crystal. The jewel is warm to the touch (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to show kindness to the destitute and unfortunate.
- **P48c** Characters can reach this chamber by climbing a short staircase from area P48d. An enameled red coffer rests on a pedestal of rotting wood in the middle of the room. The coffer contains a plum-sized jewel made of red crystal that hums faintly (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to punish those who have wronged or defied her.
- **P48d** This chamber is empty. A short staircase leads up to area P48c. A longer staircase leads down to a hallway on the palace's lower level that connects with areas P14d and P16.
- **P48e** Characters can reach this chamber by climbing a staircase from a hallway on the palace's lower level that stretches north of area P29. An enameled green coffer rests on a wrought-iron pedestal in the middle of the room. The coffer contains a faintly glowing, plum-sized jewel of green crystal (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to remain hidden from her enemies.
- **P48f** Characters can reach this chamber by climbing a short staircase from area P48g. An enameled black coffer rests on a pedestal of living vines in the middle of the room. The coffer contains a plum-sized jewel made of lustrous black crystal (see "Treasure" below). Any character who grasps the jewel and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check intuits that the jewel is Zybilna's crystallized desire to know what her enemies are plotting.
- **P48g** This chamber is empty. A short staircase leads up to area P48f. A longer staircase leads down to area P14a on the palace's lower level.

***Treasure.*** The five jewels stored in the turrets are Zybilna's crystallized desires. They appeared to her shortly after the domain of Prismeer was formed, and she placed them in the turrets for safekeeping. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around each jewel.

An *identify* spell or similar magic reveals that each jewel has a single *conjure fey* spell embedded in it, and that the spell can be cast as an action by knocking the jewel three times against a hard object or surface. No other components are required to cast the spell, and there's no way for the user to know what creature will appear. The creature summoned by a jewel depends on the jewel's color, as noted in the Conjured Fey table. The jewel vanishes when the creature appears, and the creature disappears after 1 hour. See the *conjure fey* spell description for the creature's behavior.

These conjured Fey are magically created duplicates of creatures whose life essence Zybilna harvested to twist part of the Feywild into what would become her Domain of Delight. Being mere echoes, they are oblivious to this fact and unaware of what they truly are. Each one acts as though it has been imprisoned in its jewel for an unknown period of time (by whom, it can't say). It doesn't realize that it will cease to exist when the spell that brought it forth ends.

##### Conjured Fey
| Jewel | Creature |
|:---:|---|
| Black | Spymaster Hushknife, a **darkling elder** (see *appendix C*) |
| Blue | Allegra, a **quickling** (see *appendix C*) |
| Green | Frogspittle, a **green hag** |
| Red | Sinch the Ruthless, a **redcap** (see *appendix C*) |
| White | Winky, a one-eyed **blink dog** |

#### P49. Black Book
The door to this chamber is sealed with a hart crown lock (see "Crown Locks" earlier in the chapter).

>>The walls, floor, and ceiling of this room are made of white marble tiles. In the middle of the room, a quill with a feather sheathed in flame and a black-covered book rest on an iron lectern.
>>

The book and the quill radiate auras of abjuration magic if scrutinized using a *detect magic* spell or similar magic. The flame coming off the feather is illusory and harmless.

The front cover of the book is embossed with images of a lion and a hart, the two animals rearing up on their hind legs and facing each other. Any creature whose name is written in the book using the quill can open any of the palace's crown locks. If a creature's name is crossed out using the quill, or the page bearing its name is torn from the book, the creature's ability to open these locks is rescinded.

A long list of names fills the book's pages, many of them belonging to fairies, judging by their colorfulness. The hags of the Hourglass Coven are listed near the middle of the book. Other names in the book include **Thinnings** (Zybilna's butler), Shon (Zybilna's librarian), Kalimanzaros (Zybilna's clerk), and **Raezil** Uthemar (Zybilna's elf spy in area P31). The final few names are written in **Endelyn Moongrave**'s handwriting. These last entries are the members of the League of Malevolence: **Kelek**, **Zarak**, **Zargash**, **Warduke**, and **Skylla**.

#### P50. Vault

>>An ornate iron door stands at the top of the staircase. Its surface is covered with a complex array of cogs, latches, and tumblers. The round doorknob is engraved with the image of a nightingale.
>>

Zybilna stores her greatest treasures inside this vault, which is shielded against divination magic. The door is impervious to damage and has eight built-in locking mechanisms, any one of which can be affected by a *knock* spell or similar magic. A character can also spend 1 minute trying to pick one of the locks by using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check. Opening a single lock, however, causes any previously opened locks to close. To enter the vault, all eight locks must be opened at the same time.

Characters who examine the doorknob discover an inscription around its base that reads, "Speak My Name." A creature that speaks the password "Natasha" while grasping the doorknob can open all of the locks simultaneously. The door, once opened, locks automatically when it is closed again. A similar doorknob, but without the inscription, is inside the vault.

The jars of time (area P44) and the costume room (area P36) can provide hints about Zybilna's earliest identity. The solution to this riddle is also hidden in the border of the Witchlight Carnival poster map, which incorporates drawings of creatures and objects pointing at one another: a nilbog (goblin jester) points its scepter at an almiraj (a horned rabbit), which points its horn at a treant, which points to an arrow that points toward a swan, whose beak points to a hippogriff pointing at an axe. By taking the first letters of these creatures and objects, the name NATASHA is spelled out. Reward any player who figures this out by having that player's character whisper the name as if conjuring it from some half-forgotten childhood dream.

When the door opens, read:

>>The door swings open to reveal a circular chamber illuminated by drifting balls of colored light. In the middle of the room, a finely forged greatsword floats, point upward, three feet above a treasure chest. The magic that holds the sword aloft also rotates it slowly, so that the blade catches and reflects the multicolored lights.
>>

The chest is not locked. The drifting balls of light are harmless magical effects confined to this room.

***Treasure.*** The greatsword is *Snicker-Snack* (see *appendix A*). The levitation effect that keeps it aloft ends when the sword is held or moved.

The chest contains the following items:

- *Snicker-Snack*'s ornate scabbard, adorned with phoenix feathers (100 gp)
- A gold helmet decorated with hart antlers (250 gp)
- A shimmering silver cloak, with a unicorn embroidered on it in platinum thread (750 gp)

#### P51. Beanstalk Tower
To enter this tower, the characters must use flight or climb the beanstalk that supports it (see area P17).

>>The interior of the tower is a mess of broken furniture and grasping vines. Amid the ruins, a toad wearing a tiny wizard's cape perches on the lid of a treasure chest that has slid into a wall and become surrounded by junk.
>>

The toad is Iggrik, a shapechanged **quasit** and Iggwilv's longtime companion. It addresses the characters in Common and claims to be Zybilna's toad familiar. If attacked, it assumes the form of a bat and flies away, taking refuge in the garden (area P2).

When the palace was frozen in time, Iggrik was in the library (area P28). It spied on the Hourglass Coven until the hags left the palace, then used a potion from Zybilna's laboratory to cause the beanstalk to lift this tower into the air, creating a haven for itself. The quasit has been hiding ever since. It knows that the League of Malevolence has sided with the hags against Zybilna, but it lacks the courage to venture forth and remain abreast of the league's activities in the palace. **Warduke**, in particular, terrifies the quasit.

If the characters mention Iggwilv or Natasha, Iggrik tries to redirect the conversation. If the characters are otherwise fishing for information, Iggrik reveals the following helpful tidbits:

- The vault (area P50) contains a vorpal sword that can slay the jabberwock. Zybilna acquired the sword as a precaution, in case the jabberwock turned against her. (If the characters ask about the vault's defenses, Iggrik describes a locked door that requires a password, which he knows but won't automatically divulge.)
- The jabberwock is not the biggest creature living in the palace. That would be Zybilna's enormous owl, Bloodybeak. It hates the jabberwock but is confined to the aviary (area P20) and frozen in time. The password to open the aviary's windows is "canzus."
- Guests can bypass the crown locks on the palace doors by writing their names into Zybilna's black book (in area P49).

Iggrik also knows how to end the curse that Iggwilv placed on the *Ioun stone* in area P33. If the characters need help ending the curse, Iggrik tells them how if they correctly answer the following riddle: "Yesterday comes after tomorrow, but where's my proof?" The answer is "in a dictionary."

If the characters tell Iggrik that Zybilna can be freed from temporal stasis by speaking her true name while touching her with a unicorn horn, the quasit reveals that Zybilna's true name is Natasha (see also "Unicorn Horn" below).

If Iggrik learns that everyone in the palace can be released from temporal stasis by destroying *Iggwilv's Cauldron*, the quasit shares the following information:

- A *flame tongue* weapon can destroy the cauldron, and **Warduke** happens to wield such a weapon.
- The jabberwock likes to coil around the cauldron when it sleeps and is attracted to music. The best chance of defeating it is to use *Snicker-Snack*, the vorpal sword in Iggwilv's vault (area P50). The password to unlock the vault is "Natasha."
- Destroying the cauldron is no great loss, since Iggwilv has the power to repair it. (That's not to say that the Witch Queen will be pleased to see her cauldron destroyed.)

***Treasure.*** The treasure chest contains a pair of *winged boots*, which Iggrik offers to the characters if they promise to free Zybilna.

***Unicorn Horn.*** If the *Story Tracker* indicates that the unicorn horn is here, Iggrik found the horn and placed it in the chest with the *winged boots*. Once Iggrik learns that the horn has the power to release creatures trapped in temporal stasis, the quasit offers the horn to characters who promise to use it to free its mistress.

## Ending the Story
Releasing Zybilna from temporal stasis can be accomplished in one of three ways:

- Shattering *Iggwilv's Cauldron* with a *frost brand* or *flame tongue* weapon (see the cauldron's description in *appendix A* for details), which ends the time-freezing magic throughout the palace.
- Touching *Iggwilv's Cauldron* with a unicorn horn while reciting a poem called "The Witch Queen's Cauldron" (see area P22), which also ends the time-freezing magic throughout the palace.
- Touching Zybilna with a unicorn horn while speaking her true name, Natasha, which can be learned in the palace's costume room (area P36), from Iggrik the quasit (see area P51), or from the family tree in Loomlurch (see area L11 in *chapter 3*). Once she is freed, Zybilna can use the horn, the poem, and the cauldron to break the spell on the rest of the palace, as described in area P22.

## Zybilna Comes Alive
If Zybilna is freed from temporal stasis, read:

>>Once more able to move, Zybilna lurches forward a step, then quickly regains her balance.
>>
>>"Damn. Too late!" she says with a snarl.
>>
>>Her eyes dart around in search of enemies before fixing on you. "Have we met?" she asks.
>>

**Iggwilv the Witch Queen** (see the accompanying stat block) gives the characters time to explain themselves, hanging on their every word. If you used the Warlock's Quest adventure hook and one or more characters have childhood memories of Zybilna, it dawns on Iggwilv that she has met those characters before and gives them a knowing look.

Zybilna/Iggwilv is troubled to learn of what has happened to Prismeer and vows to undo the damage the Hourglass Coven has wrought—a task that will take considerable time and effort. If the characters have unfinished business with the Hourglass Coven, the archfey reveals to them the weaknesses of all three hags and allows the characters to deal with the coven as they see fit (see "Fate of the Hourglass Coven" below). *Appendix D* has additional roleplaying notes for Zybilna.

![[104-637677440418909361.png|right|300]]

### Things Best Left Unsaid
If the characters speak to Zybilna/Iggwilv about her past, her mood suddenly darkens:

>>The archfey's hair turns from white to raven-black, and she appears younger and angrier now than she was a moment ago. "You know nothing about my past!" she snaps. "The wars I've won, the enemies I've crushed. I've turned the hourglass on its end so many times. Each turn is a new beginning. Who are you that stands before me and speaks of things best unspoken?"
>>

Ask the players in turn what, if anything, their characters try to do to quell the archfey's anger, then have the characters make a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) group check. Add 1 to the DC for each dretch in area P37 that the characters killed. Any characters who deliberately stoke her anger, or who say or do nothing, automatically get failures on their checks.

On a successful group check, Zybilna/Iggwilv apologizes for her outburst, and her mood lightens. On a failed group check, the archfey erases all knowledge of Iggwilv and Natasha from the characters' memories before continuing the conversation as if nothing had happened. Inform the players that this effect has occurred—the names Iggwilv and Natasha no longer mean anything to their characters, and their characters are unaware of what Zybilna has just done. As far as the characters are concerned, Zybilna is the archfey who rules Prismeer and has no other past identities. The effect is permanent and irreversible.

Various loose ends are addressed in the sections that follow. Some of the events described in these sections require the characters' involvement, while others can play out in their absence.

### Fate of the Hourglass Coven
If all three hags of the Hourglass Coven are dead, there's nothing more to be done with them. This section discusses what happens next if Zybilna is set free and at least one of the hags is still alive.

The surviving hags can sense when Zybilna is released from temporal stasis—or, rather, they can sense when their hold over Prismeer is lost. The instant Zybilna regains control of her domain, the hags use their *plane shift* spells to flee to Gehenna, where they maintain a cramped tower guarded by yugoloth mercenaries. They don't think that Zybilna is aware of the tower, but her spies learned about it some time ago. She reveals the tower's location to characters who want to conclude their dealings with the hags or perhaps put an end to them. The tower in Gehenna is beyond the scope of this adventure; flesh out its occupants and defenses as you see fit if the characters decide to pay the hags a visit.

Zybilna takes no immediate action against the surviving hags, preferring to let them stew in exile. If all three hags are still alive, the coven stays together even though its members constantly blame one another for their failures. The hags are united by their fear of Zybilna's wrath, and they live in torment, dreading the day when Zybilna seeks them out and inflicts punishment on them for their wickedness.

### Valor's Call and the League of Malevolence
The heroes of Valor's Call become distressed if they learn that Zybilna and Iggwilv are one and the same. They know Iggwilv only by her reputation as a villain, but they have allied with Zybilna against the League of Malevolence. That alliance persists, at least until the league is destroyed and its surviving members taken into custody. Zybilna offers to send Valor's Call and their prisoners back to the Material Plane, after which Valor's Call and Iggwilv go their separate ways.

League members who are still at large in the palace try to flee as soon as the time-freezing magic on the palace ends, for they know Zybilna will not forgive them for their treachery. If the characters rescued **Strongheart**, the merciful knight sets out to track down and capture the remaining members of the league, whereas the other members of Valor's Call would just as soon dispose of them. If you want to use the League of Malevolence in future adventures, allowing one or more of its members to escape means they can show up again later in your campaign. The league might also have other members whom the characters have yet to encounter.

### Stolen Treasures
In accordance with the rule of ownership (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*), Zybilna won't allow characters to keep *Iggwilv's Cauldron* or the vorpal sword, *Snicker-Snack*. The characters can keep any other treasures they acquired in her domain, but only because she chooses to bequeath these items to them.

### Lost Children
As beings of unfettered emotion and potential, children are of great importance to Zybilna. The archfey sees to it that any children held captive by the Hourglass Coven are liberated, rid of unhappy memories, and escorted back to their homes by pixie courtiers. The same holds true for any children who were sequestered by Zybilna's protective magic (see "Children of Prismeer" in *chapter 2*).

### Madryck's Reward
If you used the "Warlock's Quest" adventure hook, the characters might want to contact their employer, Madryck Roslof, and let him know that Zybilna is well. If she is asked, Zybilna is willing to convey a message to Madryck so that the characters don't have to rush home with the news.

Characters who waste no time getting back to Madryck find him safe at home, still clinging to life. Madryck upholds his end of the agreement by giving them the key and the directions to his buried hoard (see "Madryck's Treasure" in the *introduction*).

## Zybilna's Gifts
Honoring the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct" in *chapter 2*), Zybilna offers her rescuers a gift. The nature of this gift depends on whether or not the characters destroyed her magnificent cauldron.

### The Cauldron Was Destroyed
If *Iggwilv's Cauldron* was destroyed but all its pieces are recovered, Zybilna uses a *wish* spell to repair the artifact. If this turn of events occurs, read:

>>Zybilna beholds the pieces of the cauldron and says, "I wish my cauldron were made whole again." Motes of colored light swirl around the fragments as they rise into the air and snap together like pieces of a puzzle. The cracks and seams between them gradually vanish as the cauldron is restored. Zybilna puts one hand on its lip, and the cauldron transforms before your eyes. Dull iron turns to gleaming gold, and what was once a fearsome sight to behold now looks wondrous beyond compare.
>>

The archfey commands her pixie courtiers to bring enough water and wine to put the gold cauldron to use; Zybilna uses that time to attune to the cauldron so that she can exercise its magical properties for the characters' benefit. See *appendix A* for information about what *Iggwilv's Cauldron* can do in its gold form.

***Dead Dretches.*** If the characters slew three or more of the **dretches** in area P37, Zybilna is not feeling so generous. She uses the *scrying* property of the gold cauldron for the characters' benefit only once before sending them away.

### The Cauldron Was Saved
If her cauldron was not destroyed, Zybilna offers her rescuers the use of a *wish* spell in return for their accomplishments:

>>"As a reward, I offer you one free casting of a *wish* spell. Tell me, what is your hearts' desire?"
>>

Zybilna honors the spirit of the characters' request and doesn't try to twist their words. If the characters want to be returned to their home world, Zybilna uses a *wish* spell to transport them back to the Witchlight Carnival or wherever else they want to go, wiser and perhaps not a day older than when they entered the Feywild. If they wish for something else, Zybilna satisfies that desire as well as she can, given the limits of the spell.

If Zybilna can provide what the characters desire without casting a *wish* spell, so much the better. For example, if they want to take her flying coach (in area P11) and explore more of the Feywild, she gives them the coach and its key before seeing them on their merry way. If they ask for her cauldron, she laughs and says, "Not in this lifetime."

***Dead Dretches.*** If the characters slew three or more of the dretches in area P37, Zybilna is not feeling so generous. She grants the characters' wish to return home, but nothing else.

### To Be Young Again!
If you used the "Lost Things" adventure hook and the characters are granted a wish, Zybilna offers to harness the time-dilating power of the Feywild to send the characters back to their home plane as the children they once were, so that they can live their lives over without having suffered the terrible losses that brought them to Prismeer in the first place. (This use of Zybilna's gift tests the boundary of what a *wish* spell can do but is nevertheless within the archfey's power.) This choice is a fine option if the players want to "retire" their characters and end the campaign here and now. If all the players accept this option, read:

>>You close your eyes, and the world shifts around you. The music of a calliope draws you back to reality. The cool evening air is filled with the sweet smell of candy and the fragrances of autumn. You and your childhood friends skip down the path toward the Witchlight Carnival, clutching golden tickets in your little hands.
>>

The adventure ends here, right where it started.

# Factions
This appendix describes three factions that appear in the adventure: the Hourglass Coven, the League of Malevolence, and Valor's Call.

## Hourglass Coven
The Hourglass Coven is a group of three hags, each one bound to an aspect of time: one reflects the past, another reflects the present, and the third reflects the future. These hags are utter wickedness distilled into corporeal forms, driven by a lust for secrets that can be used to manipulate their prey.

**Skabatha Nightshade**, **Bavlorna Blightstraw**, and **Endelyn Moongrave** are daughters of Baba Yaga. The three became wild with jealousy when Iggwilv, Baba Yaga's adopted daughter, surpassed them in power and carved out a Feywild domain for herself in the guise of an archfey named Zybilna. The hags wormed their way into Iggwilv's good graces, biding their time until they could wrest the domain from her clutches. They waited until Iggwilv was lured away on an important matter to imbue *Iggwilv's Cauldron* with the ability to freeze time. When their sister returned, the hags used this power to trap Iggwilv and her court in temporal stasis. The hags then carved up Iggwilv's domain, splitting it between them. The sisters couldn't agree on which of them should keep *Iggwilv's Cauldron*, so they left it in Iggwilv's palace and hired some unscrupulous mercenaries to watch over it.

The hags loathe each other's company, but one hag will occasionally visit another to plot against the third sister, creating a vicious circle in which Bavlorna and Endelyn plot against Skabatha, Endelyn and Skabatha conspire against Bavlorna, and Skabatha and Bavlorna bedevil Endelyn. Nothing much ever comes of these petty plots and squabbles, however.

> ##### Shared Spells of the Hourglass Coven
>On the rare occasions when all three hags of the Hourglass Coven are within 30 feet of one another, any one of them can use an action to cast one of the following spells, requiring no material components (spell save DC 14): *detect thoughts*, *dispel magic*, *finger of death*, *glibness*, *locate creature*, *mass suggestion*.
>
>Once a spell from this list has been cast, no member of the coven can cast that shared spell again until the next dawn, when the coven regains all of its shared spells.
>

### Bavlorna Blightstraw
Younger than Skabatha and older than Endelyn, Bavlorna is called Slack-jawed Lorna because her wide mouth is prone to hang agape. Flies flit in and out of it. She is the hag of the present, the here and now, the moment to moment. Those desperate individuals who seek her out do so to find a remedy for a nagging problem or anxiety. Though she despises unannounced visitors, a tragic tale of woe and misery puts her in a bargaining mood. If these visitors enter into an agreement with Bavlorna, she'll use her powers to resolve their pressing problem in exchange for something of use to her.

***Alignment.*** Neutral evil.

***Personality Trait.*** "I detest chores and would rather have other creatures do them for me."

***Ideal.*** "I don't care about the past or the future. I live in the present. What I do now, this very moment, is all that matters."

***Bond.*** "I'm safe in my cottage. Why should I leave it when I can make others come to me?"

***Flaw.*** "Watching someone run widdershins makes me sneeze uncontrollably."

#### Bavlorna's Appearance
Bavlorna has a toad-like face with a mouth that magically widens and elongates, enabling her to swallow creatures whole. Her bulging eyes move independently, constantly scanning her surroundings. Stained and moldering patchwork garments hide much of the leathery, mummified flesh that stretches over Bavlorna's compact frame and extraordinarily long, spindly limbs. She must submerge herself in a briny concoction for an hour each day, or her body will dry out until it locks up in a kind of living rictus, and she remains that way until submerged. As the hours pass between each immersion, her movements become more ponderous and her skin audibly cracks as she moves.

Bavlorna lives like a hermit. She is frazzled, impatient, paranoid, and vindictive, lashing out at anyone she thinks is trying to deprive her of the treasures she has tucked away in her cottage. She trusts no one, so she creates tiny duplicates of herself, called lornlings, to serve as her attendants. When she travels away from her lair, she does so on her *bobbing lily pad* (see *appendix A*), accompanied by lornlings, which use the **quickling** stat block in *appendix C*.

#### Bavlorna's Weakness
Bavlorna is allergic to the sight of creatures running counterclockwise in circles, a motion known as "running widdershins." Creatures that run widdershins within 10 feet of Bavlorna cause her to lapse into a fit of sneezing. See the stat block for more details.

![[114-637677436598601233.png|right|300]]

### Endelyn Moongrave
Endelyn, also known by the names Creeping Lyn and Bitter End, is the youngest member of the Hourglass Coven. People come to her to learn about their futures, which she spells out through grotesque theatrical pageants. As payment, she snatches away a portion of each client's free will, preventing them from taking certain courses of action in their lives. Her petitioners often learn of a dreadful fate that awaits them but find themselves unable to prevent it due to the cursed terms of their deal.

Endelyn's obsession with tragedy and hopelessness extends to her own life; she has foreseen her own demise during a solar eclipse. In the depths of her castle, a lightning-powered device called the Orrery of Tragedies clicks and turns day and night, giving Endelyn glimpses of her terrible fate.

***Alignment.*** Neutral evil.

***Personality Trait.*** "I have foreseen not only this moment but the next as well. Nothing surprises me."

***Ideal.*** "Each of us gets to play the lead in our own tragedy, but if you can't be bothered to put on a good show before you die, don't waste my time."

***Bond.*** "My world is the stage, and my theater is of paramount importance to me."

***Flaw.*** "My death will occur during an eclipse. That is my doom, and I can't change it, but I will do everything in my power to forestall it."

#### Endelyn's Appearance
Endelyn's emaciated form is hidden under the layers of her elaborate costume. Part dress, part mechanical theater, the outfit makes her look frighteningly tall; without it, she is a hunched and withered bag of bones. She shrouds her wrinkled features behind a gauzy "theater curtain" veil. The outermost layers of her dress open to reveal a marionette theatre, and she manipulates her puppets using an arrangement of artificial hands that nestles in the folds of fabric. She travels about Yon on her *ornithopter of flying* (see *appendix A*).

#### Endelyn's Weakness
The only way to dispose of Endelyn for good is to slay her during an actual solar eclipse or in the presence of a symbolic depiction of one. See the stat block for details.

![[115-637677438816391091.png|right|300]]

### Skabatha Nightshade
Skabatha is the oldest member of the Hourglass Coven. Better known as Granny Nightshade, she offers her assistance to those who are haunted by regret. Her deals often result in cruel twists; for example, a petitioner who asks to be reunited with a lost love might be transformed into one of their loved one's cherished items, such as a favorite bonnet.

Skabatha assumes the guise of an old toymaker. Part toy herself, she has a windup key between her hunched shoulders that rotates quickly when she's in a good mood and slows down as her mood sours. When she is furious, the key comes to a dead stop.

***Alignment.*** Neutral evil.

***Personality Trait.*** "When dealing with outsiders, I present myself as a kindly old grandmother."

***Ideal.*** "Children are better off working for me than picking up lots of bad habits."

***Bond.*** "I hate my sisters, but together we are strong."

***Flaw.*** "I forget the first creature I see each day when I awaken."

#### Skabatha's Appearance
Skabatha appears as a short, thin, gnarled woman swathed in a tattered dress with petticoats. Cracked white face paint plasters her features, with crimson splotches on her cheeks and thick mascara coating her sparse eyelashes. Underneath her makeup, her flesh is textured like rotten bark and infested with wood lice and fungus. The windup key sticking out of her back is a part of her body and no easier to remove than one of her limbs. Skabatha roams Thither on her **flying rocking horse** (see *chapter 3* for its stat block), which creaks horribly as it moves.

#### Skabatha's Weakness
Skabatha always forgets the first creature she sees when she awakens after a long rest. See the stat block for details.

![[116-637677444778104171.png|right|300]]

## League of Malevolence
The League of Malevolence is an odious assemblage of villains united in one purpose: the accumulation of power. Its founding member, the sorcerer **Kelek**, expects his confederates to work together for their mutual benefit, but he also encourages them to pursue their own evil schemes.

Five members of the league, including **Kelek**, are described here, although one member (**Skylla**) has recently parted ways with the others.

### Kelek
**Kelek** is a greedy, narcissistic sociopath who revels in chaos but is a coward at heart. The fact that he's highly intelligent makes him even more dangerous. More than anything, he wants the *staff of power* in the possession of his most hated foe, **Ringlerun** (described later in this appendix).

***Alignment.*** Chaotic evil.

***Personality Trait.*** "All who hear my name should tremble in fear!"

***Ideal.*** "Kindness is just another word for weakness."

***Bond.*** "I must have **Ringlerun**'s staff! With it, the League of Malevolence will be unstoppable!"

***Flaw.*** "I trust no one, nor am I trustworthy."

#### Combat Notes
**Kelek** uses Arcane Defense to bolster his low Armor Class whenever possible, and his challenge rating is a reflection of the likelihood that he will use Fiery Explosion as often as he can. If one or more of his allies get caught in a blast, so be it.

![[117-637677441242369173.png|right|300]]

### Skylla
**Skylla**, who sometimes goes by the alias Charmay, forged a warlock's pact with Baba Yaga. It is from this powerful archfey that **Skylla** draws her magic.

**Skylla** is spiteful and treacherous, as likely to betray her allies as to help them. She talked **Kelek** into allowing her to serve as the primary liaison between the League of Malevolence and the Hourglass Coven, claiming her pact with Baba Yaga made her better suited for the role than anyone else.

**Endelyn Moongrave** foresaw that **Skylla**'s allies would turn on her one day and shared this information with the warlock. **Skylla** reacted to that news by distancing herself from the League of Malevolence, and now she works for Endelyn. **Skylla** is open to the idea of rejoining the league, but not while **Kelek** is in charge.

***Alignment.*** Chaotic evil.

***Personality Trait.*** "Only a fool would turn their back on me."

***Ideal.*** "Power is what I crave. One can never have too much of it."

***Bond.*** "Baba Yaga is my patron, and she has taught me to be self-reliant. Nevertheless, I feel beholden to stay on good terms with her vile spawn, the hags of the Hourglass Coven."

***Flaw.*** "I don't have a single friend I can count on."

#### Combat Notes
**Skylla** is not an effective melee combatant. She is more dangerous when she can use magic from a safe distance. She can also use her *faerie fire* spell to make foes easier for her allies to hit.

![[118-637677445160826484.png|right|300]]

### Warduke
**Warduke**'s services as a remorseless killer-for-hire can be easily bought. The evil swordsman serves **Kelek** as a cohort and adventuring companion from time to time. He isn't terribly bright, which is why he leaves the plotting and scheming to others.

What does **Warduke** look like under his *dread helm*? No one knows. He never removes his helmet to reveal his face to others, but the visage beneath it is that of a grim, hideously scarred gladiator.

***Alignment.*** Chaotic evil.

***Personality Trait.*** "I speak with the flames and razor-sharp edges of my sword. They beat words to hell."

***Ideal.*** "I expect to be paid well for my handiwork."

***Bond.*** "The League of Malevolence is a convenient arrangement—until something better comes along."

***Flaw.*** "I would rather die than surrender."

#### Combat Notes
**Warduke** likes to hit things with his sword; it's as simple as that.

![[119-637677446687763135.png|right|300]]

### Zarak
**Zarak** is an assassin without honor or conscience. Unusually short of stature for someone of orcish heritage, he might pass for an ugly, beardless dwarf were it not for his rotting tusks and grayish pallor. The only thing he loves is money, and he wouldn't hesitate to stab allies in the back if they came between him and the riches he covets.

***Alignment.*** Chaotic evil.

***Personality Trait.*** "I mince people, not words."

***Ideal.*** "Coin is what I crave."

***Bond.*** "Once I agree to kill something, I pursue my quarry until the job is done."

***Flaw.*** "A friend is just an enemy I haven't made yet."

#### Combat Notes
When faced with multiple foes, **Zarak** prefers to hurl daggers from a distance. When targeting a lone individual, especially someone he has been hired to kill, he prefers the up-close-and-personal garrote, so that he can hear the dying breath of his hapless prey. If defeat seems likely, he quaffs his *potion of invisibility* and flees.

![[120-637677446966894394.png|right|300]]

### Zargash
**Zargash** worships Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath, who has promised to transform **Zargash** into a vampire after a lifetime of faithful service. For a living priest to worship Orcus is utter folly, but **Zargash** is twisted beyond any hope of redemption. His hobbies include slaying the living and animating the dead.

***Alignment.*** Chaotic evil.

***Personality Trait.*** "I do not fear death, for when I die, Orcus will transform me into a vampire."

***Ideal.*** "Entropy is not simply the bane of existence. It's the doom of the multiverse. My job is to speed it along."

***Bond.*** "Praise Orcus! May he give me the power to spread death, decay, and undeath in his name!"

***Flaw.*** "I see living people as the corpses they are doomed to become and treat them accordingly."

#### Combat Notes
War is **Zargash**'s domain. He wears a rusty chain shirt under his robe and likes to thwart enemy spellcasters by enveloping them in the area of a *silence* spell. If defeat seems inevitable, he casts *gaseous form* on himself and flees, leaving his allies to fend for themselves.

![[121-637677447207404330.png|right|300]]

## Valor's Call
The noble adventuring party known as Valor's Call was founded by **Strongheart**, a resolute human paladin committed to destroying evil wherever it rears its ugly head. **Strongheart** alone determines who can become a member of this prestigious group, which has more members than those described here. (The other members, who do not appear in this adventure, are busy elsewhere.) **Strongheart** is always on the lookout for courageous heroes who are willing to devote themselves to a good cause. Only good-aligned characters are allowed to join Valor's Call.

### Elkhorn
**Elkhorn** has been **Strongheart**'s most stalwart companion over the years—unflinchingly loyal, tirelessly optimistic, and fiercely devoted to the destruction of evil in all its forms. He's not especially bright, so he fights with his heart rather than his wits.

Age has drained much of the strength from **Elkhorn**'s body. **Strongheart** has urged **Elkhorn** to retire, but the old dwarf stubbornly refuses to do so.

***Alignment.*** Lawful good.

***Personality Trait.*** "As long as I have the strength in my bones to fight evil, that is what I will do."

***Ideal.*** "One who stands idle as evil remains unchecked is no friend or ally of mine. We all have an obligation to fight atrocity and corruption, to whatever extent we can."

***Bond.*** "**Strongheart** is a good egg, but I have yet to teach him all I know about being a true menace to evildoers."

***Flaw.*** "Retire? My goodness, no. I'll retire when I'm dead."

#### Combat Notes
**Elkhorn**'s challenge rating is based on him using Feint to improve his rather weak sword attack. Having been trained in his youth to fight ogres and trolls, he's much more dangerous against creatures that are significantly bigger than he is.

### Mercion
**Mercion** strikes the balance of a natural leader and a protective caregiver. She has a direct manner that reassures and inspires those around her.

**Mercion** does not worship a deity, but rather an ideal: that truth gives life to artistry and beauty, and that those who embrace deceit should be censured and punished. Light is her domain.

***Alignment.*** Lawful good.

***Personality Trait.*** "No one dies on my watch—unless they stand against what I hold dear."

***Ideal.*** "Truth begets art and beauty, while deceit does nothing but tear the fabric of our souls."

***Bond.*** "Evildoers beware! Valor's Call is coming for you."

***Flaw.*** "My friends would say I'm inflexible. The truth is, I like things done a certain way."

#### Combat Notes
**Mercion** counts on her armor to protect her as she administers healing. She uses Radiant Fire against groups of foes when there's no chance of harming allies or innocent lives, otherwise resorting to *hold person* spells and Divine Radiance attacks.

### Molliver
**Molliver** is a thief who gives most of what they steal to the destitute, keeping a few choice items for their own use. They're always ready to put themself in harm's way to see justice triumph over tyranny and inequality.

**Molliver** invites trouble by not thinking through the ramifications of their actions, counting on their friends to bail them out whenever they get in over their head. They always have a friendly jibe or acerbic remark on the tip of their tongue, and their cavalier attitude doesn't always sit well with their more cautious companions.

***Alignment.*** Chaotic good.

***Personality Trait.*** "I'm a bit rash, to put it mildly."

***Ideal.*** "I have no tolerance for bullies and tyrants."

***Bond.*** "The brigganocks of Yon are my trusted friends. They need someone to protect them, and I happily volunteer."

***Flaw.*** "My impatience sometimes demands that I strike out on my own while my comrades-in-arms waste time deliberating."

#### Combat Notes
**Molliver** likes to get up close and personal in fights. If they're caught in a tight spot, they try to use their *boots of levitation* to escape.

### Ringlerun
**Ringlerun** became an adventurer to better satisfy his craving for arcane knowledge. One of his adventures took him into an underwater tomb, where he tricked a marid into surrendering a *staff of power*. This staff greatly increased **Ringlerun**'s capabilities and made him the **envy** of many rival spellcasters.

**Ringlerun** has a good heart, but he's easily distracted by intellectual pursuits. He would rather spend time in quiet contemplation or reading than in frivolous conversation.

***Alignment.*** Lawful good.

***Personality Trait.*** "Don't talk to me. I'm reading."

***Ideal.*** "Magic belongs only in the hands of those who use it for noble ends."

***Bond.*** "My *staff of power* dramatically enhances my magical abilities. I shudder to think how its power could be abused in the wrong hands."

***Flaw.*** "I get prickly when people who are clearly less intelligent want to tell me what to do."

#### Combat Notes
**Ringlerun** can fend off melee attackers with wild swings of his staff, but he prefers to fly out of reach and attack at range using his staff's formidable spells (*cone of cold* being his favorite).

### Strongheart
**Strongheart** is a fearless seeker of justice, risking his life to ensure that good triumphs over evil. He is thoughtful, kind, and seldom rash, yet never hesitant to punish those who spit in the face of law and order.

**Strongheart** doesn't worship a god but devotes himself to an ideal: that the world can be spared from evil by those who have enough courage to stand against it.

***Alignment.*** Lawful good.

***Personality Trait.*** "I try to see the good in people, but I won't give comfort to those who have no goodness in them."

***Ideal.*** "Justice needs champions. I count myself as one."

***Bond.*** "Valor's Call is not just an assembly of like-minded individuals who believe that good must triumph over evil. Its members are also my friends."

***Flaw.*** "I am prepared—my friends might say too prepared—to sacrifice myself for the greatest good."

#### Combat Notes
**Strongheart** prefers to fight with *Steel*, his trusty sword. His favorite use of the *command* spell is to compel a foe to "Yield!" (which has the same effect as commanding it to halt). He tries to capture and imprison evildoers, slaying them only if they cannot be apprehended.
