# Introduction
Something evil is trapping the souls of the dead and draining life from all who have been raised from death by magic. This worldwide "death curse" not only prevents the raising of the dead but also causes creatures that were previously raised from the dead to wither and die. The source of this death curse lies in a trap-riddled tomb hidden beneath a lost city in the depths of a vast jungle.

*Tomb of Annihilation* is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure that takes place on the peninsula of Chult in the Forgotten Realms. Chult is a tropical wilderness composed mostly of jungles, plateaus, impassable mountains, and belching volcanoes. You can substitute a different jungle setting, changing location names as needed. Alternative D&D settings include the Amedio Jungle of Oerth, the Savage Coast of Mystara, the jungles of Xen'drik on Eberron, or a comparable setting on your home campaign world.

This adventure is designed to begin with a party of four to six 1st-level characters, who should advance to 11th level or higher by the adventure's conclusion.

## Story Overview
The characters are drawn into the story by **Syndra Silvane**, a retired adventurer and merchant who, years ago, was raised from the dead. Now, she's withering away. When she consulted priests, Syndra learned that the affliction was widespread and that no spell could cure it. She spoke to her friends among the Harpers, who determined the source of the affliction: an ungodly necromantic device called the Soulmonger. The Harpers received their intelligence from a lich, but they don't know much about the Soulmonger other than its name and general whereabouts. Adventurers willing to help Syndra must travel to Chult, a land of jungles and monsters, to find the Soulmonger and destroy it.

Unknown to Syndra and her allies, the Soulmonger is trapping the souls of the dead and depriving liches of the means to trap souls in their phylacteries. (The Soulmonger snatches up the souls before they can be trapped elsewhere.) Szass Tam, the most powerful lich among the Red Wizards of Thay, has sent operatives to Chult to steal the Soulmonger or, failing that, destroy it. Leading the Thayan expedition is Szass Tam's devoted lieutenant, **Valindra Shadowmantle**. Valindra has been warned that adventurers might cross her path, so she's prepared for them.

Also lurking in the heart of Chult is **Ras Nsi**, a mythic, villainous figure among Chultans. **Ras Nsi** was a human paladin and a sworn protector of the city of Mezro. He betrayed his oaths and was banished. Rather than redeem himself, he raised an undead army to conquer Mezro. The would-be tyrant was defeated and banished once more. Mezro was later destroyed by the Spellplague (or so it seemed), during which **Ras Nsi** lost his power to create and command undead. He withdrew to the city of Omu, leaving the vestiges of his undead army to roam unchecked throughout the jungle. That was not the end of **Ras Nsi**, however. Bitter over his loss of power, he forged an alliance with the yuan-ti lurking in the ruins of Omu and underwent a ritual of transformation, becoming a yuan-ti malison. As a yuan-ti, **Ras Nsi** imposed his terrible will on the evil snake people and became their leader.

Beneath the cracked and broken streets of Omu lies a secret yuan-ti temple called the Fane of the Night Serpent, where **Ras Nsi** holds sway and plots to bring about the end of the world. Omu is also home to the Tomb of the Nine Gods. As the characters explore this multilevel dungeon, they encounter the spirits of Omu's trickster gods and are potentially inhabited by them. Each god embodies a different alignment, and any character inhabited by one gains a special power as well as a flaw. The nine trickster gods don't get along, and they try to push one another out of the characters' bodies. As the gods fight over their living hosts, the characters must deal with the deadly traps and monsters that guard the Soulmonger. Venturing deeper into the tomb, they uncover clues about the dungeon's evil architect—the archlich **Acererak**—and learn that the Soulmonger is feeding souls to an undead horror called an atropal. Once it consumes enough souls, the atropal will transform into an evil god.

Destroying the Soulmonger ends the death curse affecting the world, while killing the atropal incurs the wrath of **Acererak**. Under normal circumstances, the enraged archlich would be far too great a foe for mortal adventurers to overcome, but with the trickster gods of Omu on their side, the heroes have a fighting chance.

## Running the Adventure
To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks (*Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monste**r Manual*).

>>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.

The *Monster Manual* and *Volo's Guide to Monsters*** contain stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. You don't need the latter reference to run *Tomb of Annihilation*, as all the necessary stat blocks from *Volo's Guide to Monsters* are included with the new monsters in *appendix D*.

When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block in the *Monster Manual*. If a stat block appears in *appendix D*, the adventure's text tells you so.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, unless the adventure's text directs you to an item's description in *appendix C*.

### Adventure Summary
The adventure is likely to play out as follows.

The adventurers are teleported to Port Nyanzaru, the only major settlement in Chult. After exploring the city (chapter 1), they embark on an expedition into the wilds of Chult (chapter 2), eventually finding the ruined city of Omu (chapter 3). The characters don't know that Omu is their ultimate destination from the outset; they must find clues or evidence pointing in that direction.

In this adventure, three creatures know that the cause of the death curse lies in Omu: **Grandfather Zitembe** in Port Nyanzaru, **Valindra Shadowmantle** in the Heart of Ubtao, and Saja N'baza in Orolunga. Several creatures know Omu's location: the guides **Eku** and **Salida** in Port Nyanzaru, **Valindra Shadowmantle** in the Heart of Ubtao, the aarakocra of Kir Sabal, Zalkoré of Nangalore, Saja N'baza in Orolunga, and the red dragon Tzindelor in Wyrmheart Mine. If the characters are unable to locate Omu or ascertain the source of the death curse, the following additional creatures might possess the knowledge they seek, at your discretion: Krr'ook in Dungrunglung, Nephyr in Firefinger, **Nanny Pu'pu** in Mbala, Bwayes O'tamu in the wreck of the *Narwhal*, the survivors of the *Star Goddess* shipwreck, and Red Wizards under **Valindra Shadowmantle**'s command.

As the adventurers explore Omu, they are either captured by yuan-ti or forced to confront them in their underground temple (chapter 4). Not far from the yuan-ti temple is the entrance to the Tomb of the Nine Gods (chapter 5). The Soulmonger lies deep within the tomb, which is riddled with puzzles, traps, monsters, and magical wards. Best case scenario: the adventure concludes with the destruction of the Soulmonger and the heroes' daring escape from the tomb. Worst case scenario: the characters succumb to the evil of **Acererak**, and their souls are devoured.

> ##### Who Is Acererak?
>**Acererak** is a powerful lich known and feared throughout the multiverse. Much of his past is forgotten, but ancient texts assert that he comes from a world called Oerth.
>
>**Acererak** travels the planes in search of artifacts. When he finds something useful or interesting, he locks it away. Although he's powerful enough to pursue godhood as other liches have done (Vecna being a prime example), **Acererak** has no interest in being a god or being worshiped. He prefers to create evil gods and unleash them on mortals and immortals who oppose him.
>
>Despite passing up opportunities for godhood, **Acererak** attracts his fair share of followers and worshipers. He doesn't grant spells, nor does he give his devotees much of his precious time. Mostly he likes to watch them suffer and die as a result of their magical pursuits and folly.
>
>Although he has lived on many worlds and crafted countless demiplanes, **Acererak** spends most of his time building tombs. He fills each one with treasure to attract powerful adventurers. He then kills them off in terrible fashion, using deadly traps and monsters while baiting and ridiculing them. The terror he evokes scars their souls, which he traps in his phylactery, the location of which is one of the multiverse's greatest secrets.
>
>Not too long ago by human standards, **Acererak** found an atropal adrift at the edge of the Negative Plane and built the Soulmonger to nourish it to godhood. The lich chose one of his tombs—specifically the Tomb of the Nine Gods on Toril—to serve as the atropal's nursery.

### Death Curse
Understanding how **Acererak**'s death curse works is vital to running the adventure smoothly.

The Soulmonger was activated 20 days ago and remains active until it is destroyed. While the Soulmonger is active, the following effects are in play:

- Any humanoid on the planet that has been brought back from the dead begins to waste away. Its hit point maximum is reduced by 20 (1 for each day the Soulmonger has been active) and decreases by 1 every midnight until the Soulmonger is destroyed. If a humanoid's hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. Traveling to another world or plane does nothing to halt the wasting effect once it has begun.
- A humanoid whose hit point maximum is reduced can't increase or restore it. This is true whether the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by the Soulmonger or by some other life-draining effect, such as the touch of a wight, wraith, or similar creature.
- If a humanoid dies anywhere on the planet, its soul becomes trapped inside the Soulmonger. Only the destruction of the Soulmonger can free the trapped soul.
- Any spell that breathes life into the dead (including *revivify*, *raise dead*, *resurrection*, and *true resurrection*) automatically fails if cast on a humanoid whose soul is either trapped in the Soulmonger or has been devoured by the atropal (see "Soul Devouring" below).
- The Soulmonger does not affect the workings of *speak with dead* spells or similar magic. The death curse has no effect on preexisting ghosts or spirits.

#### Meat Grinder
*Tomb of Annihilation* can be played as written, or you can make it even more difficult by running it as a meat grinder. This mode of play is suitable for experienced players who have highly optimized characters and who don't mind putting those characters in jeopardy for the sake of a good challenge. It is less ideal for players who are inexperienced or get anxious at the thought of losing their characters.

You must choose to run the adventure as a meat grinder from the very beginning. In this mode of play, the Soulmonger gains the power to draw characters who are close to death, and the following rule applies:

- A death saving throw succeeds on a roll of 15 or higher (instead of 10 or higher). This effect ends when the Soulmonger is destroyed. Other rules concerning death saving throws remain unchanged.

#### Soul Devouring
The soul of any humanoid that dies while the death curse is active becomes trapped inside the Soulmonger. The soul remains there until it is consumed by the atropal or the Soulmonger is destroyed.

Once a soul becomes trapped in the Soulmonger, it's only a matter of time before the atropal devours it. You can determine the status of a trapped soul at dawn on any given day by secretly rolling a d20. On a roll of 2 or higher, the soul remains trapped in the Soulmonger, at least until the next dawn. A roll of 1 indicates that the soul was devoured by the atropal. A creature whose soul is devoured in this horrific manner can't be returned to life by any means, including divine intervention.

If the Soulmonger is destroyed and you haven't been tracking the status of a particular soul trapped within, grab a handful of d20s—one die for each day the soul was trapped—and roll them together. If you roll a 1 on any of the dice, the soul was devoured before it could be set free.

Spells such as *commune* and *divination* can be used to determine whether a soul has been devoured or whether it's still trapped in the Soulmonger.

How many souls must the atropal devour to become a god? It could be thousands or millions. Ultimately it's the DM's call, but the default assumption is that this apotheosis could take months or years.

#### Replacement Characters
The death curse means that, for the most part, dead characters stay dead. If a character dies and there's no reasonable way for the player to continue playing that character, you can have the player create a new character. A replacement character should be the same level as the rest of the party.

Chult attracts adventurers from all over the world, and the activation of the Soulmonger draws even more adventurers than usual to its untamed wilderness. The player characters are among the earliest to arrive, but adventurers from across the globe begin to converge in Chult as the crisis mounts. It should not be difficult to introduce new characters to replace those who have perished. A new character might be the last surviving member of a doomed expedition, a guide who has lived in Chult for years, a lone explorer seeking glory or treasure, or someone racing against time to save a loved one affected by the death curse. Work with the player to come up with a story that makes sense, given the circumstances.

#### Ticking Clock
*Tomb of Annihilation* is a time-bomb adventure. In other words, time is of the essence. The characters are under pressure to find and destroy the Soulmonger quickly, since many lives depend on it.

Time pressure aside, Chult is a land ripe with adventure possibilities, and characters might be drawn by curiosity or circumstance to locations such as the garden ruin of Nangalore, the dwarven forge of Hrakhamar, or the pirate haven of Jahaka Anchorage. Such locations present dangers that, when overcome, prepare the characters for greater threats awaiting them in Omu. If the characters reach Omu too soon, they probably won't be high enough level to survive there for long. When the characters make inquiries about Omu, paint the lost city as a terrifying place so that players feel the tension of wanting to get there quickly, but not too quickly.

### Character Advancement
Characters begin the adventure at 1st level and gain XP by defeating monsters. After each game session, add up all the XP earned and distribute it evenly among the party members. If the characters gain enough XP to advance a level, encourage your players to level up their characters before the next session. Ideally, the characters should fall within the desired level range for each chapter of the adventure, as shown in the Suggested Character Levels table.

#### Suggested Character Levels

| Chapter | Suggested Level |
|---|:---:|
| 1. Port Nyanzaru | 1st and higher |
| 2. Land of Chult | 1st–6th |
| 3. Dwellers of the Forbidden City | 5th–8th |
| 4. Fane of the Night Serpent | 7th–9th |
| 5. Tomb of the Nine Gods | 9th and higher |

You can slow the rate of advancement by withholding XP, "banking" it until you're ready for the party to level up. Conversely, you can hasten level advancement by awarding ad hoc XP for making discoveries, completing goals, roleplaying well, and surviving or avoiding deadly traps. Any such ad hoc award should be no more than what the characters would earn for defeating a monster with a challenge rating equal to their level. For example, a fair ad hoc award for a party of 2nd-level adventurers would be 450 XP, which is what the characters would earn for defeating a challenge rating 2 monster. As with other XP awards, the amount should be divided evenly among all party members.

As the DM, you can dispense with XP tracking and allow characters to gain levels at whatever pace suits your campaign, using the Suggested Character Levels table as your guide.

Chult is loaded with fun distractions, alluring locations, and opportunities for characters to explore. Consequently, it can be hard to gauge what level the characters will be when they arrive at adventure locations. Again, let the Suggested Character Levels table guide you. For example, if the characters are 4th level and about to stumble into Omu (chapter 3), you might want to steer them in a different direction, throw random encounters at them until they've reached 5th level, advance them to 5th level automatically, or adjust encounters in Omu to make the threats easier toovercome.

### Starting at Higher Levels
Although the adventure assumes that the characters begin at 1st level, you can start them off at 5th level or 9th level instead.

#### Starting at 5th Level
Characters of 5th level will still find parts of chapters 1 and 2 challenging. If an encounter becomes too much of a cakewalk, you can introduce enemy reinforcements. Hold off on XP awards and level advancement until the characters reach Omu in chapter 3.

#### Starting at 9th Level
Characters of 9th level will steamroll through chapters 1 and 2, and that's fine. Spend less time on encounters in the jungle, and steer the characters toward Omu as quickly as possible. Once they arrive, run the adventure as you normally would. Characters at this level will still be challenged by chapters 3 and 4, particularly if you play the yuan-ti as intelligent adversaries. Hold off on XP awards and level advancement until the characters enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods in chapter 5.

## Starting the Adventure
The adventure's default starting location is the city of Baldur's Gate on the Sword Coast, in the Forgotten Realms setting. However, any large settlement will do. Possibilities from other D&D worlds include the Free City of Greyhawk on Oerth, the city of Specularum on Mystara, and the city of Sharn on Eberron.

To get things rolling, read or paraphrase the following introductory text to the players:

>>For the past several days, the talk of the streets and taverns has all been about the so-called death curse: a wasting disease afflicting everyone who's ever been raised from the dead. Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied. When they finally succumb, they can't be raised—and neither can anyone else, regardless of whether they've ever received that miracle in the past. Temples and scholars of divine magic are at a loss to explain a curse that has affected the entire region, and possibly the entire world.
>>

At this point, invite the players to explain why their characters are together, how long they've been together, and what they've been doing. If the characters don't know each other, you can have them meet at **Syndra Silvane**'s residence.

### Syndra Silvane's Curse
The party's benefactor is a retired adventurer named **Syndra Silvane**. Being a wizard and merchant of no small repute, she has magic to expedite the party's journey to Chult as well as treasure with which to reward characters for their assistance.

When you're ready for the characters to meet with Syndra, read:

>>You have been invited to the home of **Syndra Silvane**, a retired adventurer and merchant. A uniformed attendant leads you up a grand staircase to the third floor, then ushers you into a wood-paneled room with a fireplace, comfortable chairs, and a heavy table bearing goblets and bottles of wine. The darkly paneled walls are hung with maps and sea charts. Racks, shelves, and cabinets hold hundreds more rolled-up maps and charts.
>>
>>A person is seated in an overstuffed chair near the fire. You can't discern a gender, because only the person's head emerges from under a heavy blanket draped over the chair, and an embroidered hood and silver mask conceal the wearer's face. Even the person's dry, raspy voice provides no clue. "Help yourselves to wine, and seat yourselves, friends—I hope I may call you that."
>>

The masked speaker is **Syndra Silvane**. She is a Tethyrian human **archmage**, with these changes:

- Syndra is lawful neutral and speaks Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Halfling.
- Syndra's hit point maximum has been reduced to 79 by the Soulmonger's death curse, and it decreases by 1 every midnight. If her hit point maximum drops to 0, Syndra dies and can't be brought back from the dead until the death curse has ended (and if her soul hasn't been devoured). Destroying the Soulmonger is the only way to halt the attrition and restore her hit point maximum to normal.

#### Roleplaying Syndra Silvane
Syndra tells the characters her story and makes her request. Roleplay the encounter, paraphrasing the following information and responding in Silvane's dry, cracking voice to the characters' questions:

- "I was an adventurer years ago. I died once and was raised from the dead. I have since closed the door on that stage of my life."
- "The death curse you've heard about has struck me. I don't know how much longer I'll last before I perish. Clerics have no help to offer. They're stymied by what is happening."
- "My contacts in the Harpers have learned that the cause of the death curse is a necromantic artifact called the Soulmonger. According to their sources, the Soulmonger is somewhere in Chult."
- "Chult is a peninsula ringed with mountains and choked with rainforests. Enormous reptiles, savage goblins, and an army of undead prowl its jungles and ruins. Mapping the place has always been nigh impossible, and nothing is known about the region's current geography beyond a few miles from the coast."
- "Working from dozens of sea charts, log books, and explorers' journals, I assembled everything known about the current state of Chult into one map. I'll provide it to you if you undertake my mission."
- "When you're ready to depart, I will teleport us all to Port Nyanzaru, the only major settlement in Chult. I've been there several times before, so there's little chance of mishap. Once there, I'll stay with a friend named **Wakanga O'tamu**. He's one of seven merchant princes who rule the city."

Syndra has misgivings about sending inexperienced adventurers on so dangerous a quest, but she isn't taking any chances. She fails to mention that other, more experienced parties of adventurers have been sent to Chult already. All have disappeared, and Syndra fears the worst. In truth, they fell victim to the perils of Chult or crossed paths with **Valindra Shadowmantle**, and were never seen or heard from again. If the characters urge Syndra to seek out a more experienced party of adventurers, she replies dryly, "I already have."

#### Treasure
Syndra promises each character a rare or uncommon magic item, delivered upon successful completion of her quest. (At the end of the adventure, each player can choose an appropriate item, subject to your approval.) Syndra also expects that the characters will find enough treasure in Chult to make them as rich as kings.

If the characters press for coin up front, Syndra gives each character 50 gp to defray expenses in Port Nyanzaru.

#### Players' Map of Chult
At this point, give the players a copy of **Syndra Silvane**'s incomplete map of Chult (see handout 1 in *appendix E*). Syndra gladly answers their questions to the best of her ability, but she doesn't know much more about Chult than what's on the map. She knows Port Nyanzaru well enough to assure characters that they can buy supplies there.

#### Teleporting to Chult
In the interest of time, Syndra is prepared to use a *teleport* spell to transport herself and the heroes to Port Nyanzaru. If the characters agree, don't bother rolling to determine the spell's accuracy. Syndra knows the city's Harbor Ward well enough to arrive on target. She chooses an outdoor location near the docks as her destination. When the characters arrive in Port Nyanzaru, skip to the "Arrival" section in chapter 1.

## Welcome to Chult
With the exception of a few coastal settlements, Chult is untamed tropical wilderness: dense jungles and snaky rivers ringed by mountains, volcanoes, and sheer escarpments. Walls of mountains to the west, south, and east shield the interior from the sea and from the view of sailors. The rivers are so sluggish that it can be difficult determining which direction is upstream and which is down. The rivers pick up speed only where they thunder down through steep-sided gorges.

The safest entry points into this overgrown realm ("safest" is a relative term in this context) are on the north and east. The coast from the Bay of Chult to Refuge Bay offers beaches on which to embark into the uncharted jungle. Along the entire coast, the Bay of Chult is the only spot where travelers can find welcoming civilization. The rest of the peninsula is a breeding ground for bloodsucking, disease-bearing insects, monstrous reptiles, carnivorous birds and beasts of every variety, and murderous undead. The farther one moves from the coast, the more humid, hot, and inhospitable the land becomes.

### Weather
Chult is hot, humid, and rainy throughout the year. The temperature regularly climbs as high as 95 degrees F (35 degrees C) during the day and seldom falls below 70 degrees F (20 degrees C) even at night. A day without rain is rare, but rain varies from a steady mist to drenching downpours.

Visibility in heavy rain is limited to 50 yards. Beyond that distance, only Huge or larger objects can be distinguished. Missile weapon ranges are halved during rain.

On days that receive heavy rain, there's a 25 percent chance of a full-blown tropical storm featuring sheets of rain, high wind, lightning, tall waves at sea, and immense surf along the coast. Guides who know the conditions in Chult recommend hunkering down and staying put on these days. Travel by river is impossible (canoes are swamped by waves within 15 minutes of launching). If characters insist on traveling by foot, every character gains 1 level of exhaustion automatically and must make a successful DC 10 Constitution check or gain another. Skill checks to avoid becoming lost are made with disadvantage on storm days.

### Races of Chult
Members of every race and nationality of Faerûn can be found in Port Nyanzaru, but few of them ever travel more than a hundred yards beyond the city walls. The native peoples must be divided into those that are commonly known and those whose presence is legendary or only suspected. The first group consists of Chultans (humans), aarakocra, Batiri (goblins), dwarves (including albino dwarves), pterafolk, and tabaxi. In the second category, weretigers are suspected to be present in small numbers; explorers and hunters sometimes report seeing grungs (frog folk) deep in the jungle; and yuan-ti are rumored to be making a resurgence in remote areas.

In addition to these known and suspected residents, a crew of frost giants has come to Chult seeking the *Ring of Winter* and an expedition of Red Wizards is hunting for the Soulmonger, but the presence of these bands is still unknown to the larger population.

Finally, the deep jungle is overrun by skeletons, zombies, ghouls, and other types of undead. Everyone in Chult is all too aware of their presence.

#### Chultans
Chultans are the human natives of Chult. They have dark skin, black hair, and a rich culture. Driven out of the jungle by monsters and undead, they took refuge behind the stout walls of Port Nyanzaru, gave up their dynasties, and united to become a mercantile power in the southern ocean, eager to do business with anyone who visits their perilous land. A few Chultans migrated northward and established outposts in distant cities such as Athkatla, Baldur's Gate, Calimport, Memnon, and Zazesspur.

The lines of kings and queens that once held political sway throughout Chult have been mostly wiped out by time, war, calamity, and misfortune. They've been replaced by Chultan merchant princes who learned the art and craft of trading from Amnian and Tethyrian profiteers, and who now use their wealth to forge profitable alliances and to steer the fate of their frontier realm.

Chultans dress in light, colorful clothing appropriate for the tropical climate. They trade in gold, gemstones, jewelry, textiles, spices, rare herbs, ivory, wood, unrefined metal ore, and other commodities plucked and plundered from the jungles, valleys, and mountains of Chult. Among themselves, all Chultans still speak their own languages (a mix of exhaled and inhaled vowels, consonants, and tongue clicks), but any who deal regularly with foreigners also speak Common fluently, often with a heavy, characteristic accent.

Chultans in Port Nyanzaru seldom don armor because of the climate, but large, colorful shields made from toughened dinosaur hide are ubiquitous. These shields are called hlang and function as ordinary shields. In melee, they favor the traditional *yklwa* (pronounced YICK-ul-wah), a short, broad-bladed, one-handed, spear-like weapon. For more information about the yklwa, see "Buying a Special Item."

#### Aarakocra
Tribes of aarakocra live atop the mountains and plateaus of Chult. Aarakocra leaders are skilled dancers who use their dances to inspire their followers as well as cast spells.

Aarakocra strive to defend the land against the forces of evil. They have a reputation for aiding explorers who are lost, sick, or in some other trouble, provided those explorers aren't intent on plundering Chult's natural resources or exploiting its inhabitants. The aarakocra are natural enemies of pterafolk and the gargoyles of Omu.

One aarakocra tribe has laid claim to a remote Chultan monastery called Kir Sabal. This site's existence is well known in Port Nyanzaru because the structures can be seen from the River Olung through occasional breaks in the jungle along the eastern bank. Little is known beyond that, however, because the cliffside structures are so difficult to reach from the ground. The aarakocra there shelter the last descendants of Omu's royal family, who hope to someday restore their reign.

![[002-0103.webp|right|300]]

#### Batiri (Goblins)
Chult is home to scores of independent goblin tribes collectively known as the Batiri. A Batiri tribe is ruled by a queen (use the **goblin boss** statistics). When a queen dies, fighting ensues until a new queen emerges victorious and proclaims herself ruler of the tribe. While the Batiri have many cultural and mythical aspects that make them unique, they behave essentially like other goblins; they are superstitious, cruel, suspicious of outsiders, fractious among themselves, and just as likely to torture and eat other humanoids as they are to trade with them. They are not only sadistic but highly creative in their tortures. For example, they enjoy tying enemies to trees, dousing them in honey, and leaving them to be devoured by insects over the course of several days, if a larger predator doesn't finish them off first.

***War Masks.*** Batiri warriors wear oversized wooden war masks into combat. Each goblin paints and decorates its own mask to make it look as fearsome as possible. Aside from intimidating enemies, these masks serve the same purpose among the Batiri as coats of arms among noble knights of Faerûn. Batiri of opposing tribes might not know an enemy's given name, but they'll know Snarling Crocodile or Fanged Ape.

![[003-0104.webp|right|300]]

***Battle Stacks.*** Batiri warriors sometimes ride on each other's shoulders in battle, in a formation known as a battle stack. These can be up to nine goblins tall. Each goblin tracks its hit points individually, but the stack moves and makes ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws as one creature. Only the goblin at the top of the stack can attack, and only the goblin at the bottom can move (all goblins stacked on its shoulders move with it). The goblin at the top makes all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability checks and saving throws for the stack. The goblin at the bottom makes all Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution ability checks and saving throws for the stack. A battle stack can't jump, but it can grapple or shove another creature, swing from vines, and use the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, and Hide actions. The stack has advantage on melee attacks because of its built-in "pack tactics" effect; all the goblins are waving spears at the enemy, even if only one can hit.

When a goblin in the stack drops to 0 hit points, it is thrown from the stack. If the stack succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, it remains intact (albeit one goblin shorter). On a failed save, the stack collapses and all the goblins fall prone in a 5-foot-square space.

To form a new battle stack, a goblin must use its action to climb onto the shoulders of another willing goblin within 5 feet of it. Other goblins can join an existing battle stack in the same way. A goblin can use its action to remove itself from a battle stack, landing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bottom of the stack.

The Batiri invented battle stacks as a way to combat creatures much larger than themselves as well as a way to reach enemies in trees. The battle stack formation has the added effect of making the puny goblins appear taller and more fearsome to their larger enemies. Battle stacks are not effective against other ground-based threats, since all but the topmost goblin give up their attacks and mobility to be part of the stack.

#### Dwarves
Most of the shield dwarf strongholds beneath Chult were destroyed by intense volcanic activity. Hundreds of dwarves were forced to flee their collapsing halls, only to be slaughtered and devoured by jungle predators. A few made it to Port Nyanzaru, where they remain to this day. Some of these survivors are albinos (see *appendix D* for more information).

#### Frost Giants
Twenty frost giants came to Chult in search of the *Ring of Winter*. Their ship is anchored north of Kitcher's Inlet, and teams of frost giants are scouring the jungle for signs of the ring and its wearer, **Artus Cimber**. A female frost giant named **Drufi** leads the hunt. So far the frost giants have gone about their business unnoticed, but it's only a matter of time before they encounter a Flaming Fist patrol from Fort Beluarian. The frost giants hate Chult and its climate, but they won't give up the search for the ring no matter what the cost.

#### Grungs
These predominantly evil frog folk live in villages scattered throughout the jungle. They build their primitive structures from mud, vines, and wicker, and are more comfortable in trees than on the ground. They pepper enemies with poisoned arrows and leap from branch to branch without leaving any trail.

Not all grungs are evil. A few are willing to help explorers in exchange for food or treasure. Evil or not, grungs warn away intruders by hanging the bodies of slain foes from trees at the edge of their territory.

Some Chultan guides are aware of one grung village due south of Port Nyanzaru, just above the headwater of the River Tiryki (pronounced tee-REE-kee). For more information on this village, see "Dungrunglung." *Appendix D* contains additional information on grungs.

#### Pterafolk ("Terror Folk")
These malevolent flying reptilian humanoids swoop down on unsuspecting prey, steal what they can, and retreat to their high lairs to gloat over their stolen loot. The suddenness and violence of their raids has earned them the nickname "terror folk" among other races of Chult. They are natural enemies of the aarakocra. See the pterafolk entry in *appendix D* for full details.

#### Tabaxi
Tabaxi are feline humanoids, originally native to the western continent of Maztica. Some Chultans refer to them as "cat folk" or "leopard people." Groups of tabaxi wound up in Chult after escaping from slavers. They are a cultured people and seldom evil. A few work as guides out of Port Nyanzaru. Others enter the jungle in small groups to hunt grungs and goblins for their own purposes.

Tabaxi hunters can be encountered anywhere in Chult. Tabaxi minstrels are seldom met outside Port Nyanzaru. *Appendix D* includes statistics for both. Tabaxi can also be player characters (see *Volo's Guide to Monsters* for tabaxi racial traits).

#### Undead
Over a century ago, the warlord **Ras Nsi** raised an undead army to conquer the city of Mezro. The army consisted mainly of dead Chultans raised as zombies and cannibals transformed into ghouls. **Ras Nsi** and his legion were defeated and driven back into the jungle. Before **Ras Nsi** could organize another attack, Mezro planeshifted away, and **Ras Nsi** was stripped of his god-given powers. Declaring himself an enemy of the world, he threw his lot in with the yuan-ti. The remnants of **Ras Nsi**'s undead army spread through the jungle like a blight, until now they claim hundreds of miles of wilderness as their hunting ground. To make matters worse, **Acererak** filled out their ranks with horrible undead creatures such as girallon zombies and tyrannosaurus zombies (see *appendix D*), mainly to discourage explorers from getting too close to Omu. As the atropal feeds on the souls of the dead, it grows in power. Eventually, it will become powerful enough to control these ravenous undead creatures. Until then, the undead hordes of Chult have no leader.

#### Weretigers
Chultans infected with weretiger lycanthropy haunt the jungle in small families or prides. Everyone in Port Nyanzaru has heard this rumor, but not all believe it.

Weretiger prides avoid outsiders, including adventurers, but a few evil weretigers enjoy making a sport of hunting intruders who come to plunder their land. Since weretigers can appear human, they readily pose as Chultan hunters, guides, rescuers, or explorers to lure in prey. These evil weretigers usually worship Malar, the god of the hunt. Others continue worshiping whatever deities they revered before becoming lycanthropes.

#### Yuan-ti
After being driven out of their ancient city (see "Hisari,"), the yuan-ti claimed the ruins of Omu as their demesne. Their spies in Port Nyanzaru keep a wary eye on the merchant princes, would-be treasure hunters, and adventurers. Characters might also encounter yuan-ti purebloods, yuan-ti malisons, and yuan-ti abominations searching the jungle for hidden settlements and lost treasures.

The yuan-ti of Omu believe that a sealed portal lies somewhere under the Peaks of Flame and that opening it will enable Dendar the Night Serpent to enter the world. The god Ubtao was supposed to stand against Dendar, but with Ubtao gone from the world, the yuan-ti believe nothing can stop the Night Serpent. They have dedicated an underground temple to this serpentine destroyer of worlds, but they are a long way from fulfilling their ultimate goal.

Additional information about yuan-ti can be found in *Volo's Guide to Monsters*, as well as *appendix D*.

> ##### Gods of Chult
>A central figure in Chult's history is the greater god Ubtao, who long protected the land and Chultan civilization. But Ubtao grew angry over his worshipers' endless warring and their reliance on him to solve all their problems. More than a century ago, Ubtao simply abandoned Chult, and his influence hasn't been felt there since that day. When he left, the Chultans suffered a crippling spiritual blow, but eventually the disunited, warring tribes learned to put aside their petty conflicts and unite as one people. To this day, the dinosaurs of Chult are still revered as Ubtao's sacred children by many Chultans, even though Ubtao himself is no longer popular.
>
>With Ubtao gone, the Chultans turned to other deities, including ones introduced to them by missionaries from distant civilizations. Waukeen, a goddess of trade, is revered by Port Nyanzaru's many merchants. Other deities with shrines in the city include Gond (god of craft), Savras (god of divination and fate), Sune (goddess of love and beauty), and Tymora (goddess of good fortune).
>
>Besides spreading word of their deities, however, too many foreign missionaries also exploited the Chultans and their land for profit, which led to many conflicts. The temples and shrines persist, but most of the clergy are now Chultans. Foreign clerics who proselytize too energetically aren't welcomed in Port Nyanzaru.

# Chapter 1: Port Nyanzaru
![[004-0201.webp|right|300]]

Port Nyanzaru hugs the coastline at the south end of the Bay of Chult. No other city exists in Chult, along the coast or anywhere else, except in ruins or overrun by monstrous creatures. Until recently, Port Nyanzaru was under the firm control of Amn, a foreign nation. Nine years ago, Amn was forced to relinquish the city to a wealthy and powerful consortium of Chultan traders backed by the Ytepka Society (pronounced yeh-TEP-kah), or risk a bloody conflict that probably would have ended with the city winning its independence anyway. Seven Chultan traders have since grown into influential merchant princes, enticing folk from up and down the Sword Coast with their wares.

Port Nyanzaru is a bastion of civilization and commerce in a terrifying land. The amount of business that unfolds here and the cash that moves through its counting houses would make any merchant of Baldur's Gate or Waterdeep jealous. It's also a colorful, musical, aroma-filled, vibrant city in its own right. Other than trade, the biggest attractions are the weekly dinosaur races through the streets. Locals and visitors alike wager princely sums on the races' outcomes. The city also boasts grand bazaars, glorious mansions and temples, circuses, and gladiatorial contests.

Enemies surround Port Nyanzaru on all sides. The jungle teems with ferocious reptiles and murderous undead, pirates prowl the surrounding sea, and the mouth of the bay is home to a greedy dragon turtle.

Characters who question locals can learn rumors that might help them survive the perils of Chult. The characters can secure gear and guides before leaving the city. **Syndra Silvane** is too weak to accompany them or provide any additional support.

If you are running this adventure in a homebrew D&D setting, you can place Port Nyanzaru wherever you see fit and even change its name. If you're using another published D&D setting, you can dispense with Port Nyanzaru entirely and use a different coastal city as the launching point for the party's jungle expedition. Examples from other settings include the city of Sasserine on the edge of the Oerth's Amedio Jungle, the city of Slagovich near the Savage Coast of Mystara, and the city of Stormreach on Eberron's continent of Xen'drik.

## Arrival
**Syndra Silvane** teleports herself and the characters to Port Nyanzaru's Harbor Ward, not far from the harbormaster's office (area 13). Read:

>>You appear in a tropical city under the blazing sun. The familiar sounds of a harbor—creaking ropes, slapping waves, heavy barrels rolling across cobblestones—mingle with voices shouting and cursing in an unfamiliar language filled with clicks, inhalations, and singsongy words that make it sound almost musical. The aroma of unfamiliar spices and tropical fruit mixes with the wharfside smells of fish, tar, and canvas.
>>
>>Beyond all that, Port Nyanzaru is an explosion of color. Buildings are painted in bright shades of blue, green, orange, and salmon pink, or their walls are adorned with murals portraying giant reptiles and mythical heroes. Every building sports baskets and clay urns of colorful flowers or is draped in leafy, flowering vines. Minstrels in bright clothing adorned with feathers and shells perform on street corners. Multicolored pennants and sun awnings flutter atop the city walls. A crowd of children dressed in feathered hats and capes races past you, squealing in delighted terror as a street performer costumed as a big-toothed lizard stomps and roars behind them. The whole city seems to be bustling, sweating, laughing, swearing, and singing.
>>

Syndra recommends that the characters secure rooms for themselves at either the Thundering Lizard (if they're looking for a raucous time) or Kaya's House of Repose (if they want a good night's sleep). Both inns are located near the Red Bazaar (area 18). Meanwhile, Syndra heads to the villa of the merchant prince **Wakanga O'tamu**. There she intends to stay for the remainder of the adventure. If the characters express interest in accompanying her, she's more than happy to introduce them to Wakanga (see "Merchant Princes").

When describing the sights and sounds of Port Nyanzaru, emphasize the heat, the humidity, the exotic sounds and smells, and other unique aspects of Port Nyanzaru. Some of its notable features are described hereafter:

- Medium and Large dinosaurs are used as beasts of burden to haul two-wheeled carts, to hoist heavy loads on cranes, and to tow boats along the canals.
- Dinosaurs compete in weekly races through the streets. These brightly painted racing dinosaurs are fast, vicious, and barely under their riders' control.
- Flowers, green plants, and vines grow everywhere, seeming to spring out of the building stones themselves. The profusion of greenery needs constant tending to prevent roots and shoots from damaging buildings or tile roofs.
- The city's defensive walls and towers are topped with colorful awnings to shield guards from the sun and rain.
- All streets within the city walls are paved with cobblestones or flagstones, and they have deep rain gutters as much as 2 feet wide. Residents of Port Nyanzaru pay little attention to any but the heaviest deluge.
- Tabaxi minstrels wander the streets, performing for anyone who tosses them a few coins.
- Walls divide the city into districts, and the open archways above the streets are painted with murals of dinosaurs, mountains, and mythic heroes.
- Crumbling ancient buildings covered with vines and lichens indicate the city's great age.

The ground floors of most buildings are made of stucco-covered stone and have tiny windows to keep out the heat at street level. The upper floors have bamboo or thatch walls with enormous windows to let in the breeze, under broad thatched or tiled eaves. All buildings are richly decorated with paint, ivy, and vivid flowers. Some are painted in symmetrical, geometric patterns of straight lines and sharp angles, while others portray animals, monsters, landscapes, and heroes in a stylized manner unique to Chult. Where space permits, buildings traditionally include a walled yard or garden.

All the city's water comes from rain, so every building has a cistern or wooden barrels to catch water running off the roof. Every public square is built around a fountain or rain basin. With so much water running downhill, Chultans also make excellent use of water-driven mechanical gadgets. Many buildings have water wheels built into their cisterns. Rainwater running through spouts or channels turns the wheel, which pumps water into pools, turns millstones, powers bellows or lathes or saws, or accomplishes any other labor-saving or amusing task Chultan engineers can dream up.

## Side Quests
As the characters explore Port Nyanzaru, they might encounter NPCs who need their help. Given the urgency of their mission, characters might be reluctant to take on side quests. They are under no obligation to complete them; however, completing a side quest can lead to unexpected rewards and discoveries.

Introduce as many or as few of these side quests as you like. The NPCs who trigger them can be encountered anywhere within the city. If you can't decide which side quest to choose, roll a d10.

- 1. Collect a Debt. K'lahu (N female Chultan human **thug**), a bookie who takes bets at Executioner's Run (see area 2), asks the adventurers to come with her as she collects a debt. The pay is 10 percent of whatever is collected on the 500 gp debt, which is owed by a man named Taban (N male Chultan human **gladiator**). Taban refuses to pay anything until he's beaten down to 20 or fewer hit points, whereupon he offers up a pouch containing ten 50 gp gemstones. Ashamed by his defeat and eager to redeem himself, Taban offers to join the party as a follower, demanding no pay for the duration of the adventure.
- 2. Create a Distraction at Fort Beluarian. Rokah (N male Chultan human **spy**) works for the Zhentarim. The Zhents believe that pirates have formed an alliance with the Flaming Fist. Rokah has orders to infiltrate Fort Beluarian and find proof so that the Zhentarim can blackmail the fort's commander. He asks the adventurers to escort him safely to the fort and create a distraction so that he can ransack the commander's quarters. As a reward, Rokah offers to cover the cost of a charter of exploration (50 gp), which the characters will almost certainly need if they want to avoid future confrontations with the Flaming Fist. Rokah also offers to introduce the characters to two wilderness guides—a pair tabaxi siblings named **River Mist** and **Flask of Wine** (see "Finding a Guide")—and pay the guides' fees.
- 3. Escort a Priest to Camp Vengeance. Undril Silvertusk (LG female half-orc **priest** of Torm with darkvision out to a range of 60 feet) is a representative of the Order of the Gauntlet and newly arrived in Port Nyanzaru. She needs to deliver herself plus a packet of dispatches from her superiors to Commander **Niles Breakbone** at Camp Vengeance. Undril was led to believe she could simply buy a horse in the city and ride to the camp, but now that she sees the terrain and conditions, that's clearly not possible. She hopes to join any expedition headed up the River Soshenstar. Undril is quite attached to her chain shirt, but she's not unreasonable when presented with good arguments for shedding the armor. If characters gain Undril's respect, she'll intercede strongly on their behalf if any difficulties arise with Commander Breakbone (as they're likely to, as discussed in chapter 2).
- 4. Explore the Aldani Basin. Inete (LG female Chultan human **acolyte** of Savras) has had disturbing visions of red-robed wizards operating a secret base somewhere in the Aldani Basin. The head of her temple, **Grandfather Zitembe**, has too many other things on his mind, but he's given Inete permission to investigate. Inete would like to accompany the characters' expedition for safety, if characters are heading toward or through that region. She'll provide her own food and supplies, and "donate" another 100 gp to the expedition's expenses. She insists on stopping by the temple of Savras to gather her belongings and urges the characters to come along. If they do, the characters can meet **Grandfather Zitembe** (see area 7).
- 5. Find **Artus Cimber**. A half-elf named **Xandala** (see *appendix D*) approaches the characters and claims to be **Artus Cimber**'s daughter. Feigning worry, she asks the characters to help her find him. Artus can't be found using magic, but **Xandala** has heard that Artus left the city with a reptilian man who doesn't talk and smells funny. Both were last seen heading into the jungle. **Xandala** wants the *Ring of Winter* in Artus's possession, but she doesn't share this with the characters. Summerwise, **Xandala**'s pet **pseudodragon**, thinks the quest for the ring is too dangerous but has given up trying to talk sense into its mistress. Good-aligned characters might be able to turn Summerwise against **Xandala**, or at least get information from it that they can use to thwart **Xandala**'s plan or to aid Artus.
- 6. Help a Dyeing Man. Omala (N male Chultan human **commoner**) is a master colorist at the dye works (area 23). He recently bought some dancing monkey fruit on the black market and used them to make and sell dye. Shortly thereafter, he received an iron token from the Ytepka Society—a grim warning. He wishes to atone for his crime and seeks an audience with Kwayothé, the merchant prince who controls the legal sale of fruit. Fearing for his life, Omala asks the adventurers to accompany him to Goldenthrone (see area 4), where he plans to beg for Kwayothé's forgiveness. He has no money to offer the characters as a reward. Kwayothé is willing to forgive Omala's lapse in judgment provided the characters agree to kill a man named **Shago** within the next 10 days—no questions asked—and speak of the deed to no one. Kwayothé tells them that **Shago** works as a guide out of Fort Beluarian. If the characters fail in this task, Kwayothé has Omala sentenced to Executioner's Run (see area 2) for his crime.
- 7. Help the Lords' Alliance. Lerek Dashlynd (LN male Illuskan human **spy**), an agent of the Lords' Alliance, offers to trade a sailing ship for an accurate map of Chult that shows the exact location of the ruins of Nangalore and Orolunga. Lerek represents wealthy Waterdhavian interests, and the offer is genuine. If the characters present such a map, Lerek has a cleric cast *augury* before agreeing to buy it, to make sure he's not buying a fake. Once he's convinced that the map is genuine, Lerek arranges to have the promised ship arrive in 10 days.
- 8. Hunt Pirates. The harbormaster, **Zindar** (see area 13 and *appendix D*), is a secret member of the Ytepka Society. He knows that three pirate captains are attacking merchant ships heading to and from the Bay of Chult. The pirate ships are called the *Dragonfang*, the *Emerald Eye*, and the *Stirge*. **Zindar** has permission from the merchant princes to offer a bounty of 2,000 gp for each pirate ship that is captured and brought into port, and a bonus 500 gp for the capture of each pirate captain.
- 9. Save an Innocent Man. Belym (LG male Chultan human **commoner**) is distraught because his husband, Draza (LG male Chultan **commoner**), has been sentenced to Executioner's Run for stealing. Belym asserts that his husband was a victim of mistaken identity and sentenced without a proper hearing or trial. He's been unable to persuade anyone in authority that Draza is innocent. He'll give the characters 25 sp (all his savings) if they can help Draza from the sidelines so he survives the run. Draza is about to be thrown into the pit with a pair of **velociraptors**, so the characters must act quickly. Both the authorities and the gamblers take a dim view of interference.

10. Seek Wisdom at Orolunga. Eshek (NG male Chultan human **acolyte** of Savras) stumbles up to the characters in the street and whispers, "Speak to the wise guardian of Orolunga, east of Mbala. She can direct you to that which you seek." Then he collapses, unconscious. When he awakens moments later, Eshek has no memory of the last 12 hours aside from a driving need to find people matching the characters' descriptions. He's as puzzled by what just happened as the characters probably are, but he'll help them however he can. At the very least, he knows where Mbala is from speaking to porters who've been to Camp Vengeance.

## Locations in the City
Shown in map 1.1, Port Nyanzaru is a city of walls within walls. Burgeoning wealth has driven the city's richest residents to raise defenses against the jungle's dangers, and possibly against the dangers they perceive from the city's less-well-off districts, which all lie outside the main wall. The walls are impressive barriers of massive, fitted stone. Like other structures in Port Nyanzaru, they're decorated with colorful paintings of geometric designs, animals, and mythic figures.

The city is defined by four steep hills. The westernmost hill, called Temple Hill because it's home to the temple of Savras, is completely walled off from lower ground. A wide stone bridge crosses on arched columns from Temple Hill to Throne Hill, site of Goldenthrone. A second bridge connects Throne Hill to the southern slopes, site of several merchant princes' villas. East of the harbor, the Hall of Gold gleams atop the city's tallest hill, Mount Sibasa, which is connected by bridge to the neighboring Yklwazi Hill (pronounced yick-ul-WAH-zee), site of the Grand Coliseum. Steep, stepped streets and terraces surround each hill.

Outside the main walls are three slums: the Old City to the southwest, where many buildings are remnants of older, pyramidal construction; Malar's Throat to the south, where buildings cling to the walls of a lush canyon spanned by rope bridges; and Tiryki Anchorage to the southeast, where explorers and river folk gather.

About half the city's population lives crowded together outside the walls, where they're always exposed to sudden attacks by carnivores or undead. A volunteer citizens' brigade keeps watch for approaching danger. When residents of the outer wards hear the long blast of warning horns, day or night, they scramble for the safety of the Market Ward and Merchants' Ward until the all clear sounds.

> ##### Troubleshooting
>There's enough happening in Port Nyanzaru that you won't need to rely on random encounters to keep things interesting. That being said, if the players seem restless, use the random encounters in *appendix B* to spice things up a bit as they're gathering supplies for their expedition. At any time, the party might run into Volothamp Geddarm (see "City Denizens"). Volo's familiarity with Port Nyanzaru makes him a font of useful information. If the party doesn't already have a wilderness guide, he advises characters to secure one before they enter the jungle. Volo might also suggest that characters partake in the dinosaur races (see "Things to Do").
>
>If characters visit **Wakanga O'tamu**, he gives them the wizard's journal in his possession. If the party has not yet secured a guide by the time they meet Wakanga, he suggests that the characters arrange one through **Jobal**. Volo can facilitate an introduction. For more information on guides and their rates, see "Finding a Guide."

### Old City
Three ancient, vine-covered ziggurats tower above this crumbling ward. The whole district is a juxtaposition of ancient and decaying (but still occupied) stone structures interspersed with flimsy new huts and longhouses of bamboo and thatch.

The Old City is run by "beggar princes" in a mocking parallel to the merchant princes of the city proper. They have no official authority, but each of them sits atop a web of debts, favors, incriminating information, and loyal muscle that allows them to get things done with an efficiency that the merchant princes sometimes envy. Unlike the merchant princes, whose positions are based on wealth that passes from generation to generation in the same family, the identities and even the number of the beggar princes changes continually.

The Old City is run down but it isn't a slum or a haven for thieves. Most of the residents are lower-class laborers or struggling artisans who can't afford the higher rents of homes inside the city walls.

#### 1. Beggars' Palaces
The Beggars' Palaces are the two largest ziggurats of the Old City. Shops and tenements of bamboo are jammed onto the terraces of the ziggurats in wild profusion. The upper levels are cleaner and less crowded than those near street level. A narrow wooden bridge connects the upper levels above the press and noise of the street.

#### 2. Executioner's Run
The road through the Old City splits around a rectangular, stone-lined pit 15 feet deep, 50 feet wide, and 200 feet long. The original Amnian residents built it as an arena for a highly competitive ball game, and it still provides cheap entertainment for the locals. **Velociraptors** (see *appendix D*), **panthers**, or other hungry beasts (a juvenile **allosaurus** is a guaranteed crowd pleaser) are set loose in the pit, then convicted criminals are dropped in at one end. Any criminals who make it alive through the gauntlet of carnivores to the far end of the pit can scramble up knotted ropes and win their freedom, along with the adulation of the crowd. Spectators line the walls for these spectacles—including representatives from every level of Port Nyanzaru society, not just residents of the Old City. Bets are placed on which criminals will survive, which will die, how far runners will get before a beast brings them down, and how many kills each animal will rack up.

A handful of Chultans have become celebrities by surviving multiple dashes through Executioner's Run. It's been suggested that some people continue committing crimes solely because a conviction is the only way to get tossed into the pit, and betting is always heaviest on a repeat offender.

Occasionally an animal manages to leap or scramble out of the pit and runs amok through the terrified crowd. Moments of such high peril provide a perfect opportunity for bystanders to become heroes in the city and earn favors from the merchant princes.

#### 3. Refuse Pit
An enormous sinkhole serves as the city's garbage dump. Every type of refuse gets tossed here, up to and including dead bodies. It's a festering scar of garbage, rancid water, and vermin. Rats, insects, and ravens abound. **Ghouls** are sometimes seen prowling through the pit in search of fresh corpses.

Although the level of refuse in the pit rises and falls, the pit never gets full. This is thanks to an unknown number of **otyughs** living at the bottom and eating their fill daily. They're content to remain in the bountiful pit, but they'd quickly pounce on anyone careless or unlucky enough to slip on the greasy edge and fall in.

### Merchants' Ward
The western half of the city is called the Merchants' Ward because it's the site of the Grand Souk and because many of the merchant princes' villas are there. In general, this is the upper-class section of the city. The majority of the city's merchants and traders actually live and work in the Market Ward.

#### 4. Goldenthrone
This palace serves as the meeting place for the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru and is recognized as the seat of the city's loose government. It was built decades ago by an Amnian trader and is one of the most opulent structures in the city, rivaled only by the grander temples and the merchant princes' villas. An honor guard of eight Chultan **gladiators** is always on duty, to keep away loiterers in the daytime and thieves in the night.

Goldenthrone is the best place to meet any of the merchant princes without an appointment. They rarely meet with visitors who show up unannounced at their homes. During the day, each merchant prince has a 1-in-6 chance to be at Goldenthrone, accompanied by a retinue of aides and guards. Characters must wait 1d3 hours before being given an audience. In fact, the merchant princes have few day-to-day responsibilities when it comes to running Port Nyanzaru, so unless a meeting is being held to discuss city business, the delay is just a tactic to underscore who's in charge. If the characters have interesting news, they're likely to obtain an audience and to be given as much of the merchant's time as they need.

#### 5. Merchant Prince's Villa
Each merchant prince has a private villa in the city. These residences have beautifully plastered walls adorned with bright murals, patios and arcades festooned with fresh flowers, garden courtyards open to the sky, and enormous cisterns equipped with water wheels to power fountains, fans, and kinetic sculptures.

None of the merchant princes is likely to meet player characters who show up unannounced at their doors unless the characters did something noteworthy (such as winning a dinosaur race, stopping a rampaging carnivore, or completing an expedition that made significant discoveries). The exception is **Wakanga O'tamu**, who welcomes any adventurers traveling in the company of **Syndra Silvane**.

For details of a sample villa, see "Merchant Prince's Villa."

#### 6. Grand Souk
The Grand Souk, or market, is one of the three beating hearts of Port Nyanzaru—the others being the jewel market and the Red Bazaar. True to its name, the Grand Souk is the grandest of the three.

Traders from up and down the Sword Coast come to this market to buy timber, spices, medicines concocted from jungle plants, dinosaur skulls and claws, iron, tiger pelts, carved ivory, Batiri and grung handiwork, colored feathers, tropical fruit, monkeys, plesiosaur meat, and all the other riches of Chult. Business begins before the sun comes up, and dealing doesn't stop until well after darkness edges across the city. It's a noisy, jostling, aroma-rich circus. Guards are numerous, but less numerous than the urchins and pickpockets. Street performers and tabaxi minstrels add to the cacophony. Colorful awnings protect the market from sun and rain but also trap the heat and smells.

Everything listed in *chapter 5* of the *Player's Handbook* can be purchased in the Grand Souk. Unusual items might not be available (elephants aren't found in Chult, for example), but a merchant can always be contracted who'll bring an item to order, for the right price.

#### 7. Temple of Savras
Savras is a deity of wizards, fortune tellers, diviners, and those who unfailingly speak the truth regardless of whether listeners want to hear it. His symbol is a monstrous eye, or a crystal ball filled with eyes. Savras's temple is one of the oldest, grandest buildings in the city. The tiled roof of its great dome resembles an unblinking eye, staring skyward.

A deity devoted to revealing the truth might seem to have a weak draw in a city of merchants, but Savras was widely worshiped in Chult long before the Spellplague. In those years, Savras's clergy were valued because they could keep tabs on the activities of the inscrutable yuan-ti. The snake people still loom large as bogeymen in the imaginations of Chultans, but nowadays the clergy of Savras scries into more mundane matters: portents around business affairs, the outlook for newborn children, and affairs of the heart.

The head priest of the temple is **Grandfather Zitembe** (LG male Chultan human **priest**). When the characters meet the priest for the first time, he's in the midst of a heated conversation with three members of the Zhentarim (NE male Tethyrian human **assassins**) who are looking for **Artus Cimber**. The Zhents have come to the temple to see if Zitembe can cast a spell to aid in their search. Although the assassins offer payment in the form of a 500 gp ruby, Zitembe senses their evil intentions and shoos them away. The assassins seem hesitant to leave without satisfaction, but the arrival of the characters changes their minds, and they depart with scowls on their faces. The characters' timely arrival makes Zitembe predisposed to help them.

If he's approached for aid or advice in tracking down the Soulmonger, Zitembe's first reaction is to express disbelief that the death curse has anything to do with Chult. If characters give a compelling argument or make a donation to the church of at least 25 gp, Zitembe agrees to "consult the guides." This ritual takes 24 hours, during which Zitembe sees visions of "a jungle city far to the south, enclosed by cliffs and crawling with snakes" and "a black obelisk draped in vines." He dared not peer any deeper, but he urges the characters to seek out this city and the obelisk.

#### 8. Temple of Gond
The boxy stone temple of Gond looms behind the royal docks. It's popular among Port Nyanzaru's many artisans, craftspeople, smiths, ivory carvers, and hydro-engineers. Where most such temples have a forge as a centerpiece, this one features an immense fountain whose water jets shift continually to create amazing shapes. It's all done with nozzles and valves moving on cams, driven by the city's plentiful water pressure.

#### 9. Temple of Sune
Isolated atop a rocky formation in the sea, the temple of Sune is reachable only by an elevated causeway from Temple Hill or by boat. Steep steps wind up the cliff from the temple's small harbor. When seen from a distance, the temple's roof seems to float in midair—an illusion created by mirrors lining the outside walls. Inside, Sune's faithful and casual visitors alike can partake of public baths, receive lessons in applying makeup and styling one's hair, and learn to dress in a manner that suits the individual's body, profession, and the climate. Newcomers to the temple must make a Charisma check. Those who score 15 or higher are welcomed as brothers and sisters of Sune; those who score 10 or higher are offered friendly advice on how to improve their presentation; and those who score 9 or less are greeted with sad, sympathetic looks and surrounded by a crowd of coddling devotees.

#### 10. Jewel Market
The jewel market is intentionally styled as a miniature, more exclusive version of the Grand Souk. Its chief business is buying and selling the rich supply of jewels that are dug out of Chult's mines, but many other rare luxury items are also traded here. This market is largely secure against pickpockets and thieves, thanks to the privately hired security agents patrolling it openly (**guards**) and undercover (**spies**). All of them work for the merchant prince **Zhanthi**, who has a monopoly on the jewelry trade in Port Nyanzaru.

### Harbor Ward
Port Nyanzaru's harbor can accommodate ships of all sizes. The enclosed, eastern portion of the harbor is reserved for the use of the merchant princes, but the rest of the docks are available for use by any ship.

If the characters wish to travel by sea, they can book passage on the *Brazen Pegasus* at a cost of 10 gp per day (for the whole party). A 60-foot sloop built for speed, she has a single mast flying a square mainsail plus two triangular foresails, one aft sail, and a small topsail. All that canvas gives her a top speed of 10 mph under ideal conditions.

The *Brazen Pegasus* is captained by **Ortimay Swift and Dark** (CG female rock gnome **bandit captain** with darkvision out to a range of 60 feet), who is both clever and calm. The first mate is Grig Ruddell (N male Illuskan human **veteran**), a hulking man whose face is almost hidden by a heavy beard streaked with gray. Other than shouting orders at the crew and conversing in low tones with Captain Ortimay, Ruddell barely speaks. The remainder of the crew consists of six sailors (N male and female **bandits** of various ethnicities).

Characters might assume that Ortimay's chief business is smuggling—and they'd be correct. However, she is happy to take adventurers wherever they need to go. She knows about the dragon turtle in the Bay of Chult and expects the characters to provide the necessary tribute. She also knows that pirates prowl the waters around Chult, though her ship easily outruns theirs.

There are no permanent shelters or cabins on the main deck of the *Brazen Pegasus*. A tarp can be rigged across the aft portion of the deck for shade from the tropical sun. The sailors sleep on deck when weather permits. The lower deck houses Captain Ortimay's cabin and the cargo hold, which doubles as the crew's cooking, eating, and sleeping area in foul weather.

#### 11. Royal Docks
The term "royal" dates back to the age when Chult was ruled by true kings and queens instead of merchants. Now these docks are reserved for the exclusive use of the merchant princes and those diplomats, dignitaries, and influential foreign merchants whom the merchant princes want to flatter with privilege or impress with magnificence.

#### 12. Statue
The statue at the center of the harbor represents an ancient Chultan king in full regalia, resplendent in a loincloth of leopard skin and a headdress of feathers, shells, and tyrannosaurus teeth; draped in a cape of girallon fur and monkey tails; and wielding the traditional oval shield and yklwa of Chult. Residents call it **Na** N'buso, the Great King.

The statue isn't nearly as ancient as the mythic king it portrays. It was erected just five years ago, at a time when Port Nyanzaru was flexing its new mercantile muscle, to impress on foreigners that Chult is an independent land with a glorious history. Few who see it fail to get the message.

#### 13. Harbormaster's Office
Outside of the harbormaster's office is a bulletin board that provides the names and whereabouts of several wilderness guides (see "Finding a Guide"). The harbormaster is a half-gold dragon named **Zindar** (see *appendix D*). He's seldom in this sturdy, airy building, however; most of his time is spent dealing with the hundreds of disputes, traffic jams, and other minor problems that crop up every day on a busy quayside. **Zindar** finds that his imposing personal presence gets issues resolved more quickly and more to his satisfaction than any number of subordinates can accomplish. Clerks in the office seldom know exactly where **Zindar** is at any time, but messages can be left for him; he'll leave a reply within 1d6 hours.

If characters present themselves as adventurers, **Zindar** offers them a quest (see "Side Quests").

#### 14. Lighthouse
A flame burns atop the lighthouse day and night to guide ships through darkness, fog, and rain to the harbor. Various powders can be added to the fire to create thick columns of colored smoke that can be seen from Fort Beluarian and from the mines along the Bay of Chult.

#### 15. Fort Nyanzaru
The fort contains a winch for raising and lowering an immense iron chain stretched between the fort and the lighthouse. When the chain is raised, no ship can sail into or out of the harbor. The chain hasn't been raised against attackers in decades, but it's used occasionally to prevent a ship from slipping out of the harbor with criminals or contraband on board. The fort also mounts two ballistas that can launch heavy bolts or canisters of alchemist's fire. Its garrison consists of a **noble** (the castellan), four **veterans** (officers), and forty **guards** loyal to the merchant princes.

#### 16. Warehouse District
Goods of every type being shipped into or out of Port Nyanzaru are stored in these warehouses. Canals are cut between the rows of warehouses, allowing ships to be towed by harnessed dinosaurs directly to the desired warehouse for easier loading and unloading. A large ship can easily block a canal, so good traffic management is required; that's one of the harbormaster's responsibilities.

Like any warehouse district, this one is largely deserted at night, making it a good spot for secret meetings and other mischief.

#### 17. Dry Dock
Port Nyanzaru isn't famous for building ships, but many vessels that come here wind up needing hull repairs—especially those that had run-ins with typhoons, pirates, or Aremag the dragon turtle (see "Bay of Chult"). It's easy work for dinosaurs to drag ships out of the water into the drydock so holes can be patched and barnacles scraped off.

### Market Ward
The Market Ward is where most of Port Nyanzaru's regular shops are located and where most of its tradesfolk, merchants, and other middle-class residents live and work.

#### 18. Red Bazaar
No one knows how the Red Bazaar got its name. One story is that the label comes from the huge slabs of dinosaur meat sold here and the resulting buckets of blood that stain the rain-washed gutters, and that's probably as good an explanation as any.

The residents of Port Nyanzaru shop for their daily needs at the Red Bazaar. Unlike the Grand Souk, which deals heavily in durable goods and luxury items, the Red Bazaar deals in everyday needs: locally produced meat, vegetables, tropical fruit, tej, light tropical clothing, insect repellent, rain catchers, and other household goods. The buyers and sellers in the Red Bazaar are predominantly locals.

***Inns.*** Two noteworthy inns are located near the Red Bazaar. The Thundering Lizard caters to a raucous clientele, and a bed for the night costs 5 sp. Kaya's House of Repose is much quieter, but a bed for the night costs 1 gp. Wilderness guides are known to frequent both establishments, looking for work (see "Finding a Guide").

#### 19. Fish Market
Seafood is a staple in Port Nyanzaru, both because catching fish is easier and safer than hunting dinosaurs, and tender fish tastes better than tough reptile. The fish market is a great place to buy the day's meals. Prices are higher in the morning, when quality and selection are also better.

#### 20. Grand Coliseum
This stone arena is the site of gladiatorial games (usually nonlethal, but accidents happen), bloody animal combats, and spectacular circuses. The best gladiators become celebrities and earn fortunes. Statues of the arena's greatest champions line the tops of the Grand Coliseum's walls, including one of the city's current merchant princes. (**Ekene-Afa** gained fame and fortune as a gladiator before retiring from the arena to become a trader and politician.)

Events are held on most afternoons; only special shows are held after sundown, as the coliseum depends on natural light. During the week, the bill features qualifying matches, consolation bouts, and other small events. Major events, championships, and special extravaganzas are staged on holidays. A holiday show might include a battle between "heroes of legend" and "pirates" (all portrayed by gladiators), a bloody match pitting **velociraptors** against **tigers**, or even a contest of mages battling captured **ghouls**, **skeletons**, or **zombies**.

#### 21. Hall of Gold
This magnificent structure is a temple to Waukeen, but residents call it the Hall of Gold for its shining, golden roof and for Waukeen's focus on trade and wealth. Mount Sibasa is the highest point in the city, and when the sun is shining, light glinting off the temple roof can be seen for miles out at sea. Some city residents swear that the roof is sheathed in pure burnished gold, but it's only paint. A wide stone bridge connects Mount Sibasa to the Grand Coliseum on Yklwazi Hill.

The chief priest of Waukeen in Port Nyanzaru is Sibonseni, Mother of Prosperity (LN female Chultan **priest**). She is one of the city's most influential residents after the merchant princes, and she enjoys tremendous support from every layer of society for the temple's charitable work and for its support of civic improvements. In fact, the temple is also one of the city's richest banks. When Mother Sibonseni travels through the streets, she rides in an elegant sedan chair accompanied by drummers, singers, dancers, and temple aides who distribute fistfuls of copper coins to the poor. Needless to say, this causes traffic jams, but the people of the city love her.

#### 22. Public Bathhouse
Port Nyanzaru is a very clean city thanks to the cleansing rain, and its residents are also scrupulous about hygiene. Most would be repulsed by the thought of a day without a bath. Dozens of small bathhouses across the city operate like private clubs, but the public bathhouse is open to everyone and is run by the priesthood of Sune (see area 9). It's both egalitarian and elegant: wealthy merchants and dock laborers rub elbows in the tiled baths and marble-floored changing rooms. There is no charge, but bathers are requested to leave a donation to the temple of Sune befitting their station in life. Because Chultans are justifiably proud of this facility, even the poorest try to leave at least a copper piece in the giant clamshell by the entrance. Many independent masseurs and masseuses are on hand to massage weary muscles; these services cost 2d10 sp.

#### 23. Dye Works
Along with cleanliness, Chultans love colorful clothing. Textile weaving is not one of Chult's native industries, because the jungle isn't suited for growing cotton or raising sheep. However, the jungle and the sea provide everything necessary to concoct vibrant dyes in a rainbow of colors. Merchants import light, plain fabrics, which are dyed in vibrant colors and patterns at the dye works before being sold locally or exported back to the regions where the cloth originated. Local tailors craft the fabric into the long shirts, knee-length pants, sarongs, and kilts favored in Port Nyanzaru.

The cliff below the dye works and the sea around it are perpetually stained bright orange, blue, red, green, and yellow, depending on what colors are being dumped from the vats that day. People employed at the dye works are easily recognized on the street because their hands and feet are likewise brightly stained.

### Malar's Throat
This region outside the city walls is Port Nyanzaru's slum district. Two sheer, jungle-draped ridges flank a deep ravine. Ramshackle buildings cling to the sides of the ridges, each structure seemingly built atop the lower one's roof. During heavy rain, runoff pours down the ravine, through Ubtao's Jaws (the large gate in the city wall facing Malar's Throat), and down the paved streets to the harbor, often sweeping along unattended baskets, dead animals, and even clumsy or unlucky Chultans in its tow.

Foot bridges of rope and bamboo hang above the ravine. Some of them are 200 feet long or longer and sway a hundred feet above ground, terrifying the faint of heart. Skilled thieves have been known to drop hooks on thin lines from the bridges and "fish" purses right off victims' belts.

#### 24. Temple of Tymora
Tymora's temple is built like a sturdy blockhouse of heavy stone. It's not an elegant structure, but residents rely on it to be a safe refuge when floodwater pours down Malar's Throat or when the alarm horns blow and there's no time to reach the safety of the city before undead swarm up the ravine. The people who live in Malar's Throat don't consider themselves especially lucky, but what little luck they have, they attribute to the Lady's presence among them.

### Tiryki Anchorage
This district east of the city is populated by animal trainers, river folk, explorers who need inexpensive lodging, and other rough-and-tumble sorts. Smugglers prefer the unregulated docks of the anchorage over the policed and inspected docks of the harbor, despite the shortage of dock workers and beast-powered cranes to assist in loading and unloading.

Unlike Malar's Throat and the Old City, Tiryki Anchorage has no fortified temple or ancient stone ziggurats where residents can take shelter against undead or carnivores. Most people dash for Tiryki Gate when the alarm sounds and hope to get through before it's locked ahead of them. Fortunately, the animals in their pens are more sensitive to approaching enemies than humans are, so few creatures are able to sneak into the area undetected.

#### 25. Dinosaur Pens
Most of the beasts of burden in the city were trained out here, and they're penned up at night. Ankylosauruses and triceratopses are the most common in that role. Dinosaurs trained for street racing are also stabled here. Most Chultan handlers have a +5 bonus to Animal Handling skill checks, and they work with the same animals day after day.

## City Denizens
Chultans comprise two-thirds of Port Nyanzaru's population. The city's remaining inhabitants are foreigners, many of whom are profiteers or adventurers seeking either to plunder Chult of its riches or to help protect the city against encroaching monsters.

### Volothamp "Volo" Geddarm
Characters can encounter Volo anywhere in Port Nyanzaru. For more information on him, see *appendix D*.

The legendary world traveler is in Port Nyanzaru to deliver signed copies of his new book, *Volo's Guide to Monsters*, to the merchant princes (some of whom he knows well, and others he claims to know well), and to promote his latest work. Characters are most likely to encounter Volo in one of the city's inns or taverns, or in a merchant prince's villa.

Volo is a font of information, but not everything he says is true, despite his hearty avowals of accuracy. He won't venture outside Port Nyanzaru under any circumstances.

If the characters buy a copy of Volo's book (50 gp for a durable hardcover edition), they can put it to use. Any time they want to know lore about a particular monster described in the book, give them useful tidbits from *Volo's Guide to Monsters*. Do not impart game statistics, since such information would not be available in-world. If this reference is unavailable, use the information in *appendix D*.

### Merchant Princes
Seven merchant princes rule Port Nyanzaru, each one with an equal vote in matters of state. All are Chultan. Their single qualification is that they're the seven richest people in the city. Their seat of governance is Goldenthrone, an old, regal Amnian palace overlooking the bay. A merchant prince who retires can yield his or her position to a family member or someone else of immense wealth agreed on by the majority.

The merchant princes surround themselves with loyal family and underlings, but they also employ foreign mercenaries both as city guards and as personal guards. Most of these mercenaries are Zhents, and where one finds the Zhentarim, one can also find Harper spies.

The merchant princes have specific monopolies on all merchandise sold in the city. Characters in need of gear or supplies must deal through these individuals directly or their consortiums indirectly. The only alternative is to resort to the black markets in Malar's Throat or Tiryki Anchorage.

#### Ekene-Afa
![[007-0203.webp|right|300]]

*Deals in weapons, shields, traveling gear, rain catchers, saddles, wagons, and canoes*

**Ekene-Afa** (LG female Chultan human **gladiator**) won numerous gladiatorial contests in Port Nyanzaru's arena before she invested her winnings into financing her first trade deals. She is a legend among the common rabble who grew up watching her battles. Her husband, Kura, is a painter, and they have twin teenage sons named Soshen and Tiryk. Soshen is a city guard, and Tiryk is a popular dinosaur racer. Both were named after Chultan rivers.

**Ekene-Afa** sells nonmagical weapons and shields of every kind, but most of her inventory consists of flint daggers, yklwas with wooden shafts and obsidian tips (see "Buying a Special Item"), and shields made of wooden frames with layers of reptile hide stretched over them. **Ekene-Afa** pays **Wakanga O'tamu** to place permanent enchantments on a select few of these items, which she sells at the prices listed in the Magic Shields and Weapons for Sale table.

#### Magic Shields and Weapons for Sale

| Item | Ekene-Afa's Price |
|---|---:|
| *+1 ammunition* (per piece) | 50 gp |
| *+1 shield, wooden* | 450 gp |
| *+1 dagger* or *+1 yklwa* | 500 gp |

#### Ifan Talro'a
![[008-0204.webp|right|300]]

*Deals in beasts and beast training*

**Ifan Talro'a** (NE male Chultan human **noble**) is a greedy, conniving man supported by influential and dangerous friends among the Zhentarim. He is jealous of **Wakanga O'tamu**'s magical power and **Ekene-Afa**'s reputation from the arena. Talro'a sells animals that can be trained as mounts or pets, including dinosaurs and flying monkeys. The yuan-ti of Omu secretly pay Talro'a to warn them if treasure hunters are headed south into the deep jungle. He uses flying snakes as messengers. Talro'a doesn't know for certain that the messages go to yuan-ti, but he strongly suspects it.

Ifan has no family and no close relationships. He is naturally distrustful of everyone.

***Buying Beasts.*** **Ifan Talro'a** employs dozens of merchants throughout Port Nyanzaru who not only serve as his spies but also sell domesticated beasts that can be used as companions, mounts, or pack animals. Flying snakes trained as messengers are popular with the Zhentarim, and Talro'a sells them to no one else.

The Beasts for Sale table lists the creatures available for purchase in Port Nyanzaru. Statistics for the hadrosaurus, the deinonychus, and the flying monkey appear in appendix D. See the *Monster Manual***for all others.

#### Beasts for Sale

| Beast | Ifan's Price |
|---|---:|
| **Flying monkey**, **giant lizard**, or **hadrosaurus** | 100 gp |
| **Ankylosaurus**, **deinonychus**, or **flying snake** | 250 gp |
| **Triceratops** | 500 gp |

#### Jessamine
![[009-0205.webp|right|300]]

*Deals in plants, poison, and assassination*

**Jessamine** (N female Chultan human **assassin**, her hit point maximum reduced to 58) doesn't speak often. When the council finds itself divided on an issue, however, **Jessamine** usually casts the deciding vote. Most of her body is hidden under billowy robes and tightly wrapped black bandages.

**Jessamine** trades in plants, herbs, poison, and sanctioned assassination. Murder is illegal in Port Nyanzaru, as it is almost everywhere, but **Jessamine** has a monopoly on "sanctions"—writs that allow a killing by ordained methods (usually poison or stabbing with a blade). For an added fee, her agents will carry out the assassination, with results guaranteed. Poison is her specialty, and she has a vast personal collection. She sells all the poisons listed in the Poisons table in *chapter 8* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* at market prices.

Twelve years ago, **Jessamine** had a brief but torrid love affair with an Amnian sea captain. The "fruit" of that affair is a shy daughter named Ymezra. Under **Jessamine**'s watchful eye, tutors are teaching Ymezra the skills she needs to take over the family business one day.

***Jessamine's Curse.*** Before she went into business for herself, **Jessamine** worked as an assassin for a Calishite pasha. She died on a mission, but her benefactor paid a handsome price to raise her from the dead. As a result of her misfortune years ago, **Jessamine** is now suffering from the effects of the Soulmonger's death curse. She covers her rotting flesh with scarves and bandage wrappings, and she is predisposed to help any adventurers actively trying to end the death curse.

#### Jobal
![[010-0206.webp|right|300]]

*Deals in guides and sellswords*

**Jobal** (NE male Chultan human **scout**) made a fortune as a wilderness guide when the party he was working for discovered a stunning cache of Chultan gold and jewels. Miraculously, only **Jobal** survived the gauntlet of undead and dinosaur attacks, making it back to Port Nyanzaru in a canoe laden with treasure. There's no doubt he's led a life of adventure; his body bears many scars from his escapades. His chief spy, confidante, and consort is Aazon Talieri (NG male Tethyrian human **spy**). **Jobal** trusts him implicitly, and Aazon's loyalty is beyond reproach.

Because of his dealings with explorers, **Jobal** has an intense interest in maps of Chult. He would pay the characters handsomely for **Syndra Silvane**'s map, if he learns of its existence. If they refuse to sell, he'll resort to theft, and eventually to murder.

***Hiring a Guide.*** If the characters visit **Jobal** in search of a guide, he recommends that they seek out one or more of his guides in Port Nyanzaru (see "Finding a Guide"). **Jobal** assigns Aazon the task of escorting the adventurers to whichever guides interest them. **Jobal** doesn't require payment up front, since all guides in Port Nyanzaru are required by law to pay him a fair cut of their earnings.

If the characters follow **Jobal**'s advice and accompany Aazon, give them copies of handouts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 (see *appendix E*) as Aazon introduces the party to various guides in the city.

#### Kwayothé
![[011-0207.webp|right|300]]

*Deals in fruit, wine, ale, tej, oil, perfume, and insect repellent*

Kwayothé (NE female Chultan human **priest** wearing a *ring of fire resistance*) is calm and contemplative in a way that's vaguely menacing. She worships the fire god Kossuth (pronounced kaw-SOOTH) and likes torturing others, particularly if it involves fire and hot coals. Kwayothé has two consorts—a **succubus** named Ixis and an **incubus** named Indar. These fiends take the forms of beautiful Chultans.

Kwayothé grew up in the streets of Port Nyanzaru, poor and destitute. She despises nobility and wants to destroy every last vestige of the Chultan royal families. She considers **Zhanthi** her mortal enemy and has grown impatient waiting for the old noblewoman to die. Although she hides her contempt well, Kwayothé is forever meddling in **Zhanthi**'s business and family affairs. If **Zhanthi** is aware of Kwayothé's hostility toward her and her family, she's elected not to show it.

Kwayothé employs traders who make their own tej and insect repellent. For more information on these special items, see "Buying a Special Item."

#### Wakanga O'tamu
![[012-0208.webp|right|300]]

*Deals in magic and lore*

**Wakanga O'tamu** (LN male Chultan human **mage**) is the only arcane spellcaster among the merchant princes. He's a long-time friend of **Syndra Silvane**, and he's something of a dandy who's easily seduced by smart women—or perhaps that's only a carefully constructed public image. Unknown to his peers, Wakanga is sympathetic to the Harpers and allows them to use his villa as a safe house.

Wakanga deals in knowledge, information, lost lore, potions, and scrolls. He knows of the death curse but little else about it. If the characters seem committed to ending the curse, he'll help them as best he can, including selling them minor magic items (see the Magic Items for Sale table). Wakanga has a monopoly on these items in Port Nyanzaru, so characters either pay his prices or go without. As much as he wants to help, he's unlikely to extend credit; all purchases must be in coin, gemstones, or jewelry.

#### Magic Items for Sale

| Item | Wakanga's Price |
|---|---:|
| Potion, common | 80 gp |
| Potion, uncommon | 300 gp |
| *Spell scroll*, 1st-level | 100 gp |
| *Spell scroll*, 2nd-level | 550 gp |

***Wizard's Journal.*** In his collection, Wakanga has a tattered, water-damaged explorer's journal that was brought out of the jungle 15 years ago. It describes a wizard's explorations of various places in Chult, but not in enough detail to locate them on a map. The unnamed author does, however, make many mentions of his only traveling companion: a shield guardian named Vorn. If the characters befriend Wakanga, he gives them the journal and shows them on Syndra's map where it was found (he accurately indicates the hex containing the guardian; see "Vorn" in chapter 2 for more information). The journal contains a picture of Vorn's control amulet but provides no clues to the amulet's current whereabouts. As reward for finding and retrieving the construct and its control amulet, Wakanga offers a spellbook containing fifteen randomly determined spells (roll a d6 to determine the level of each spell).

#### Zhanthi
![[013-0209.webp|right|300]]

*Deals in gems, jewelry, cloth, and armor*

**Zhanthi** (NG female Chultan human **noble**) has royal blood in her veins, and few have the courage to dispute the wise, old trader. She's a secret member of the Ytepka Society (see "Factions and Their Representatives"), and she has forged ties with the Zhentarim so that she can monitor the organization's activities.

**Zhanthi** trades in gems, jewelry, colorful Chultan cloth, and nonmagical leather, studded leather, and hide armor. Her son, **Shago**, is a guide stationed at Fort Beluarian. **Shago** sends regular reports to his mother about what's happening at the fort, but he's not her most reliable spy among the Flaming Fist.

**Zhanthi** is one of very few people who've stumbled onto evidence of **Liara Portyr**'s secret arrangement with the pirates, but she keeps this knowledge to herself for the time being. **Zindar**, the half-dragon harbormaster, is looking for adventurers to dispose of the pirates, while **Zhanthi** is putting up the reward money.

## Merchant Prince's Villa
Each merchant prince maintains a lavish villa where he or she lives and conducts private business. These airy, opulent mansions include guest quarters for important visitors and trading partners, and they're patrolled by loyal, well-drilled guards at all hours.

Map 1.2 provides a sample floor plan. Each villa is both a palatial tropical home and a fortress. The outer walls are 8 to 12 feet tall, up to 2 feet thick, and topped with carnivore teeth, slivered seashells, and broken glass that glitters colorfully in the sun but also deters intruders. Any character who climbs over the wall must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 (1d4) slashing damage from the sharp objects.

You can customize a villa by assigning the following decorative motifs to each merchant prince:

- Ornate weapons, shields, and framed paintings are displayed throughout **Ekene-Afa**'s villa, as are squawking parrots in gilded cages.
- **Ifan Talro'a** decorates his villa and gardens with relics and vases plundered from Chultan ruins, and colorful **flying snakes** swoop and glide through the spacious hallways.
- The walls and pillars in **Jessamine**'s villa are painted with colorful serpents, and decorative stone fountains and fonts share a similar serpentine motif.
- The walls of **Jobal**'s villa are festooned with silk draperies, tapestries, and the mounted heads of beasts.
- Kwayothé's villa reeks with scented perfumes, and bowls of fresh fruit can be found throughout. Oil lamps and braziers are kept lit on honor of Kossuth.
- Wakanga's villa is lit with *continual flame* spells, and soft music (created by magic) plays throughout. Doors to private chambers have *arcane lock* spells cast on them, and **flying swords** are mounted on the walls, ready to attack on Wakanga's command. The occasional floor rug or hanging rug might be a **rug of smothering** in disguise.
- **Zhanthi**'s villa is decorated with standing suits of gold-plated armor and large potted plants, and the bejeweled skulls of **Zhanthi**'s ancestors rest in wall niches.

### Lower Level
Paintings, statues, murals, frescoes, tapestries, and oil lamps meant to impress guests decorate this level.

#### 1. Entryway
This pleasant, breezy, tiled courtyard includes a splashing fountain and green plants. Visitors can refresh themselves in a washroom to the left of the entrance before meeting residents of the villa. The entry portico is always guarded by 1d4 + 1 **gladiators** recruited from the merchant prince's extended family or hand-picked for their loyalty and fighting prowess. These guards are always on alert against tricksters and magicians trying to gain entrance to their master's home, so they have advantage on skill checks and saving throws against attempts to distract, bamboozle, or charm them.

The ceiling of the entryway is two stories tall. In some homes, it's open to the sky. In those cases, the fountain is sunk into the floor and doubles as a drain for rainwater.

#### 2. Sitting Area
This is both a waiting area and a meeting area for guests who aren't known to the villa's master, and therefore won't necessarily be given access to the inner chambers of the house. Decorative columns support the arched doorway from area 1. Rugs and comfortable pillows are arranged on the floor. Narrow windows look into the garden, but these double as arrow slits in case visitors aren't as friendly as they claim to be.

#### 3. Grand Hall
A magnificently tiled floor is flanked by two sweeping staircases that ascend to the upper floor. Decorations are in keeping with the individual merchant prince's taste and specialization.

#### 4. Guest Rooms
Most of the right side of the house is devoted to accommodations for guests. Three private sleeping rooms with attached baths, plus two sitting rooms and access to the garden, make this far more luxurious than a typical inn.

#### 5. Garden
Ferns, potted palms, orchids, and other tropical flowers are cultivated in the garden, which is open to the sky. Chultan plants with useful properties or applications as poison might be found in the garden of a merchant prince with a horticultural bent, such as **Jessamine**. See *appendix C* for examples of rare plants.

#### 6. Dining Room
The dining table is very low, just a few inches above the floor. Diners relax on pillows as they eat.

#### 7. Sauna
In addition to daily baths, well-to-do Chultans love relaxing in saunas. Dry heat is a welcome change from Chult's high humidity. Most home saunas are heated with charcoal burners or hot stones, but in the homes of the merchant princes, a trapped **fire elemental** provides round-the-clock heat, and a servant or slave is always available to massage tired muscles.

#### 8. Bath
The bath is the cornerstone of a Chultan mansion, even more so than the dining room or family rooms. The family relaxes here during private times, but there's nothing unusual about a merchant prince holding meetings in the bath with trusted advisors and close business associates. Being invited into the household bath is considered an honor in Chultan society, and treating it as anything less than an honor risks offending the person who extended the invitation.

#### 9. Kitchen
The kitchen is large, high-ceilinged, and well ventilated; otherwise, heat from cooking fires would make it unbearably hot. Stairs lead up to the laundry room (area 14).

### Upper Level
The rooms on this level are decorated for comfort. The artwork and other decor reflects the taste of the merchant prince to whom the villa belongs.

#### 10. Library
Chultans are fans of mythical romance, and the city has an active literary community with many book clubs. Port Nyanzaru's most successful novelists and playwrights concoct stirring tales about legendary heroes who pursue their lovers through unimaginable danger and save them from fates worse than death—which is more likely to involve a forced marriage to someone who doesn't love them than being eaten by an impossibly huge tyrannosaurus, although monstrous tyrannosauruses make regular appearances in these tales, too.

A character who spends a few hours sifting through the formulaic fiction and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds useful books of Chultan lore mixed in with the romances. Use this as an opportunity to answer specific questions posed by the players. A library won't reveal the location of Omu, but a book of lore might mention the city and describe it as it was during its height.

#### 11. Family Rooms
The merchant prince's children, spouses, and other close family members live in these apartments. They are richly appointed with pillows and tiger-skin rugs.

#### 12. Master Suite
The merchant prince's suite is the most opulent room in the palace. A pleasant breeze blows through large, lattice-covered windows, causing the potted plants to sway gently. The headboard of the master bed is fantastically carved in motifs suggestive of the merchant's business. Connected rooms contain a small, private bath and a walk-in closet filled with expensive clothing, mirrors, combs, and so forth.

***Treasure.*** The suite contains personal items equivalent to two rolls on the "Gems or Art Objects" column of the Treasure Hoard, Challenge 0–4 table in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. If the room contains jewelry, there is a 50 percent chance it is in a locked jewelry box requiring thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open.

#### 13. Guard Rooms
This guard room is intentionally set in the midst of the family rooms and the master suite. The guards are responsible for safeguarding the family during their most vulnerable time, when they're sleeping or relaxing in their own chambers. This station is always manned by 1d4 + 1 **gladiators** who are fanatically loyal to the merchant prince and richly rewarded for their devotion.

#### 14. Laundry Room
Chultans are as scrupulous about their clothing as about their bodies—a fastidiousness that's almost essential, given how much everyone sweats in Port Nyanzaru's climate. Laundry is washed here every day, then hours are spent fanning it to and fro on lines trying to encourage the wet cloth to dry in the humid air.

#### 15. Servants' Quarters
The servants' quarters are isolated from the family sleeping areas for security. There is nothing remarkable about them.

#### 16. Rain Traps
Every room in the house contains (at minimum) a small water basin with running water coming either from a rooftop basin or lifted from barrels or an underground cistern by a water wheel.

## Factions and Their Representatives
Port Nyanzaru is the lone civilized hub on a vast peninsula of great wealth. Many factions would like to tap into that wealth, and they all have agents vying for influence in the city or scouting the jungle for opportunities. Some of these can aid the characters, and others will try to hinder them.

> ##### Laws and Punishments
>The merchant princes can create or alter laws by decree as they see fit, and judges are expected to interpret laws freely but wisely. Such a system would seem to invite abuse and bribery, but the Chultan courts are surprisingly free of corruption.
>
>Slavery isn't illegal in Port Nyanzaru, but it's frowned upon, and the merchant princes won't do business with slavers or show them any legal favor.
>
>Murder is illegal, but "sanctions"—legal permission to kill someone or to have someone killed—can be purchased from the merchant prince **Jessamine**. The price depends on the prominence of the intended victim, the reason for the sanction, and the wealth of the purchaser. The minimum price possible is 150 gp; the maximum is limitless. The availability of sanctions doesn't mean they're common—it's rare for more than six to be sold in a year. That has less to do with price than with the fact that if word gets out who purchased a sanction, nothing can stop the friends of the victim from sanctioning the original purchaser.
>
>Despite their high ambition, the merchant princes' power is entirely contained in the city. Elsewhere, Chult is ruled by the red law of tooth and claw. An individual is either predator or prey, and the predator might be a mob of undead, a ravenous allosaurus, a grung hunting party, Jahakan pirates, or a Flaming Fist patrol.
>

### Emerald Enclave
The Emerald Enclave is a widespread group of wilderness survivalists who preserve the natural order by rooting out unnatural threats. They struggle to keep civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another.

In Chult, the Emerald Enclave is chiefly concerned with protecting inhabitants from the undead menace. A few guides in Port Nyanzaru and Fort Beluarian are openly associated with the enclave, and a few others are secret members or are sympathetic to its goals. The faction maintains several well-camouflaged outposts in the jungle. They serve as hidden observation posts, not forward fighting positions.

If characters get into trouble in the wilderness, the Emerald Enclave is a potential rescuer.

### Flaming Fist
The Flaming Fist is a mercenary company headquartered in (and fiercely loyal to) Baldur's Gate. The Fist maintains a permanent stronghold in Chult at Fort Beluarian. From there, Flaming Fist patrols strike out into the jungle to "pacify" territory and claim lost treasures. The Flaming Fist has already plundered the ruins of Mezro. Now the mercenaries and their wealthy backers in Baldur's Gate would like nothing better than to do the same to Omu, but they've had no luck locating the lost city. The Flaming Fist's researchers are convinced the city lies south of Lake Luo but east of the Peaks of Flame, at the western end of the Valley of Dread. Because of the distance from Fort Beluarian, they're looking for adventurers to conduct an initial exploration of that area and locate what they believe will be mostly abandoned ruins.

The commander of Fort Beluarian and highest ranking member of the Flaming Fist in Chult is **Liara Portyr** (see *appendix D*). She holds the rank of blaze (major) and has complete autonomy in Chult, answering only to Duke Ulder Ravengard of Baldur's Gate. Portyr will happily assign some of her mercenaries to accompany adventurers by sea to Refuge Bay or even to Snapping Turtle Bay—either is an excellent starting point for any incursion into the western reach of the Valley of Dread.

Only six ranks are recognized within the Flaming Fist: fist (private), gauntlet (corporal), manip (sergeant), flame (lieutenant), blaze (major), and marshal (general).

### Harpers
The Harpers are spellcasters and spies who covertly oppose any abuse of power, magical or otherwise. Working alone or in small cells, they gather information throughout Faerûn, analyze the political dynamics in each region or realm, and use what they uncover to help the weak, the poor, and the oppressed from behind the scenes. Harpers act openly only as a last resort.

**Artus Cimber**, a former member of the Harpers, is hiding out in Chult. He possesses an artifact called the *Ring of Winter*, and other Harpers are concerned lest the ring fall into evil hands. To prevent that, a handful of Harper spies are combing Port Nyanzaru and Chult for clues to Artus's whereabouts—ostensibly to protect the ring, but exactly what they'll do when they find it is an open question. Magical efforts to locate Artus are futile, as the *Ring of Winter* shields itself and its wearer against divination spells and scrying sensors.

### Lords' Alliance
A number of cities and settlements banded together to form the Lords' Alliance, a coalition that works actively to eliminate threats to their mutual safety and prosperity. The coalition is loose—some might even call it shaky. Alliance leaders push their own interests above counterparts from other cities, and operatives seek honor and glory for themselves and their own lords at the expense of less powerful members.

A key figure in the Lords' Alliance is Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard of Baldur's Gate, a city with a vested interest in the affairs of Chult. The flag of Baldur's Gate flies over the stronghold of Fort Beluarian, which is garrisoned by Flaming Fist mercenaries under the command of Ravengard's vassal, **Liara Portyr**. If push came to shove, Ravengard would place the priorities of Baldur's Gate above those of the Lord's Alliance.

Other Lords' Alliance cities such as Waterdeep and Neverwinter have operatives in Port Nyanzaru, where they undermine the efforts of non-alliance powers such as Calimshan, Amn, and Tethyr to expand their control over Chult's vast resources. Most of these representatives are open about their ties to the Lord's Alliance and style themselves as ambassadors of their cities, but they also employ covert agents to undermine each other's plans and carry out less savory tasks. The Lords' Alliance sponsors mapping expeditions into the peninsula, with the aim of finding more treasures or mines it can plunder.

### Order of the Gauntlet
Members of the Order of the Gauntlet vow to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. Placing their faith in good-aligned deities such as Torm, Helm, and Tyr, they bring the strength of their faith, their hearts, and their weapons to bear against villainy.

The order has committed considerable resources toward quelling the undead menace in Chult. Its forward base, Camp Righteous, was overrun by undead. The order, undaunted, built a new fortification even deeper in the jungle. Dubbed Camp Vengeance, it has fallen on hard times. Its commander is a woefully inept noble named **Niles Breakbone**. His lieutenants are more likely to share useful information or offer aid, but only if the characters offer some form of assistance to Camp Vengeance in return.

All members of the Order of the Gauntlet are unflinchingly brave, but many of their expeditions fare poorly or meet with outright disaster when confronted by conditions that confound their training and contradict their mindset.

### Red Wizards of Thay
Red Wizards are in Chult to find and steal the Soulmonger for Szass Tam. They've occupied the Heart of Ubtao and are using it as a base. Their leader is **Valindra Shadowmantle**. She remains at the Heart of Ubtao while her Thayan minions comb the ruins of Omu for clues to the Soulmonger's whereabouts. For more information on Valindra, see "Heart of Ubtao."

### Ytepka Society
The Ytepka Society, also known as the Triceratops Society, is based in Port Nyanzaru and dedicated to preventing any individual or group from abusing power and upsetting the natural social order. Its members are primarily neutral good Chultans. In many respects, the society's goals are similar to those of the Harpers.

The Ytepka Society was instrumental in liberating Port Nyanzaru from foreign powers and facilitating the rise of the seven merchant princes. Its members now work tirelessly to prevent the Zhentarim and other dubious factions from taking over the government or gaining undue influence. The Ytepkas also work covertly to eliminate the threat from pirates, but they've been unable to locate the pirates' base or track down pirate spies in the city. A handsome reward awaits those who can definitively pinpoint the pirates' base or capture their ships.

Currently there are fewer than fifty active members of the Ytepka Society. They don't advertise their membership but identify one another using a simple hand gesture: a raised left hand with the index finger, middle finger, and third finger extended, representing the three horns of the triceratops.

When the society judges that someone has damaged the social fabric of Chult or is on the verge of committing a great wrong, it presents a warning by anonymously delivering an iron token bearing the likeness of a triceratops. It's up to the marked individual to figure out the meaning of the token and take steps to correct the offending behavior or undo the damage. If the person ignores the warning and persists in offending the society, the Ytepkas secure permission from the merchant princes to mete out punishment as they see fit, up to and including a sanction (see the "Laws and Punishments" sidebar earlier in this chapter).

Unfortunately, because of the society's secretiveness, not many people understand what those iron tokens signify, and there's a lot of misinformation about the Ytepkas in Port Nyanzaru. The society doesn't recollect its tokens, either, so unscrupulous types have used old (or even counterfeit) tokens to frighten competitors away from business ventures.

### Zhentarim
The Zhentarim is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence and power base throughout Faerûn. Its members pursue wealth and power through any means, though the public face of the organization appears much more benign—the Zhentarim provides the best mercenaries money can buy.

The merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru hire Zhentarim guards to defend the city walls and Zhentarim mercenaries to protect hunting, lumbering, and mining operations in the jungle and foothills. The Black Network has used this wide-ranging access to the city to set up its own woodcutting camps and mining operations. It also mounts treasure-hunting expeditions. In addition, Black Network spies have learned that **Artus Cimber** is in Chult, and they've assembled teams to find the ex-Harper and wrest the *Ring of Winter* from him.

## Things to Do
Port Nyanzaru offers plenty of distractions for visitors, but the following sections describe four activities that the characters are likely engage in before setting out to explore the darkest reaches of Chult:

- Buying a special item
- Dinosaur racing
- Finding a guide
- Gathering information

### Buying a Special Item
![[016-0211.webp|right|300]]

Characters can easily find most mundane items for sale in any of Port Nyanzaru's markets, at standard prices. Anything needed to survive in the jungle is considered a mundane item in Chult. The chief exception is heavy armor, which is rare in Chult and thus commands a high price: triple the *Player's Handbook* prices for heavy armor, or double them if the character makes a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to bargain down the price.

The only alternative to buying specialty items through the merchant princes is to deal with the black market, which is highly secretive in Port Nyanzaru; the merchant princes crack down harshly on competitors. Contacting black marketeers takes half a day in the Old City, Malar's Throat, or Tiryki Anchorage, plus a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to pose the right questions to the right people at the right time. To determine the black market price of an item, multiply the item's normal price (see the *Player's Handbook* where appropriate) by 1d4 + 2. If an unusually large quantity is needed, increase the price multiplier by 1.

The following special goods are available for sale in Chultan markets.

#### Canoe
A canoe can be purchased in Port Nyanzaru for 50 gp. It holds up to six Medium creatures and has a maximum speed of 2 mph. It is otherwise identical to a rowboat (see chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

The sale of canoes in Port Nyanzaru is controlled by the merchant prince **Ekene-Afa**.

#### Insect Repellent
Insect repellent can be purchased in Port Nyanzaru in two forms: blocks of incense or a greasy salve. The merchant prince Kwayothé controls the sale of both. Neither kind of repellent protects against giant insects or the vile swarms of insects described in *appendix A* of the *Monster Manual*.

A block of incense sells for 1 sp. When lit, it burns for 8 hours and repels normal insects within a 20-foot-radius centered on it.

A gourd or vial of salve, which sells for 1 gp, contains 20 applications of odorless grease. One application protects its wearer against normal insects for 24 hours. The salve is waterproof so it doesn't wash off in rain.

#### Rain Catcher
A rain catcher is a simple contraption consisting of a 5-foot-square leather tarp and a wooden frame with legs. When the tarp is stretched across the wooden frame, it forms a basin that can catch 2 gallons of drinking water per inch of rainfall and hold up to 8 gallons. The tarp and wooden frame fold up for easy transport. A rain catcher costs 1 gp and weighs 5 pounds.

Merchant prince **Ekene-Afa** controls the sale of rain catchers in Port Nyanzaru.

#### Tej
Tej is an amber-colored, fermented drink made from honey. It's more common and popular in Chult than beer or ale. A mug of tej costs 4 cp in Port Nyanzaru or 6 cp in Fort Beluarian. A 1-gallon cask costs 2 sp in the city or 3 sp at the fort.

Sale of tej is controlled by the merchant prince Kwayothé.

#### Yklwa
A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. It costs 1 gp, and it deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing (range 10/30 ft.).

The merchant prince **Ekene-Afa** controls the sale of yklwas in Port Nyanzaru.

### Dinosaur Racing
The city is famous for its weekly dinosaur races through the streets. Dinosaurs are painted in bright designs, and their riders try to steer them along a course that winds around the harbor and the city's four hills. Spectators are seldom injured, but it's a dangerous sport for the dinosaurs and their riders.

A typical race day has three races: one for four-legged beasts, one for two-legged beasts, and one no-holds-barred "unchained" race. Many of the dinosaurs involved are juveniles, since fully grown versions can be too large and too difficult for riders to manage. The dinosaurs are stoutly muzzled and have their claws and horns blunted in all but the unchained race.

The four-legged race is dominated by young ankylosauruses and triceratopses, but dimetrodons have also done well when paired with Small riders. Most competitors in the two-legged race are hadrosauruses and deinonychuses (again with Small riders). The unchained race sees racers on anything, including young allosauruses and very young tyrannosauruses.

#### Betting on Dinosaur Races

| Odds | Roll | Win on | Payout = | Racer Example |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| 7:1 | d8 | 2–8 | Wager ÷ 7 | Big Honker (crowd-pleasing young tyrannosaurus rex) |
| 5:1 | d6 | 2–6 | Wager ÷ 5 | Ubtao's Favorite (young triceratops on a streak) |
| 3:1 | d4 | 2–4 | Wager ÷ 3 | Banana Candy (well-trained hadrosaurus) |
| 2:1 | d3 | 2–3 | Wager ÷ 2 | Bonecruncher (young, ill-tempered allosaurus) |
| 1:1 | Any | Even | Wager | Grung Stomper (young ankylosaurus) |
| 1:2 | d3 | 1 | Wager × 2 | Scarback (young tyrannosaurus rex on its last race) |
| 1:3 | d4 | 1 | Wager × 3 | Nasty Boy (allosaurus with famous trainer) |
| 1:5 | d6 | 1 | Wager × 5 | Jungle Princess (deinonychus with frightened jockey) |
| 1:7 | d8 | 1 | Wager × 7 | Mountain Thunder (aging dimetrodon) |

#### Racing Dinosaurs

| Mount | Speed | Skill Check DC | AC | Hit Points | Attack | Damage | Constitution |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Allosaurus, young | 50/80 | 16* | 13 | 30 | +6 | 8 (1d10 + 3) | 15 (+2) |
| Deinonychus | 40/60 | 12* | 13 | 26 | +4 | 6 (1d8 + 2) | 14 (+2) |
| Dimetrodon | 30/50 | 8 | 12 | 19 | +3 | 8 (2d6 + 1) | 15 (+2) |
| Hadrosaurus | 40/50 | 10 | 11 | 19 | +3 | 6 (1d10 + 1) | 13 (+1) |
| Other | 40/60 | 12 | 12 | 24 | +3 | 6 (1d8 + 2) | 16 (+3) |
| Triceratops, young | 50/75 | 14 | 13 | 38 | +5 | 6 (1d10 + 1) | 15 (+2) |
| Tyrannosaurus, young | 50/100 | 18* | 13 | 46 | +6 | 9 (1d12 + 3) | 17 (+3) |
* If an Animal Handling check made with advantage due to lashing fails by 5 or more, the animal goes berserk and is out of the race.

#### Betting
Characters can bet on the dinosaur races to help fund a jungle expedition or earn some extra cash. The racers, the available odds, and the chance to win are listed in the Betting on Dinosaur Races table. Bets can range from 1 cp to 500 gp. Once bets are placed, roll a die for each bet. Losing bets cost the full amount of the wager. Winning bets pay out according to the table. Bets can be for a dinosaur to win, place, show, or do something specific during the race (like attack another racer or throw its rider), so many bets can win in the course of a single race.

Losers are expected to pay up in a timely fashion. Those who don't are visited by a debt collector backed up by Chultan legbreakers (1d4 + 1 **thugs** or **gladiators**, depending on the level and reputation of the bettor). Port Nyanzaru bookies never forget a debt; even a year away on an expedition into the jungle isn't long enough to erase an unpaid gambling loss.

#### Racing
Player characters might get involved in a dinosaur race, either through their own interest or because they're approached by a racing team. In this case, you'll need to play out the race. This can be quite a bit of fun, especially if you let players whose characters aren't directly involved take over at least some of the NPC racers. Encourage everyone to race hard, even if it's in the group's best interest for a particular dinosaur to win.

A race runs a length of 300 feet; this is abstract, as a race actually covers a lot more ground. Every round, each rider makes a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check; the DCs for different types of dinosaurs are listed in the Racing Dinosaurs table. With each successful Animal Handling check, the first number listed as the dinosaur's speed is added to its "running tally." If the check fails, that dinosaur's tally doesn't increase that turn. When a racer's tally equals or exceeds 300, that dinosaur crosses the finish line. A racer can try to move at the higher listed speed by lashing the animal furiously; in this case, the Animal Handling check is made with advantage, but the dinosaur must also make a successful DC 10 Constitution check at the end of this round or its speed is halved for the rest of the race.

No initiative is involved. Riders can make their Animal Handling checks in any order, or all at the same time. If two or more dinosaurs cross the finish line on the same round, the one with the highest tally wins. If the tallies are the same, the racers tied. In the event of a tie, brawls are likely to break out in trackside betting pools.

In the unchained event, dinosaurs can attack other dinosaurs if their tallies are within 50 of each other at the end of a round. Each dinosaur's pertinent combat statistics are listed on the Racing Dinosaurs table. If a dinosaur has half or fewer of its starting hit points, the rider makes Animal Handling checks with disadvantage.

For simplicity, riders can't attack or be attacked, but DMs with a cruel streak might be tempted to relax that rule. Just be aware that if rider attacks are allowed, the event is more likely to become a straight-up dinosaur fight than anything resembling a race. Raising a dinosaur to be a racer is difficult and expensive. Most owners aren't willing to lose one—especially a fast one—in a weekly bloodfest.

### Finding a Guide
Guides can be retained in Port Nyanzaru or Fort Beluarian. All Port Nyanzaru guides must register and serve under the auspices of **Jobal**, who takes a princely cut of their earnings and findings. The Zhentarim also have a black market network in the city that provides guides. **Jobal** is aware that this network exists and makes it abundantly clear that guides who fail to register with him will be beaten, blinded, or beheaded.

Guides working for **Jobal** leave their contact information on message boards outside inns and taverns or at the harbormaster's office in Port Nyanzaru.

Several guides are described in this section. Some will work for free if characters agree to certain conditions. Otherwise, guides charge 5 gp per day, and payment for 30 days up front is standard, even if the expedition is expected to be shorter than that. A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check negotiates the price down to 4 gp per day, or 3 gp per day if the check succeeds by 5 or more. Alternatively, guides might forgo wages in exchange for an equal share of treasure.

You can roleplay preliminary meetings and conversations with guides, or simply describe all the available guides to the players and let them choose. To help the party select a guide, you can give players copies of handouts 2 through 10 in *appendix E*. These handouts give players a sense of each guide's personality. You can give the players several handouts at once, or provide handouts only for the guides they track down.

> ##### Guides as Party Members
>A guide who is hired by the adventurers becomes a NPC party member and receives an equal share of XP. However, the guide doesn't gain levels as player characters do.
>
>You can use the optional loyalty rule in *chapter 4* of the Dungeon Master's Guide to track the loyalty of a guide who isn't beholden to a secret master. Disloyal guides won't risk their lives to save player characters and might abandon the party entirely to preserve themselves. The guides described in this chapter have goals beyond helping the characters survive. Helping guides fulfill their personal goals increases their loyalty.
>
>A particularly loyal guide (loyalty score of 10 or higher) will follow characters into a dangerous location such as Omu or the Tomb of the Nine Gods. A tenuously loyal guide (loyalty score of 1 to 9) might choose to wait for the characters outside the location rather than abandon the party altogether.
>

#### Azaka Stormfang
*Weretiger (Port Nyanzaru*)

When the characters meet Azaka, give the players a copy of handout 2 in *appendix E*.

Azaka (NG female Chultan human **weretiger**) works out of Port Nyanzaru. She conceals her lycanthropy from the characters for as long as possible and will guide adventurers for free if they agree to help her retrieve an item that was stolen by the pterafolk of Firefinger. If questioned about the stolen item, Azaka responds only that it's a family heirloom: a wooden mask carved to resemble a tiger's face. It is actually a *mask of the beast* (see *appendix C*).

Azaka has wandered far and wide through the jungle in tiger form. She is acquainted with Saja N'baza, the powerful and wise guardian naga of Orolunga, and gladly leads characters to the naga if they're looking for guidance.

Azaka stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. She will not willingly spread her lycanthropic curse. She is also afraid of heights and will not willingly put herself in a situation in which she's in danger of falling more than 60 feet. Azaka's damage immunities do not protect her against damage from falling.

#### Eku
*Disguised couatl (Port Nyanzaru)*

When the characters meet **Eku**, give the players a copy of handout 3 in *appendix E*.

**Eku** is a **couatl** polymorphed into a middle-aged Chultan woman. She is one of the few who knows the location of Omu, although she doesn't advertise this fact. The couatl is looking for adventurers to help rid the jungle of the evil that infests it. She'll work only with good-aligned adventurers.

While in human form, **Eku** is clothed in light blue robes and carries a walking stick carved in the likeness of a stylized couatl. In this form, **Eku** stands 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 110 pounds. She is on good terms with the aarakocra of Kir Sabal, and she's made numerous treks to Nangalore to retrieve rare flowers. **Eku** also knows about the evil gargoyles that guard Omu, though she's never fought them, and the guardian naga of Orolunga, whose oracular abilities are legendary. If the characters hire her to guide them but aren't sure where to go, she recommends visiting the guardian naga.

**Eku** had great love and respect for the people of Mbala, who were tricked and eaten by a green hag named **Nanny Pu'pu**. **Eku** regards the hag as one of the greatest evils in Chult. If the characters travel anywhere near Mbala and **Eku** is with them, she asks them to help her rid the world of **Nanny Pu'pu** once and for all.

#### Faroul and Gondolo
*Incompetent fortune hunters (Port Nyanzaru)*

When the characters meet **Faroul** and **Gondolo**, give the players a copy of handout 4 in *appendix E*.

**Faroul** (NG male Calishite human **scout**) and **Gondolo** (CG male lightfoot halfling **scout** with 13 hit points) are two dandies down on their luck in Port Nyanzaru. Spoiled and pompous, **Faroul** was shipped off by his exasperated parents to Port Nyanzaru and told to make his fortune there. Bursting with coin and ready for adventure, **Faroul** brought along his carousing companion, **Gondolo**. Together, they thought they'd soon be living the high life on distant shores. Within a few months, they'd squandered most of **Faroul**'s cash at the dinosaur races and were in debt to numerous bookies and several merchant princes. The only thing they have to show for their months of debauchery is a flatulent racing **triceratops** named Zongo. They purchased it for the races, but it was hopelessly slow; now they use Zongo as a pack animal.

In desperation, **Gondolo** bought a treasure map from a fever-wracked explorer who needed cash to buy passage back to Baldur's Gate. Miraculously, the map accurately indicates the location of Needle's Bones. This hapless pair hope to be hired by adventurers on an equal-shares basis so they can lead the group to what they believe will be an easily claimed dragon's hoard.

**Faroul** is 5 feet 10 inches tall and 175 pounds. He tells great tales of his battle prowess but he uses his shortsword only in emergencies.

**Gondolo** is 3 feet 6 inches tall and 80 flaccid pounds. He fancies himself a poet, a pugilist, and a philosopher who'll make up important-sounding facts when he runs out of actual ones. He has a knack for narrowly escaping the jaws of peril and has the normal halfling's luck.

#### Hew Hackinstone
*Barmy dwarf dragon slayer (Port Nyanzaru)*

When the characters meet Hew, give the players a copy of handout 5 in *appendix E*.

Three years ago, Hew was part of a dwarven expedition seeking to reopen Wyrmheart Mine. The expedition encountered Tinder the red dragon. Hew alone escaped, and only after the dragon bit off his left arm. Hew wants to return to the mine and slay the dragon, but he needs a band of stout-hearted adventurers to help him. If the characters hire him as a guide, Hew says he can lead them wherever they want, but he'll only take them to Wyrmheart Mine.

**Hew** is a shield dwarf **berserker**, with these changes:

- Hew is chaotic neutral.
- He has Survival +4.
- He has resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.
- He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- He wields a battleaxe instead of a greataxe that deals 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage on a hit. Hew can't wield the weapon with two hands, since he's missing his left arm.

#### Musharib
*Albino dwarf (Port Nyanzaru)*

When the characters meet **Musharib**, give the players a copy of handout 6 in *appendix E*.

**Musharib** (LG male **albino dwarf spirit warrior**; see *appendix D*) will gladly serve as a guide out of Port Nyanzaru, but he is secretly looking for adventurers of the right skill and fortitude to help him reclaim Hrakhamar—or at least to sneak into its treasury and retrieve Moradin's Gauntlet, a dwarven relic. If there are any dwarves in the player characters' party, **Musharib** locks onto them and appeals to their love of dwarvenkind to aid him in reclaiming his clan's ancestral forge. In general, he directs his questions and answers to dwarves in the party unless there's no way around speaking to someone else.

**Musharib** is 4 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds. He carries a wooden maul named Skullbash. His armor is fashioned from the spatulate bones of dinosaurs, and it's gashed and scarred by weapons, claws, and teeth.

#### Qawasha and Kupalué
*Chultan druid and vegepygmy (Fort Beluarian)*

When the characters meet **Qawasha** and Kupalué, give the players a copy of handout 7 in *appendix E*.

**Qawasha** (NG male Chultan **druid**) is a member of the Emerald Enclave based in Fort Beluarian. The druid travels with a **vegepygmy** companion named Kupalué, a Chultan word that means "walking weed." **Qawasha** often refers to his companion simply as Weed. They communicate with each other using their own unique sign language. See *appendix D* for vegepygmy statistics.

**Qawasha** would like to rid the jungle of its undead menace, so he deliberately leads adventurers through undead-infested regions. As he travels through the jungle, **Qawasha** calls out the names of unusual flora and fauna around him. The druid also has a knack for camping in places where chwingas (see *appendix D*) dwell, and he has experience dealing with the elemental spirits.

If the characters hire **Qawasha**, he recommends that they also purchase a charter of exploration before leaving Fort Beluarian. **Qawasha** has witnessed firsthand the Flaming Fist's mistreatment of adventurers who explore Chult without the requisite paperwork.

**Qawasha** stands 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 180 pounds. Weed stands 3 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds dry (50 pounds wet).

#### River Mist and Flask of Wine
*Tabaxi siblings (Port Nyanzaru)*

When the characters meet **River Mist** and **Flask of Wine**, give the players a copy of handout 8 in appendix E.

**River Mist** and **Flask of Wine** (CG female and male **tabaxi hunters**; see *appendix D*) are siblings in league with the Zhentarim. Consequently, they pay no fees or fealty to any merchant prince; they keep their business quiet, meeting potential clients only in Malar's Throat or seedier houses in Tiryki Anchorage. They refer to one another as River and Flask.

River is about 5 feet 5 inches and 100 pounds. She wears leather armor and an eye patch. (She lost her right eye in a childhood mishap involving a sling.) River is furtive and uncomfortable in crowds, preferring the jungle where she is truly at home.

Flask seldom speaks except to agree with River, often repeating the last few words of River's utterance (with a slight lisp) while nodding in assent. Despite this laconic nature, he enjoys being among people and might even be considered gregarious, for a tabaxi. He is tall and lanky (5 feet 8 inches and 140 pounds).

River and Flask can guide characters to Firefinger and Dungrunglung. They've also heard stories about an old woman in Mbala who can animate the dead in such a way that the zombies retain the abilities and memories they had in life.

Zhentarim agents in Port Nyanzaru have instructed River and Flask to keep an eye out for **Artus Cimber**. If they encounter Artus, the tabaxi try to learn as much as they can about him. The next time they return to Port Nyanzaru, the tabaxi report what they've seen and learned to their Zhent masters unless they're incentivized not to.

#### Salida
*Yuan-ti spy (Port Nyanzaru)*

When the characters meet **Salida**, give the players a copy of handout 9 in *appendix E*.

**Salida** (NE female Chultan **yuan-ti pureblood** with Survival +5) poses as a human guide in Port Nyanzaru, but she really works for **Ras Nsi**. She keeps him apprised of the activity of anyone who's heading south in search of Omu. They communicate via *sending stones*. **Salida** keeps her *sending stones* in a pouch and tries to join the player characters' expedition as a guide, a warrior, or even as a lowly bearer or paddler.

**Salida** is 5 feet 4 inches tall and 120 pounds. She is fit and completely looks the part of a seasoned explorer. Her garb covers up the scaly patches of skin that betray her true nature. **Salida** is skilled at crafting colorful insults and concocting believable lies to cover her true background. Her wit makes her an enjoyable traveling companion—a trait that she leverages to the fullest to join the characters' expedition.

#### Shago
*Chultan gladiator (Fort Beluarian)*

When the characters meet **Shago**, give the players a copy of handout 10 in *appendix E*.

**Shago** (CG male Chultan **gladiator** with Survival +7) is a Chultan and the only son of **Zhanthi**, one of Port Nyanzaru's merchant princes. He works out of Fort Beluarian, and although he presents himself as an independent operator, he's in league with the Flaming Fist. **Shago** has led many Flaming Fist expeditions into the jungle to clear out undead, despite having a great fear of being turned into a zombie or ghoul.

Despite his fears, **Shago** knows that the undead must be defeated. This is why he works with the Flaming Fist; the merchant princes bemoan the threat from undead but, other than hiring guards to defend Port Nyanzaru, they won't pay to take effective action against it. His mother believes she's "recruited" him to keep an eye on the Flaming Fist, but his sympathies are with the mercenaries and he rarely provides her with any secret or useful information.

**Shago** is 6 feet 3 inches tall and 220 pounds, with rippling muscles and a friendly smile. His main goal is to impress **Liara Portyr** enough to earn a rank within the Flaming Fist. While **Shago** is their guide, characters gain advantage on Charisma checks made to influence members of the Flaming Fist.

### Gathering Information
The challenge for characters isn't getting people to tell them about Chult; it's sifting the truth from the mountain of rumor, conjecture, and myth.

The best people to talk to are those who actually work or live in the jungle: hunters, guides, and explorers. No skill checks are necessary to get people talking, but to acquire reliable information, characters must go where in-the-know folks gather. For each hour spent talking to knowledgeable travelers, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. If the check succeeds, roll percentile dice and consult the Chult Rumors table to determine what the character learns.

#### Chult Rumors

| d100 | Rumor |
|:---:|---|
| 01–05 | Bird folk inhabit a monastery that hangs on the side of a plateau many miles up the Olung River, past the Laughing Gorge. The bird folk are holding the last royal heir of Chult as their prisoner. |
| 06–12 | Deep in the heart of the jungle is a city built by minotaurs. It's now overrun by snake people, but even worse things dwell below. In visions, I have seen strange devils screaming in the dark. |
| 13–17 | If you head up the Tiryki River about five days by canoe, you'll see a stone spire to the east. Natives call it Firefinger. "Terror folk" nest there, and if they spot you, you're in for a fight. |
| 18–22 | One must purchase a charter of exploration at Fort Beluarian before undertaking any jungle expedition. The Flaming Fist punishes explorers who don't have the required paperwork. |
| 23–28 | Chult had many kings and queens, but none more beautiful than Queen Zalkoré. Thousands of warriors killed and died for her, but the only memorial of her reign is the garden palace of Nangalore, which lies near the eastern shore of the River Olung, north of Lake Luo. |
| 29–33 | Chult was once a playground for a green dragon. Her bones mark the location of a hidden treasure trove. If you travel to Mezro and head east across the Laughing Gorge, then south toward Kir Sabal, you might stumble on the dragon's bones and earn yourself a place in the history books! |
| 34–40 | The city of Mezro was not destroyed during the Spellplague after all. Its ruins are an illusion. I heard a pale-skinned man whisper this to a dinosaur man with a big sword. The dinosaur man smelled like honeysuckle. |
| 41–45 | Dwarves are determined to reclaim Wyrmheart Mine, but a red dragon lives there now. Haven't seen one of them in a while. |
| 46–50 | The jungle is full of nature spirits—weird little elemental creatures with masks. They don't speak, and I've never known one to be harmful, but their magical powers should not be taken lightly. |
| 51–55 | Some city folk were expecting the arrival of a Halruaan airship called the *Star Goddess*. It never arrived. I bet it crashed in the jungle somewhere. |
| 56–60 | There are giant snapping turtles in Snapping Turtle Bay. One of them is as big as a house. He's known as King Toba, and his shell has gemstones embedded in it. |
| 61–65 | The Order of the Gauntlet came here to cleanse the jungle of undead. They lost one of their encampments not too long ago. They're just barely hanging on to another one. I see their emissaries all the time, heading up the River Soshenstar in canoes to get more supplies and templars from Port Nyanzaru. |
| 66–71 | Watch out for any mist with a blue tinge to it. It spreads a fever that drives people mad. |
| 72–77 | A dragon turtle named Aremag lives in the Bay of Chult. If you wish to set sail from Port Nyanzaru, you'll need treasure to appease the greedy monster. How much treasure, I can't say. Aremag will tell you what it wants, and you'd best give it what it demands. |
| 78–82 | A ruined city lies up the River Tath, past Kahakla Gorge. Supposedly, no one's explored past the gorge, but that's not true. It's just that the few who made it out alive mostly keep quiet about what they found there. I have it on good authority that the ruins are guarded by a naga who is both wise and generous. |
| 83–87 | The great god Ubtao once guided the people of Chult, be he tired of their constant warring and abandoned them. Since then, Chultans have turned to the worship of other gods, some of which were tricksters and deceivers. |
| 88–92 | Long ago, a peaceful tribe of fisherfolk called the Aldani angered Ubtao by catching and eating all the lobsters in a river. As punishment for their greed, they were all transformed into monsters that dwell in the Aldani Basin. |
| 93–96 | Perched atop a plateau overlooking the Aldani Basin is a ghost village. All the people there disappeared. No one knows why. You can reach the Aldani Basin by following the River Soshenstar. |
| 97–00 | The great god Ubtao loved mazes. If you happen upon a maze of any kind, trace a path through it. You will earn Ubtao's favor by doing so. |

# Chapter 2: The Land of Chult
![[017-0301.webp|right|300]]

When the adventurers mount their expedition into the heart of Chult, they have the option of striking out from any of several locations. Port Nyanzaru is the most obvious starting point. It offers easy access by canoe to two major rivers, the Soshenstar and the Tiryki. Journeys up these rivers make excellent shake-down expeditions for explorers just learning the ropes of this unforgiving land. Characters can also strike out from Fort Beluarian or travel by ship to coastal landing sites such as Jahaka Bay, Kitcher's Inlet, Refuge Bay, Shilku Bay, and Snapping Turtle Bay.

Chult is a land of adventure, and this chapter aims to make the characters' wilderness journey a memorable one. By design, the adventure locations are not tailored to characters of a specific level. If the adventuring party is relatively weak, it's up to the players to choose whether to flee instead of fight, negotiate instead of attack, or surrender instead of die. It's up to you as the DM to be flexible and keep the story moving forward as best you can. If an encounter is going badly for the adventurers, you can have the monsters suddenly withdraw, demand the party's surrender, or deal nonlethal damage. You can have an NPC show up to lend assistance. Mindless predators might be scared off by a sudden volcanic eruption or earth tremor. In short, there is always a way to turn the party's misfortune into a fighting chance of survival.

## The Expedition Begins
The sections that follow contain information that will help you run this part of the adventure smoothly. For each day that the party travels through the wilderness, follow these steps:

- Using the poster map, identify the hex in which the party is currently located. Don't share this information with the players if the party is lost; otherwise, show the players the party's location by pointing to the appropriate hex on their map of Chult.
- Let the players determine what direction the party wants to go, and whether the party plans to move at a normal pace, a fast pace, or a slow pace (see "Travel Distances" below).
- Let the players choose a navigator, then make a Wisdom (Survival) check on the navigator's behalf to determine if the party becomes lost (see "Navigation" below).
- Check for random encounters throughout the day (see *appendix B*).
- At the end of the day, check to see if any party members are dehydrated (see "Dehydration" below).

### Travel Distances
On the map of Chult, each hex measures 10 miles across. Characters moving at a normal pace can travel 1 hex per day on foot through coastal, jungle, mountain, swamp, or wasteland terrain. They can travel 2 hexes per day if they're traveling by canoe on a river or lake. The rate of travel up or down river is the same; the rivers are so sluggish that current is almost imperceptible. Without canoes, the normal rate of travel along a river is the same as through the surrounding terrain. Canoes move 1 hex per day through swamp.

If characters move at a fast pace, the easiest way to deal with their progress is to roll a d4. On a roll of 3 or 4, they advance 1 additional hex that day. Characters moving at a fast pace take a–5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, making them more likely to miss clues and walk into ambushes.

If characters set a slow pace, roll a d4. On a roll of 1 or 2, they advance 1 fewer hex that day (in other words, 1 hex by canoe or none by foot). On any other result, their caution is rewarded, and they travel the same distance as a group moving at a normal pace. Characters moving at a slow pace can move stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.

#### Tracking Miles
Instead of tracking movement by hexes, you can keep track of the actual distances covered (10 miles per day at a normal pace, 15 miles per day at a fast pace, or 9 miles per day at a slow pace), but this is likely to be more bother than it's worth if the group switches pace from day to day.

A character with a flying speed of 30 feet can travel 4 miles per hour.

> ##### Where's Artus Cimber?
>**Artus Cimber** and his traveling companion **Dragonbait** are good-aligned NPCs who can help the characters accomplish their goals. Both are described in *appendix D*. During the adventure, Artus and **Dragonbait** are either searching for Orolunga or gathering supplies and information in Port Nyanzaru. They can be encountered anywhere on the peninsula. Characters have a small chance of meeting Artus and **Dragonbait** as a random encounter (see *appendix B*).
>
>If Artus and **Dragonbait** don't appear as a random encounter, here are a few places where they might be found:
>
>- Camp Righteous (exploring the ruins)
>- The Heart of Ubtao (spying on the Red Wizards)
>- Jahaka Anchorage (trying to free prisoners trapped in the pirates' dungeon)
>- Kir Sabal (gathering information from the aarakocra or Princess Mwaxanaré)
>- Orolunga (consulting with Saja N'baza)
>- Literally anywhere in the jungle, fleeing from a pack of screaming **ghouls**, a horde of cannibalistic **tribal warriors**, or a **tyrannosaurus zombie** (see *appendix D*)

>Artus is reluctant to reveal why he's exploring Chult. He tries to get a sense of the characters' intentions before saying too much. Once he's confident that they're all on the same side, he'll swap whatever he knows (which is as much as you want to tell the characters) for whatever the characters know. Once Artus and **Dragonbait** become aware of the Soulmonger and the danger it poses, they're more than happy to help the party destroy it.
>
>Any party that includes Artus and **Dragonbait** will have an easier time overcoming the adventure's challenges. However, Artus is being hunted by the forces of evil. Frost giants, the Zhentarim, **Xandala** (see *appendix D*), **Valindra Shadowmantle** (see "Heart of Ubtao" later in this chapter), and the Red Wizards of Thay can appear at any time and try to capture Artus. If Artus believes that his presence is endangering the characters, he will leave the party and take **Dragonbait** with him.
>

### Navigation
Have the players designate one party member as the navigator. The navigator might be an NPC, such as a guide, and the party can switch its navigator day to day.

At the start of each new travel day, the DM makes a Wisdom (Survival) check on behalf of the navigator. The result of the check determines whether or not the party becomes lost over the course of the day. The DC of the check is based on the day's most common terrain: DC 10 for coasts and lakes, or DC 15 for jungles, mountains, rivers, swamps, and wastelands. Apply a +5 bonus to the check if the group sets a slow pace for the day, or a–5 penalty if the group is moving at a fast pace. It's possible to get lost on a river by following a tributary instead of the main branch.

If the check succeeds, the navigator knows exactly where the party is on the players' map of Chult throughout the day.

If the check fails, the party becomes lost. Each hex on the map is surrounded by six other hexes; whenever a lost party moves 1 hex, roll a d6 to randomly determine which neighboring hex the party enters, and do not divulge the party's location to the players. While the party is lost, players can't pinpoint the group's location on their map of Chult. The next time a navigator succeeds on a Wisdom (Survival) check made to navigate, reveal the party's actual location to the players.

![[018-0302.webp|right|300]]

### Dehydration
Characters who explore Chult need plenty of water to stay hydrated. The water found in rivers and on the ground is unfit for drinking unless it is boiled first. If they have a rain catcher (see "Buying a Special Item"), characters can use it to collect rain and then store the water in portable containers.

At the end of each day, any character who hasn't drunk at least 2 gallons of fresh water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. The saving throw is made with disadvantage if the character is wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or heavy clothing. Characters traveling at a fast pace, instead of a normal or slow pace, take a–5 penalty on their saving throws against dehydration.

Characters traveling with beasts of burden and other animals must keep them fed and hydrated as well. See "*Food and Water*" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for basic requirements based on creature size. Dinosaurs and other creatures native to Chult can forage for food and drink as long as they are in their native habitat.

### Diseases
The following diseases can affect giants and humanoids exploring the jungles of Chult. Remember that lesser restoration and similar magic can cure a disease.

#### Blue Mist Fever
A magical mist creeps through the jungles of Chult. Contact with this thin, blue, odorless mist can infect giants and humanoids with blue mist fever. A *dispel magic* spell destroys the mist in a 20-foot square starting at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range. An encounter with this mist typically covers 1d6 such areas (400–2,400 square feet).

A giant or humanoid that comes into contact with the mist must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with blue mist fever. An infected creature begins seeing vivid hallucinations of blue monkeys 1d6 hours after failing the save, and the hallucinations last until the disease ends on the creature. A creature can repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Shivering Sickness
Insects native to the jungles and marshes of Chult carry this disease, shivering sickness. The easiest protection against it is a coating of insect-repelling salve on all exposed skin (for the cost of insect repellent, see "Buying a Special Item").

A giant or humanoid that takes damage from insect swarms or from giant centipedes, giant scorpions, or giant wasps is exposed to the disease at the end of the encounter. Those who haven't applied insect repellent since their previous long rest are exposed to the disease when they finish a long rest.

A giant or humanoid exposed to the disease must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected. A creature with natural armor has advantage on the saving throw. It takes 2d6 hours for symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include blurred vision, disorientation, and a sudden drop in body temperature that causes uncontrollable shivering and chattering of the teeth.

Once symptoms begin, the infected creature regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from a long rest. The infected creature also has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. At the end of a long rest, an infected creature repeats the saving throw, shaking off the disease on a successful save.

#### Throat Leeches
Minuscule parasites known as throat leeches infect the water in Chult's forests, swamps, and rivers. Any giant or humanoid that swallows tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be infested with throat leeches. Immediate symptoms include throat inflammation and shortness of breath. After 1d6 hours, the infected character gains 1 level of exhaustion that can't be removed (except as described below) until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's exhaustion increases by 1 level; on a successful save, the creature's exhaustion decreases by 1 level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

Explorers can avoid contracting throat leeches by drinking only rainwater or water that's been boiled or magically purified.

> ##### A Cure for Dead Characters
>If a player character dies while exploring the wilds of Chult, an NPC guide might suggest that the party take its dead member to the ghost village of Mbala. A powerful witch is rumored to dwell there. According to local legends, the witch forged a pact with the Lord of Bones, a god who granted her the power to create zombies that retain their former personalities. For more information on the so-called witch, see "Mbala" later in this chapter.
>

### Random Encounters
Chult is home to an immense variety of plants, beasts, monsters, and intelligent beings. Random encounters with the local wildlife are inevitable and help to make the party's expedition a memorable one. *Appendix B* contains guidelines for generating random encounters in the wilderness.

#### Undead Territory
Undead creatures have nearly pushed human civilization off the peninsula, except for a few isolated outposts where Chultans and their allies take refuge behind walls. Map 2.1 shows where the undead are thickest. Characters passing through territories marked with black skull-and-bones icons are likely to have random encounters with undead. The likelihood of an undead encounter increases in territories marked with red skull-and-bones icons. Most guides know these territories well. Where undead are concerned, traveling by river is safer than traveling by land, both because undead are poor swimmers at best and because it's easier to pour on speed in canoes and escape across the water than to flee through tangled jungle.

## Locations in Chult
Map 2.1 depicts the Chultan peninsula with key locations marked. The same map appears on one side of the poster map. The remainder of this chapter describes these key locations, which are presented in alphabetical order for ease of reference.

If there's a particular site that you want the characters to discover and explore, you can move the site so that it falls along their path, and give it a new name if necessary. For example, the goblin village of Yellyark doesn't have to be in the location marked on your map. You can place it anywhere you want, or create another goblin village that has a similar configuration. Many other locations described in this chapter are just as adaptable. In addition to relocating a site, you can add or remove monsters and traps to make it harder or easier.

### Aldani Basin
The Soshenstar and Tath rivers flow out of this marshy upland basin, which is a popular feeding ground for dinosaurs and swarms of biting insects. Tall plateaus and walls of dense foliage enclose the marsh.

The basin is named after the aldani, a race of lobsterfolk (see *appendix D*). Many Chultans recall childhood fables about the eerie lobsterfolk that lived in the rivers and lakes of their homeland. No reliable witnesses have reported an encounter with aldani in decades, so most Chultans believe the aldani perished. In fact, the lobsterfolk retreated to the secluded lakes of this basin, where they've kept hidden for a century.

When the sky is clear, the Heart of Ubtao can be seen floating above the marsh from up to 50 miles distant (roll 1d4 each day to determine how many hexes away it's visible through the mist and heat haze). See "Heart of Ubtao," for more information on this location.

### Ataaz Kahakla
The river canyon called Ataaz Kahakla ("Gorge of Death") inspires wonder in most people who see it. The cliff walls, which vary from 50 to 200 feet high, are lined with row upon row of coral. It's all dead, but it retains its rainbow colors, making the canyon into a breathtaking, pseudo-underwater seascape. Mixed in among the corals are intact skeletons of plesiosaurs, giant sharks, and other sea creatures.

### Ataaz Muhahah
Shown in map 2.2, Ataaz Muhahah ("Laughing Gorge") is a gaping chasm crossed by an ancient stone span called the Monkey Bridge. The structure got its name from the monkeys that perch on its walls and hang by their tails from its underside. The monkeys are a mix of living monkeys and ancient carvings that are part of the bridge. Most of the carvings have been damaged by time, but the skilled artistry remains apparent.

The living monkeys chatter and shriek continually, and the gorge echoes with the sound of their cries. Occasionally, the echoes from up and down the gorge overlap in a way that transforms the cacophony into haughty, gloating laughter. When that happens, the terrified monkeys fall silent for several minutes as the "laughter" dies away before resuming their chatter.

![[019-0303.webp|right|300]]

Symbolic mazes are carved prominently onto the bridge and its supports. Any Chultan and most guides can confirm that maze symbols and the solving of mazes are associated with the ancient worship of Ubtao. A character can recall this information with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check.

#### Shrine of Ubtao

>>A stone shrine stands at the midpoint of the bridge. It consists of an imposing statue of a Chultan warrior wearing a war mask, hunkered down like a panther ready to pounce. Like the monkeys elsewhere on the bridge, the carving is highly stylized. Bright gems flash in its eye sockets.
>>
>>A human skeleton lies crumpled near the statue's feet. Several of its bones are obviously broken, but it's impossible tell whether these injuries happened while the person was alive or were caused by scavengers after death.
>>

The statue is, in fact, a **stone golem** created to defend the bridge against ancient invaders. It attacks anyone who desecrates it (including trying to remove its eye gems, which are purely decorative and worthless), who damages the bridge, or who passes the shrine without making the proper obeisance to Ubtao. The required homage involves placing a fingertip at the center of one of the bridge's mazelike carvings and tracing an unbroken path past the statue. Guides who are natives of Chult would know this. The symbolic labyrinths aren't terribly complex; the biggest difficulty comes from the lichens and moss growing over them. If these are cleared away with a knife or other tool before tracing the maze, it can be traced properly with a successful DC 5 Intelligence check. If it's not cleaned first, the DC increases to 10. If it's cleaned by scraping with bare hands, the golem interprets that as tracing the maze incorrectly and attacks. Tracing the maze with a dagger or other tool counts as nothing; it must be done with a finger.

If the golem has the opportunity in combat, it pushes enemies off the bridge. The golem is so heavy that it has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to resist being pushed. It doesn't pursue enemies off the bridge unless they continue using ranged attacks or spells against it after retreating.

The skeleton lying at the statue's feet is all that remains of a human explorer killed by the golem. It has long since been picked clean.

#### Bridge Gap

>>Part of the bridge has fallen away, leaving a 20-foot gap. The stone at either edge looks crumbly and unsafe.
>>

The 20-foot gap is too long for most characters to cross with a running jump. A jump from the high edge to the low edge, however, is effectively only 15 feet, while jumping from low to high is effectively 25 feet. Crumbling remains of the parapets shorten the distance by another 5 feet, but landing on one of those thin surfaces requires a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check; a jumper who fails that check slips off the stone and falls into the gorge (a 100-foot drop).

#### Hanging Vines
Hundreds of vines hang below the bridge. Characters can cross the gorge under the bridge by moving hand-over-hand from vine to vine and swinging across the gap. This doesn't activate the stone golem at all, but it requires two successful ability checks: a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to scramble across the vines and swing across the gap without falling, and a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) to make the passage without setting off a panic in the monkeys that consider the vines their home. If the Animal Handling check fails, the character is attacked by 1d4 **baboons**. The animals fight normally, but the character hanging in the vines has disadvantage on every attack roll and ability check while under attack.

### Ataaz Yklwazi
Blades of black basalt thrust up from the floor of this deep, volcanic canyon to create a forest of sorts: one that can easily draw blood from unwary trekkers who brush against the ebon piles that are as sharp as the razor-edged weapons they're named after.

Ataaz Yklwazi ("Gorge of Blades") forms a gateway of sorts to the Valley of Lost Honor from the north. The valley is the domain of firenewts. They protect it by patrolling the gorge and ambushing any intruders they believe they're strong enough to defeat. A typical patrol consists of four **firenewt warriors** mounted on **giant striders** (see *appendix D* for both creatures' statistics).

The gorge is also the favored hunting ground of a female **young red dragon** named Tzindelor, dubbed Tinder by those who've seen her and survived. The treacherous terrain is littered with the charred skeletons of Tinder's victims. If the characters take a long rest in the gorge, they encounter the dragon at the end of their rest. For more information on Tinder, see "Wyrmheart Mine."

### Bay of Chult
Ships must pass through the Bay of Chult as they come and go from Port Nyanzaru or the beaches west of Fort Beluarian. The mouth of the bay is watched over by Aremag, a **dragon turtle** with a blind, milky left eye and a piece of its shell missing. Aremag demands that ships toss treasure into the bay to appease it. Aremag then gathers up the loot and hides it in its lair, which no one has yet found.

![[020-0304.webp|right|300]]

If the characters enter or leave the Bay of Chult by ship, Aremag appears:

>>The sea ahead roils and churns, and waves crash over the bow of your ship, driven by saw-toothed hills rising from the heaving foam. Water streams off the rising crags like rivers crashing down a mountainside. At last the emerging island stops growing in size, although the sea around still tosses your ship like a drifting feather. Then a huge blast of steam erupts from the waves, and through the drifting, rainbow-crossed mist, you see an immense beak and a milky eye the size of a hogshead cask staring blindly in your direction. As the water calms, you also spot a dozen or more shark fins circling the ship.
>>

Aremag speaks first in Draconic; if no one answers intelligibly, it switches to Aquan.

During the negotiation, the dragon turtle slowly circles the ship. At first, characters must continually circle the deck of the ship to maintain face-to-face contact with the creature, but eventually it creates an eddy that causes the sloop to revolve at a rate matching Aremag's motion. It should be obvious to everyone that the dragon turtle could easily sink the vessel.

Aremag demands tribute for safe passage but doesn't specify an amount. Those aboard must throw valuables into a sack, in view of Aremag, until the dragon turtle is satisfied with the offering. Aremag extorts a different amount from every vessel, depending on how rich it suspects the cargo to be and how greedy it feels at the moment. To determine the minimum value in gold pieces Aremag will accept, roll 2d4 × 50 gp. As each fresh offering is displayed and added to the sack, the dragon turtle roars "More!" until the total reaches or exceeds its minimum. If characters act ridiculous about this—adding only a pittance at a time, for example—Aremag impatiently blows a blast of steam breath above the ship and slaps the hull with its tail, causing everyone not below deck to make a successful DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw or tumble overboard. The bay is full of **reef sharks**, and anyone who stays in the water more than 3 rounds is attacked by 1d4 of them.

Some negotiation is possible. A successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check can persuade Aremag that the passengers have no more to give, provided they've placed at least 50 gp of value into the sack. Only one character can make the check; others can aid, if they contribute a convincingly pitiable plea to the argument. The check is made with disadvantage if the sack contains less than 100 gp in value, or with advantage if the sack contains 150 gp or more. Every time this check is tried and failed, Aremag reacts as described above, as if characters were adding only a few gold pieces at a time.

When the offering is sufficient, Aremag announces "Heave it over!" The bag can be tossed onto Aremag's craggy back, into his mouth, or directly into the water. The dragon turtle submerges without further talk, causing the ship to pitch and roll violently until the sea calms down. Characters can watch the enormous disk of its shell swimming down into the clear water of the bay until it disappears in the lightless depths.

### Camp Righteous

>>You come upon an abandoned riverside camp strewn with wreckage. The tents are moldy and tattered, and all the permanent structures appear to have burned to the ground. Two intact rowboats are tied off to a short dock. North of the camp is a ridge, built into which is an 80-foot-tall stone statue carved to look like a man with a crocodile on his back. Between the statue's feet is a stone archway leading to a dark tunnel. To the left of the statue is a crude animal pen with a small, panicked bird running around inside it. There are no other signs of life.
>>

When the Order of the Gauntlet first brought its war against undead to Chult, its members established this base camp (map 2.3) around an ancient Chultan shrine, which local guides call the House of the Crocodile. The shrine wasn't the focus of the order's activity, but it was an object of intense curiosity. Despite being in ruins, the shrine's traps were still active, and they overcame the order's attempts to reach the heart of the shrine.

The overconfident visitors neglected to build defenses around the camp, believing that their own strong arms were sufficient protection. A couple months ago, they were proved tragically wrong when hundreds of undead swarmed out of the jungle and overran the camp. Only a handful of warriors escaped from that slaughter. No bodies remain in the camp; the remains of everyone who died defending it have either been buried by the second wave of templars (now at Camp Vengeance) or dragged away by jungle scavengers.

When characters arrive, the camp is being watched by a party of Batiri goblins consisting of two **goblins** per player character. Leading the group is a **goblin boss** named Yokka. The goblins wear wooden masks and hide in the foliage north of the camp. They believe the shrine is cursed, so they avoid it. However, Yokka had a vision of a treasure inside the shrine that could make him a great figure in his tribe, so he and his followers have spent the last tenday trying to work up the courage to tackle the shrine's traps. The arrival of adventurers is a great boon from Yokka's point of view. If they defeat the shrine's traps, he can simply take its treasure from them as they emerge. If they don't, they might at least weaken the shrine's defenses.

Yokka's band bedevils the party without revealing its presence until the final moment. For example, if no guard is left to watch over the party's boats, the goblins steal them or knock holes in their bottoms. If all the party members enter the shrine, the goblins set up an ambush outside. If all else fails, the goblins use horns and animal calls to draw the attention of nearby undead (1d8 **zombies** and 1d8 **skeletons**) or aggressive beasts (a hungry **allosaurus** and 1d4 + 1 **axe beaks**).

![[022-0305a.webp|right|300]]
#### 1. Command Tents
Templars from the Order of the Gauntlet removed everything of value from these tents when they came to inspect the scene of the disaster. A character who pokes around in one of these tents has a 1-in-6 chance of stirring up a **poisonous snake**.

#### 2. Soldiers' Tents
All the tents are ruined one way or another. Most were slashed by claws or weapons during the fight, and all the canvas is at the point of disintegration from mildew and jungle rot.

#### 3. Burned-Out Shrine
During the battle, overturned lamps started fires in the templars' partially built shrine, setting ablaze the stockpile of material that was meant to become permanent barracks. All that remains is a burnt-out ruin.

***Treasure.*** A silver holy symbol of Torm (25 gp) still hangs by a leather thong from a peg on the shrine wall, overlooked until now.

#### 4. Animal Pens
The templars kept swine in this pen for food. They're long gone, but a fledgling **axe beak** with 6 hit points and no effective attacks (0 XP) has gotten itself trapped inside the enclosure. If characters leave it alone or set it loose, it causes no problems. If they attack or harass the bird, its squawks attract five adult **axe beaks**, which crash out of the jungle 2 rounds later, ready to fight whatever they meet.

#### 5. Latrines
During the attack on the camp, one templar's courage failed him, and he hid from the undead by climbing down into the southernmost latrine. He survived the attack but couldn't climb out of the reeking pit by himself, and he died of thirst within days.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search the dead templar find a suit of scale mail (ruined), a warhammer, and a pouch containing five assorted gemstones (10 gp each).

#### 6. House of the Man and Crocodile
This shrine was built centuries ago by Chultans. Carved into a stony hillside, its entrance lies between the feet of an 80-foot-high stone statue depicting a man carrying a crocodile on his back. Any Chultan can identify this as a figure from local mythology and can recall the story for the characters. If characters ask a Chultan what the statue signifies, read:

>>In the early days of the world, Man stood by the banks of a river, frightened. Crocodile raised his head from the water and asked, "What troubles you, cousin Man?"
>>
>>Man said, "I must cross this river, but I fear to enter the water alone, because it teems with your brethren."
>>
>>Crocodile replied, "It's true, you would not be safe. But I will carry you across the river safely on my back, if you promise to return the favor." Man agreed, and Crocodile bore him safely across the water
>>
>>When they reached the far bank, Man asked, "How can I repay you?" Crocodile replied, "I wish to see the realm of Humans, but I fear to go there alone, because it teems with your brethren. You must carry me on your back across your realm." Man had been tricked, but a promise is a promise, so he carried Crocodile safely on his back across the entire realm of humans, a journey that lasted many years. He also swore, in his anger, that never again would Men and Crocodiles be friends, and so it has remained to this day.
>>

This tale is a hint that can get characters safely past the traps in the shrine.

***Man and Crocodile.*** None of the traps in the shrine will be triggered by two characters who are imitating Man and Crocodile, with one riding on the other's shoulders. Those characters can still be injured by a trap that's triggered by someone else; they just won't trigger it themselves. Navigating the shrine is difficult, however, for a two-person piggyback team. There's a recurring danger that they'll lose their balance or the rider will fall off. Any moment when they're not carrying or riding one another, they risk setting off traps like anyone else. If the rider is at least one size category smaller than the carrier, the carrier makes requisite Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws with advantage.

***Ledges.*** In a few places, the floor of the shrine rises 7 feet, forming a ledge. No check is needed to climb a ledge solo, but the ledge's height makes it difficult to see what lies ahead. A rider/carrier team probably is tall enough to see over a ledge, but to climb it, the carrier must make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check; the rider can aid this check. If the check fails by 5 or more, both of them sprawl to the lower floor and, for 1 round at least, they're just two individuals, not a rider and a carrier. If the check fails by less than 5, they tumble forward onto the upper terrace, sprawl apart, and probably set off whatever trap is on that level.

***Spotting Traps.*** Unless indicated otherwise, a trap can be spotted with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. It's best if just one character makes this check, and only the first check counts, no matter how many times the search is attempted. If players insist on having everyone crowd in and search for traps, goblins might steal the party's canoes or rig traps of their own.

#### 6A. Concealed Pit Trap
The ceiling here is 23 feet high and draped with cobwebs, and the stone-tiled floor is covered with a thick layer of mud, creepers, and blown-in leaves, so attempts to spot this pit trap are made with disadvantage. An individual who crosses this section of floor has a 50 percent chance of triggering the trapdoor and dropping into the 20-foot-deep pit, taking damage from the fall as normal.

Once the pit opens, a narrow ledge remains around the outside edge. The ledge can be traversed safely with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, but a character with someone riding on his or her shoulders makes the check with disadvantage.

#### 6B. Blade Trap
The ceiling here is 23 feet high and draped with cobwebs. Each individual that passes through this section of the corridor has a 50 percent chance of triggering scything blades that sweep out from concealed wall niches. Any creature in the 10-foot-square section of hall between the blades must make a DC 13 Dexterity throw, taking 18 (4d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once identified, the trap can be jammed by hammering spikes or metal blades into the niches and succeeding on four separate DC 10 Strength checks (to hammer in the metal solidly enough). Each successful check jams one scythe and reduces the trap's damage by 1d8.

#### 6C. Puzzle Floor
To reach this section of hall, characters must climb a 7-foot-high ledge (see "Ledges" above). The area north of the ledge forms a 16-foot-high terrace, the floor of which is tiled in a four-by-four pattern of squares. There's just enough room for a person to stand at the top of the ledge without stepping on the tiles, but beyond that, the pattern covers the floor from wall to wall, clear back to another 7-foot-high ledge that separates this section of hall from area 6D. The wooden door at area 6D has a similar four-by-four pattern carved into it. A character atop someone else's shoulders can see the entire pattern, but a person of normal height can't see the bottom row of the pattern on the door—and that's unfortunate, because one square of that bottom row on the door glows faintly (roll a d4 to determine which square it is). Even if someone can see that area of the door, the glow is so faint that a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed to notice it.

The pattern on the door corresponds to the pattern on the floor, with the bottom door row matching to the floor row closest to the characters. If an individual applies more than a few pounds of pressure to any square except the one corresponding to the lit-up square on the door, magical flames blast out from the walls. Every creature on the terrace when the flames appear must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the correct tile is stepped on or depressed, no flames are triggered and a square in the second row on the door lights up—again very faintly. As characters advance across the floor tiles, the ledge blocks more and more of the pattern on the door, always making it hard for characters to see which square is lit unless they are riding on the shoulders of a companion.

The tiled pattern on the floor can be crossed safely by stepping only on the squares that light up on the door, or by a two-person rider/carrier team. Putting pressure on any other square triggers the flames. This trigger and trap are magical, so they can't be disarmed or jammed mechanically. Casting *dispel magic* on the floor tiles disables the trap for 1 hour.

#### 6D. Puzzle Door
To reach this door, characters must climb another 7-foot-high ledge, above which the ceiling is 9 feet high. A wooden door at the back of the ledge has no apparent handle or latch. To open it, the four lit-up squares must be touched, in order from bottom to top, by a rider/carrier team emulating Man and Crocodile. The bottom two squares must be touched by the carrier and the top two by the rider. If the squares are pressed correctly, the door swings open into area 6E. If wrong squares are pressed, the squares are pressed in the wrong order, or they're pressed by the wrong people, a *glyph of warding* on the door triggers a *thunderwave* spell. Finding the glyph requires a thorough search of the door and a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Every creature on the ledge when the spell triggers must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage, is pushed 10 feet away from the door, and falls into area 6C, setting off the trap there. A creature that succeeds on the save takes half damage and is not pushed.

#### 6E. Treasury

>>The floor of this dusty, 40-foot-high, 20-foot-wide chamber is littered with dinosaur bones. Webs stretch from the walls to a 30-foot-tall central pillar, coiled around which is a narrow stone staircase, its steps covered with dust. Carved into the pillar are reliefs of a man carrying a crocodile. The reliefs follow the stairs to the top of the pillar, on which sits a large, beautiful, ceramic jug.
>>

The staircase that spirals around the pillar is 2 feet wide, and each step is 1 foot higher than the one below it. Whenever a character who is carrying another character starts his or her turn on the staircase, both the rider and the carrier must make a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If both checks fail, the rider and carrier fall. Otherwise, the team maintains its balance.

***Trapped Steps.*** There are thirty steps in total. Each of steps 3, 10, 17, and 23 has a *glyph of warding* spell placed on it, set to trigger when the step is walked on. Creatures emulating Man and Crocodile don't trigger the glyphs. Each triggered glyph releases a 20-foot-radius sphere of lightning centered on the step. Every creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures emulating Man and Crocodile have disadvantage on the saving throw. To spot a glyph, the dust on the step must be cleared away, and a character searching the step must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***Treasure.*** The jug is an *alchemy jug*, placed here ages ago by Chultans who revered it as a gift from Ubtao. The only safe way to pick up the *alchemy jug* is to emulate Man and Crocodile. Either member of a rider/carrier team can pick up the jug safely and carry it out of the room. If the jug is picked up by anyone else, loose bricks begin to fall from the ceiling. Every creature in area 6E is struck by falling bricks and must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that starts its turn in the room repeats the saving throw. After 3 rounds, the bricks stop falling.

A rider/carrier team trying to descend the stairs while carrying the *alchemy jug* makes Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks with disadvantage unless the jug is placed in a backpack, or slung in a sack or some other hands-free carrier.

### Camp Vengeance

>>Through the foliage, you see a crude timber fortification—a walled compound with watchtowers and tents inside it, encircled by a ditch bristling with sharpened stakes. A large gatehouse faces the river, on the shore of which are four rowboats tied to a wooden post.
>>
>>Scattered around the fort are piles of charred human corpses and flayed animal carcasses swarming with flies.
>>

The corpses around the fort (map 2.4) are the remains of beasts and undead that attacked the camp. The camp dwellers took meat off the dead dinosaurs and other beasts to feed themselves, leaving the rest to rot.

A handful of warriors of the Order of the Gauntlet escaped the undead onslaught against Camp Righteous by retreating up the River Soshenstar toward the Aldani Basin. Three days later, they ended their retreat by digging in on this spot. Eventually they got word of their situation back to Port Nyanzaru, and they've since been reinforced. Their original, small camp has been transformed into a fortified base far more capable of withstanding attack than Camp Righteous ever was.

That's not to say the camp is a hale and healthy place. Unwholesome vapors and clouds of insects descend on it from the pestilential Aldani Basin lying only a few miles to the south. The knights stationed here are disease-ridden and exhausted from their constant battles against giant jungle carnivores by day and undead horrors by night.

The templar in charge is a devout worshiper of Tyr named **Niles Breakbone** (LG male Chondathan human **noble**), a man who's dedicated to everything the Order of the Gauntlet represents but poorly suited to commanding a post like Camp Vengeance. Aside from Commander Breakbone, the standard garrison at the base consists of fifty-eight people, though the actual number of effective warriors at any given time is usually lower due to sickness. Breakbone has two captains under his command: Ord Firebeard (LG male gold dwarf **veteran**) and Perne Salhana (LG female Tethyrian human **veteran**). Reporting to them is a fighting force comprised of eight **veterans** and twenty-four **guards**. This is supplemented by a religious corps of six **acolytes** led by Sister Cyas (LG female Chondathan human **priest** of Helm). Technically, the religious templars are part of the fighting force, but in practice, they spend most of their time tending the sick and wounded. Finally, the fort is supported by a ragtag troop of Chultan hunters and scouts consisting of fifteen **tribal warriors** led by Lorsa Bilwatal (CN female Chultan human **scout**) and **Niles Breakbone**'s longtime friend, Wulf Rygor (CG male half-elf **scout**).

![[024-0306a.webp|right|300]]
#### 1. Boats
Although the camp gets much of its food by hunting, it depends entirely on rowboats and canoes coming up the River Soshenstar to bring replacement soldiers, armor, weapons, arrows and bolts, medicine, tents, cots, boots, clothing, and just about everything else. After the disaster at Camp Righteous, Commander Breakbone would like to have enough boats on hand to carry most, if not all, of the garrison to safety in case the camp is overrun. That's seldom the case.

#### 2. Gatehouse
The camp is ringed by a 20-foot-deep ditch lined with sharpened stakes backed by a stout, 12-foot-high log palisade. The depth of the ditch isn't apparent because it's perpetually filled with muddy water. The spikes are too big to be effective against undead but they're dangerous to Large and Huge beasts. The gatehouse is heavy enough to withstand a charging triceratops, and the gates are never opened without an express command from one of the camp's top three officers.

The gatehouse consists of the ground-level entryway, an upper floor that serves as an armory (all of the garrison's spare weapons and armor are stored here because it's one of the few places that remains reliably dry), and a roofless fighting platform surrounded by a palisade that gives three-quarters cover against attacks made from the ground. Two **guards** are stationed atop the gatehouse day and night.

The rampart under the palisade impedes the camp's drainage. The entire compound is riddled with puddles and ankle-deep mud, which make it a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other vermin.

#### 3. Watchtowers
Each watchtower has a defended top level (providing three-quarters cover) that looms above the camp palisade. A lower level consists of a wooden floor raised several feet above the ground and enclosed with a combination of thin wood and canvas to create a reasonably dry living space. Lorsa Bilwatal, Wulf Rygor, and their cadre of Chultan scouts have their quarters in these lower watchtower billets.

Theoretically, each watchtower is staffed by two **guards** day and night, but personnel shortages sometimes reduce that to one guard or force the knights to take turns on watch.

#### 4. Animal Pen
The knights built this pen for swine, but the camp proved too unhealthy for them and they all died. The current livestock consists of four sickly goats.

#### 5. Field Hospital Tents
These tents are filled with sick and dying soldiers of the Order. At any given time, each tent holds 2d6 patients suffering from a range of maladies. The acolytes tending the sick are themselves so ill and exhausted that they can't make effective use of their magic. Any help the characters provide is greatly appreciated, especially if they donate *potions of healing* or other magic. If characters provide substantial medical aid, Sister Cyas becomes their staunch defender against Commander Breakbone's unreasonable demands.

#### 6. Command Tent
Commander Breakbone understands war well enough when it involves battle lines, waving banners, trumpets, and supply trains, but this war of ambush and creeping through the jungle only mystifies and frustrates him. He spends most of his time in his command tent, poring over inaccurate maps and reviewing reports about the camp's supplies. His two immediate subordinates, Ord Firebeard and Perne Salhana, do a commendable job of managing the camp in the absence of effective leadership from Breakbone.

Commander Breakbone has two immediate problems. If characters arrived by boat, he needs them to carry messages and seven sick soldiers downriver to Port Nyanzaru. Each soldiers is suffering from blue mist fever, shivering sickness, or throat leeches (see "Diseases"). If characters arrived on foot, Breakbone insists that they lead a detachment of his soldiers (consisting of four **guards** and four **tribal warriors**) on a two-week patrol back in the direction they came from; their orders are to destroy any undead they encounter. If either request is refused, Breakbone orders the characters arrested and tied hand and foot in separate guard towers, to await trial for insubordination during a military emergency. If they're found guilty, the penalty is to be stripped of all gear, tied to trees in the forest, and left for the carnivores or the undead.

Sufficiently powerful characters might actually win a fight against the entire camp, but even if they do, they'll be marked for death by the Order of the Gauntlet wherever they go in Chult (and potentially elsewhere in the Realms). If characters escorted Undril Silvertusk to the camp and gained her respect (see "Side Quests"), she will intercede on their behalf and persuade Commander Breakbone to let the characters go. Otherwise, they'll need to win over both Ord and Perne with persuasive arguments to avoid Breakbone's judgment. Each of them can be swayed with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, but only if the character making the check has a sound case for leniency.

#### 7. Soldiers' Tents
Each tent is intended to house four people in reasonable comfort. They have log floors to keep the occupants above the mud, and reed-filled cloth mattresses for sleeping on. None of the material, however, is suitable for long-term use in Chult. The canvas is riddled with mildew and fungus, dampness quickly seeps up through the floors, and vermin of every imaginable variety thrives in the mattresses.

#### 8. Latrines
Anywhere but Chult, these latrines would be excellent. Here, daily rain floods the pits and flushes their contents through the camp. As if that's not bad enough, the wooden structures are sinking into the soft ground around the pits, threatening at any moment to collapse utterly. Most soldiers in the camp avoid the latrines and instead relieve themselves in the jungle (if they can volunteer for outside work details) or over the top of the palisade wall. Either option is safer and more sanitary than using the latrines.

### The Cauldron
Lava pouring into the sea from nearby volcanoes causes immense columns of steam to continually erupt from this bay. This steam combined with billowing clouds of ash and black smoke from the volcanoes give the bay its name. No sea life survives in the bay—the poisoned water is perpetually covered by a layer of floating soot—and vegetation along the coast is all dead and coated in ash.

### Dungrunglung
The grungs of Dungrunglung (map 2.5) toil under the tyranny of their despotic king, Groak, who is obsessed with summoning the goddess Nangnang and mating with her. To please their king, the grungs have erected a 60-foot-tall mud shrine, where Groak plans to woo the goddess and where she, in turn, can bless him with generations of god-touched, royal Groaklings.

Although grungs are traditionally scheming, greedy, and generally unpleasant to deal with, the grungs of Dungrunglung are experiencing desperate times. Ghouls and zombies threaten their existence, and grung poison is ineffective against the undead. Consequently, the grungs are strongly incentivized to use outsiders to solve their undead problem instead of making slaves or meals out of them.

King Groak holds absolute sway in Dungrunglung, and his subjects follow his orders without question. However, should the balance of power shift firmly to Krr'ook or Roark (see the "Grungs of Dungrunglung" sidebar), the grungs do not hesitate to tear Groak limb from limb in a cathartic frenzy. At some point during the adventurers' time in Dungrunglung, they will be approached in secrecy by Krr'ook.

At any given time, Dungrunglung is home to grungs representing all castes and colors. There is only one gold grung (Groak) and one red grung (Krr'ook). For grung stat blocks and more information on grung castes, see *appendix D*.

The grungs speak no language other than their own, which complicates any dealings with them. How they treat adventurers depends on how strong they appear:

- If the party appears weak (few in number or needing assistance), 1d6 + 6 **grungs** with green skin (warriors) surround them as soon as they enter the thorn maze, and press them to attend an audience with the king. The grungs attack and subdue characters who resist. If the adventurers accept, they are taken through the maze to the shrine, where they are received by King Groak. He offers sanctuary and talks of the great ritual to summon Nangnang. Once the characters are rested, Groak commands them to help Krr'ook make final preparations.
- If the party looks capable of putting up a good fight, they are greeted by 1d6 + 6 **grungs** with green skin (warriors) once they reach the settlement. The grungs welcome them to Dungrunglung and beg the characters to hear what King Groak has to say. Groak entreats the adventurers to be part of his divine destiny, and to aid Krr'ook in completing the preparations to summon Nangnang. He offers Dungrunglung's hospitality as well as information about Chult in exchange for their help.

Characters who offend King Groak are thrown in the prison pit (area 7). There, they are approached in secret by Krr'ook, who tries to explain her dilemma. If the party agrees to help her, Krr'ook will find a way to free the party members to aid in her task. Prisoners who are deemed "not useful" will either be roasted over a fire or sacrificed to Nangnang during the Great Ritual.

> ##### Grungs of Dungrunglung
>The following grungs have key roles to play in Dungrunglung. For grung statistics, see *appendix D*.
>
>Groak (gold **grung elite warrior** wearing a circlet of blasting) is the lovestruck king who seeks to woo the goddess Nangnang. Charismatic but unstable, Groak can swing from friendly to homicidal in the span of a few seconds. Because of this, his people dare not even whisper a harsh word about him. Groak wants to be seen as a visionary and a romantic, and he loves to hear stories of the outside world. However, he threatens anyone who dares to question his inflated self-image. Groak tolerates adventurers as long as they entertain him, generally agree with everything he says, and are willing to aid him in his quest to realize his divine destiny to become Nangnang's consort.
>
>Krr'ook (red **grung wildling**) is a grung priest who fears the king's madness. She whispers favorable signs and omens in the king's ear to keep in his good graces. Secretly, Krr'ook suspects that the Great Ritual to summon Nangnang will fail. Consequently, she fears for her life. She approaches the adventurers to see if they can help her fool the king on the night of the ritual. If Krr'ook senses anything out of kilter, or if the ritual goes awry, she scapegoats the adventurers and delivers them straight into the king's infantile wrath.
>
>Roark (orange **grung elite warrior**) is a dutiful and dangerous grung warrior, dedicated to his mad king. Roark thinks all this goddess-summoning nonsense is distracting from the real issue at hand: defending Dungrunglung from the undead. Secretly, Roark's loyalty is to the tribe first and Groak second, but Roark is dutifully abiding the king's obsession for now. He is suspicious of adventurers yet open to help in defending his village from the undead.

#### 1. Thorn Maze
Dungrunglung is surrounded by a 20-foot-high maze of magical, twisted vines. The outer wall bristles with thorns that zombies mindlessly skewer themselves on in their attempts to swarm over it.

The maze has one visible entrance to the north and numerous secret entrances elsewhere around the perimeter. A secret entrance is simply a well-hidden doorway that requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot.

The maze's passages are open to the sky and magically change configuration every minute or so, turning passageways into dead ends, and vice versa. Whichever character is leading the way through the maze must make six successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) checks to find the entrance to the settlement (area 2). Each successful or failed check represents 1 minute of searching the maze. Between each check, roll a d20 and consult the Thorn Maze Encounters table to determine what, if anything, the characters encounter. Characters can avoid the maze entirely by flying over it.

##### Thorn Maze Encounters
| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|---|
| 1–9 | No encounter. |
| 10–12 | 1d6 + 6 **grungs** (green-skinned warriors) on patrol. |
| 13 | 1d3 **assassin vines** (see *appendix D*) blending in with the surrounding walls. |
| 14 | 1d4 **ghouls** lost in the maze. |
| 15 | A harmless yahcha beetle (see *appendix C*). |
| 16 | The characters hear a throaty croak that sounds at once both lusty and forlorn. Its source cannot be ascertained. |
| 17 | 1d6 **zombies** lost in the maze. |
| 18–19 | A concealed pit 5 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and lined with poisoned wooden stakes. The lead character spots the pit with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The first character to step on a pit falls in, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and landing on 1d4 stakes, each of which deals 3 (1d6) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) poison damage. |
| 20 | An interior secret door. It requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot. |

#### 2. Main Entrance
If the characters exit the maze at this point, read:

>>Through an opening in the maze wall, you see a small lake surrounded by reed huts, ferns, and lily pads. Rising up from a flat island in the middle of the lake is a 60-foot-tall shrine made of painted mud bricks, shaped in the likeness of a giant frog. Stairs climb from the lake shore to an open doorway carved into the frog's fat belly. Patrolling the shrine's perimeter are several small, frog-like humanoids with bright orange skin and shortbows.
>>

Four green-skinned **grungs** (warriors) emerge from nearby hovels to confront strangers who approach the shrine unescorted. They attack if no one speaks the correct passphrase in Grung ("Roook, roooook, erp"). If a fight breaks out, reinforcements in the form of twelve **grungs** arrive in 2 rounds. The grungs in area 3 begin shooting arrows at the same time.

#### 3. Groak's Isle
Marshy shores surround the shrine, which is 60 feet tall and made of carved mud blocks painted with natural dyes. Patrolling its base are eight **grung elite warriors** with orange skin. They wield daggers and shortbows, and are loyal to Roark first, King Groak second. Strangers who reach the island without a grung escort are attacked.

#### 4. Shrine

>>The interior of the shrine is one large, hollow room. Just inside the entrance is a clear pool of water that ranges in depth from 2 to 5 feet. Phosphorescent fungi illuminate the pool with soft, dreamy hues. Short, frog-like humanoids of different colors are fussing with the fungi and tossing flower petals into the pool.
>>
>>At the back of the shrine is an elevated semicircular basin of water 10 feet high. Wallowing in the basin is a grung with gold skin. On its brow rests a golden circlet. An orange-skinned grung perches nearby, shortbow at the ready.
>>

The shallow pool at the front of the shrine is where Krr'ook (a red-skinned **grung wildling**; see the "Grungs of Dungrunglung" sidebar) and her assistants (six blue-skinned **grungs**) prepare for the Great Ritual by tending the phosphorescent fungi and scenting the water with delicate perfumes. Removing the fungi from the pool is forbidden, by order of King Groak.

The elevated pool at the back of the shrine is fed by an underground spring. King Groak (a gold-skinned **grung elite warrior** with a *circlet of blasting*; see the "Grungs of Dungrunglung" sidebar) issues commands from the pool during the day and sleeps here at night. He rarely has cause to leave the shrine these days. By his side is Roark (orange-skinned **grung elite warrior**; see the "Grungs of Dungrunglung" sidebar).

***Treasure.*** King Groak wears a *circlet of blasting*, which he's not afraid to use against anyone who insults or defies him. Lining the bottom of his pool are 33 gp and a fist-sized chunk of green quartz (50 gp).

#### 5. Grung Hovels
Dotted about the shores of the lake are several squat huts made from swamp moss and reeds plastered together with mud. The huts range from about 15 to 25 feet in diameter, and each has a single, low entrance. Some have small, round windowlike openings, and a few have stout mudchimneys.

Each hut is large enough to accommodate six adult **grungs** plus 2d6 baby grungs (noncombatants). All the occupants of a given hut belong to the same caste, and thus have the same color skin (except the young, which are all dull green-gray).

#### 6. Lake Grunglung
Lake Grunglung is really just a large pond covered with lily pads and duckweed, where slow-moving catfish gulp at the surface for air. The thick, muddy bottom is littered with the bones of the grungs' feasts.

#### 7. Prison Pit
This dug-out pit is 5 feet deep and covered by stout, wooden bars. Prisoners confined here are guarded around the clock by two green-skinned **grungs** (warriors) until they can be cooked and eaten. Any items taken from the prisoners are entrusted to purple-skinned grungs in the nearby hovels (see area 5).

A character in the pit can throw aside the prison bars with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Before the check is made, each guard makes one opportunity attack against the character attempting the check.

> ##### The Great Ritual
>Once the Great Ritual is complete, King Groak expects Nangnang to materialize and speak words of love, praise, and reassurance to him. Fearing that the ritual will fail, Krr'ook has concocted a desperate plan to fool the king but needs the adventurers' help to pull it off.
>
>- **Krr'ook's Plan.** A while ago, Krr'ook found a box of *Nolzur's marvelous pigments*, which she hid from the king. She plans to paint an image of Nangnang of such quality that Groak will be fooled into thinking it's the real goddess. Krr'ook hopes that one of the adventurers will have the skill to illustrate Nangnang convincingly. She's willing to give the magical pigments as a reward to the adventurers if all goes well. As a further reward, Krr'ook offers a *ring of jumping*.
>- **Moment of Truth.** The ritual happens at night. Fires are lit throughout the village, whereupon scores of common grungs enter the lake and watch the shrine. King Groak dons ceremonial garb made from reeds and wild orchids, and awaits his love on the steps of the shrine, wringing his rubbery hands with anticipation.

>To fool Groak, the characters must paint an image of Nangnang on a surface or craft some other representation of her, then use magic (if they can) to give it a semblance of life. *Animate objects*, *major image*, *minor illusion*, and similar spells can help enhance the illusion. Spells such as *color spray* and *prestidigitation* can also be used to dazzle an audience long enough to conceal a fatal flub.
>
>Whoever gives voice to Nangnang must "sell" the illusion with honeyed words, in order to convince King Groak that he has won a special place in Nangnang's heart. Finally, the ritual must end with Nangnang's departure, handled in such a way that King Groak won't suspect he's been fooled or abandoned forever. If Nangnang or her words ring false, King Groak orders the deaths of Krr'ook and anyone believed to have aided her.
>
>- **Making Nangnang.** To fool Groak, the party must succeed at three or more of the following tasks. Have the characters make the requisite ability checks in the following order:

>- Painting or crafting a representation of Nangnang requires a successful DC 12 Intelligence check. Using *Nolzur's marvelous pigments* grants advantage on the check.
>- Animating Nangnang convincingly requires a successful DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check. If multiple characters contribute, have one character make the check with advantage.
>- Convincing Groak that Nangnang's words are genuine requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Performance) check. If the words are delivered in a language King Groak doesn't understand, the check is made with disadvantage. (Groak speaks Grung only.)
>- Selling Nangnang's blessed departure requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check. The check is made with disadvantage if her words are spoken in a language other than Grung.

>- **End Result.** If the characters succeed at three or more checks, King Groak is thoroughly duped and very happy for the foreseeable future. Characters who request his help will receive it, no questions asked. If the party's trickery is discovered, King Groak orders his subjects to attack them. The attacking force consists of sixteen grung elite warriors (including Roark) and forty grungs. Groak retreats to his elevated pool in the shrine and makes his final stand there.

### Firefinger

>>Rising high above the jungle canopy is a 300-foot-tall, naturally formed spire of rock with smoke issuing from a flaming beacon at the top of it. The walls of the spire are sheer and dotted with small caves. Frail-looking ladders hang from narrow ledges at various heights.
>>

The rocky pinnacle called Firefinger (map 2.6) is an ancient Chultan signal tower. Before the Spellplague toppled them, many such towers were used to send messages between cities via colored flames at night or colored smoke during the day. Firefinger is one of the few still standing, if not the only one.

Firefinger has been taken over by a flock of pterafolk that preys on hunters and explorers along the River Tiryki. The tower is a perfect lair for the pterafolk; in clear weather, from its 300-foot-high vantage point, they can spot anything moving on the river less than 10 miles away, and its sheer walls and crumbling ladders make it potentially lethal for anything without wings to attempt the ascent.

If **Azaka Stormfang** (see chapter 1) is with the characters, she insists they attack the spire. She suggests waiting until nightfall or rain, if none of the characters think of it. If characters refuse to attack the pterafolk, Azaka leaves their service in disgust.

The best way to approach Firefinger without being spotted by the pterafolk is to stay under heavy forest canopy and cross open areas only when rain or darkness limits visibility. If these precautions aren't taken, have the party make a DC 12 group Dexterity (Stealth) check. If the group check fails, the pterafolk mount an attack from above. The attack force numbers two **pterafolk** (see *appendix D*) for each party member. If the pterafolk become outnumbered, the survivors flee back to the spire and warn the others (in which case, the characters have lost the element of surprise).

Near the base of the spire, characters find the body of an elf lying in the mud. Most of his limbs are broken, the ribcage is crushed, and broken twigs and torn leaves are stuck in it what's left of his clothes. This unfortunate explorer was captured on the river, flown to Firefinger, stripped of valuables, then tossed off the top of the tower to his death. Not far away, the characters find another body, and a third, and so on as they scan around the base of the tower. This same fate awaits any character captured by the pterafolk.

The rope-and-wood ladders mounted to the spire are ancient and crumbling. Each character who ascends a ladder to the next higher level (from the ground to level 1, from level 1 to level 2, and so on) must make a DC 8 Dexterity (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the character reaches the next level safely without damaging the fragile ladder. If the check fails, a few rungs of the ladder are damaged and the DC increases by 2 for everyone following behind the climber. If the check fails by 5 or more, the ladder is damaged and the climber falls—quite possibly to his or her death, unless precautions were taken (roping characters together, for example).

Pterafolk glide around the spire constantly except when it's raining. They don't pay much attention to the spire itself, since they arrogantly believe they're safe in their stronghold. Characters might take elaborate precautions to avoid being spotted, but they're surprisingly safe as long as they reach the spire unseen. During rain or at night, there's no chance they'll be spotted climbing the tower. During daytime in clear weather, a circling pterafolk spots climbers with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, unless characters have taken other precautions.

Firefinger's caves were formed by erosion and have ceilings that range from 7 to 10 feet high.

![[027-0308.webp|right|300]]

#### Level 1. Abandoned Cave
A ladder clinging to the south face of the spire ends at this level, which is 60 feet above ground.

The pterafolk don't use this cave, the most prominent feature of which is a 10-foot-deep pit. The shortest distance across the pit where characters can use a long jump is 15 feet. Climbing into or out of the pit is easy and requires a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. However, the first character who enters the pit disturbs four **giant wolf spiders** that nest in crevices along the pit walls. Only a character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher is not surprised when the spiders attack.

***Reaching Level 2.*** A rock chimney leads up to level 2. It's a 90-foot climb with plenty of handholds but several tricky, twisty spots; a successful DC 8 Strength (Athletics) check is required to ascend or descend it without the aid of climbing gear or magic.

#### Level 2. Stirge Cave
A ladder clinging to the south face of the spire ends at this level, which is 160 feet above ground.

The pterafolk don't use this cave. However, the chamber in the northeast corner is the lair of nine **stirges**, which cling to the 10-foot-high ceiling. They don't react unless multiple characters enter their lair or someone brings in a torch or other open flame, in which case they attack.

Six months ago, an explorer who was captured by the pterafolk managed to escape and descend this far before falling prey to the stirges. Her desiccated corpse is slumped along the northern wall of the stirges' chamber, and the glint of gold and gems can be seen through tattered clothing and a rotting purse.

***Treasure.*** Characters who brave the stirges and search the dead explorer can recover 15 gp, a gold and carnelian ring (60 gp), and two onyx figurines representing chwingas (50 gp each). See *appendix D* for more information on chwingas.

***Reaching Level 3.*** Clinging to the west face of the spire is a ledge, above which is a ladder leading up to level 3. Whenever a character crosses the ledge, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, a sudden gust of wind threatens to blow the character off the ledge. The character must make a DC 9 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the character falls to the base of the spire unless he or she is secured by ropes.

#### Level 3. Pterafolk Nest
This level is 240 feet above ground. A ladder clinging to the west face of the spire connects this level to the one below.

Pterafolk elders inhabit this area. They've constructed a traditional nest that's better sheltered from wind and rain. The southwest chamber is home to four elder **pterafolk** (13 hit points each; see *appendix D*). They spend most of their time tending their fire (which makes the chamber stiflingly hot and smoky) and carving grisly totems from the bones of their enemies.

When the pterafolk have prisoners, they're confined to the eastern portion of this cave. Currently, there's one prisoner: a male **aarakocra** named Nephyr. He hails from Kir Sabal and was ambushed by pterafolk while on patrol. His wrists, ankles, and beak are bound with rope, and he has no weapons. He knows that at least eight pterafolk live on Firefinger's peak, but he has no idea how many are there now.

If the characters set him free, Nephyr is grateful. Before departing, he urges the characters to visit Kir Sabal and petition **Asharra** to perform the Dance of the Seven Winds. This dance, he says, is part of a magical ritual that grants nonflying creatures the ability to fly. Once back at Kir Sabal, Nephyr spreads word of the characters' heroism. Characters gain advantage on Charisma checks made to influence the aarakocra of Kir Sabal from that point on.

***Reaching Level 4.*** A 50-foot-tall chimney ascends to the pinnacle of Firefinger. The chimney contains plenty of handholds and requires a successful DC 8 Strength (Athletics) check to climb without gear or magic. At this height, any significant noise in the shaft alerts the pterafolk in area 4 to the presence of intruders.

#### Level 4. Pinnacle

>>The spire's pinnacle is flat and roughly 40 feet square. The edges are crumbling away; it wouldn't be safe to stand too close to any of them. Vines and low brush grow in profusion. Bones and scraps of meat from dozens of creatures are scattered everywhere.
>>
>>A crumbling stone tower rises another 30 feet above the northern corner of the platform. A roaring flame floats in the air, hovering above the tower. Tumbled debris from the tower is heaped around its foundation. Three humanoid creatures with needlelike beaks and leathery wings are worrying the last shreds of flesh from well-chewed bones near an open doorway into the base of the tower.
>>

Firefinger's pinnacle is 300 feet above ground. When the sky is clear, characters can see over 20 miles around the tower. More importantly, they can make out the scattered plateaus, the Peaks of Flame and other volcanoes and mountains ringing the southern coast, and the enormous gaps in the jungle canopy that mark the Aldani Basin, Lake Luo, and the Valley of Embers.

Pterafolk never use the chimney between level 3 and level 4 other than to occasionally drop food to a prisoner. The top of the chimney is surrounded by rocks and low bushes, providing enough concealment for three Medium creatures. Hiding from the pterafolk requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check, with advantage at nighttime or when it's raining.

Six **pterafolk** (see *appendix D*) lair atop the tower, including the flock's leader, Nrak, who has 40 hit points. Nrak is a hate-filled creature with a scar that begins at the top of its head and cuts down the right side of its face and chest to below its right wing.

If **Azaka Stormfang** (see chapter 1) is with the group, consider adding more pterafolk to the fight; she swings the balance heavily in favor of the attackers. Additional pterafolk circle high overhead and can join the fray at any time. Pterafolk won't hesitate to shove a character who foolishly stands at the edge of the tower. They can jump from the tower, circle around on the wing, and use their dive attacks to great advantage.

Firefinger's beacon is a magical plume of fire that puts out tremendous heat. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the flame takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. Any creature that enters the flame or starts its turn there takes 35 (10d6) fire damage. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 17) cast on the flame dispels it.

***Treasure.*** Inside the tower are crude nests and four moldy wooden chests. The chests aren't locked. All together, they hold 2,000 cp, 730 sp, four gemstones (50 gp each), and a *spell scroll* of *commune with nature*. One of the chests also contains a cloth-wrapped, wooden mask resembling a stylized tiger's face. This is Azaka's *mask of the beast* (see *appendix C*). If she's with the characters, she claims it immediately.

### Fort Beluarian

>>The flag of Baldur's Gate flies over this wooden stockade. The whole structure sits atop a 10-foot hillock, the sides of which are shaved vertically to make them steep and difficult to climb. The fort's main gate faces west. On the east side of the stockade, a tall keep holds a commanding view of the surrounding wilderness.
>>

Fort Beluarian's elevation and lack of a ditch allows the stockade to drain well even in heavy rain. The fort (map 2.7) is garrisoned by Flaming Fist mercenaries. Immense wealth passes through Fort Beluarian—enough to make the nobles and merchants of Baldur's Gate rich beyond the dreams of avarice.

![[028-0310.webp|right|300]]

Commanding Fort Beluarian is a lawful evil Flaming Fist blaze (major) named **Liara Portyr** (see *appendix D*), who answers directly to Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard of Baldur's Gate. Liara is 47 years old and has held her post for the past three years. To her, a posting in Chult feels like a test of mettle, but to many of her subordinates, it feels like banishment. The garrison consists of a castellan named Gruta Halsdottir (LN female Illuskan human **knight**), three corporals (**veterans**), and fifty-four privates (**guards**). The garrison operates in three eight-hour shifts, with one **corporal** (gauntlet) and eighteen **privates** (fists) on duty during each shift.

Unknown to her boss, Liara is in league with pirates based out of Jahaka Anchorage and earns a tidy profit from their exploits. Liara's spies in Port Nyanzaru furnish her with ship manifests and departure schedules, which she passes to the pirates via a *sending stone*; the pirate captain **Zaroum Al-Saryak** holds the matching stone (see "Jahaka Anchorage"). Because of their arrangement, the pirates agreed to Portyr's demand that they never attack ships flying the flag of Baldur's Gate. Liara receives a cut of the pirate's profits, some of which goes toward paying bonuses to her garrison to keep the soldiers happy.

Although she's a villain of sorts, **Liara Portyr** has no reason to be an enemy to the characters. She spends most of her time managing the security of her stronghold, going over field reports, and sifting through reports from her spies in Port Nyanzaru. She admires adventurers, and as long as the characters do nothing to antagonize her, she can provide them with useful advice and material aid against the myriad threats lurking in the jungle.

Liara is puzzled by reports coming from her patrols to the south. They've crossed the trails of large creatures in the jungle that don't match anything known to live in Chult. If the characters are planning to explore the region between the east coast and the River Tiryki, or they've already been there and seen anything unusual, she'd be grateful for any light they can shed on the mystery. (Her patrols are seeing signs of the frost giants searching for **Artus Cimber**.)

Given that Baldur's Gate is a member of the Lords' Alliance, it should surprise no one that a handful of alliance operatives are sprinkled through the garrison. The Emerald Enclave has expert guides stationed here as well. One of them, a druid named **Qawasha** (see "*Finding a Guide*"), comes highly recommended.

The main reason adventurers have for visiting Fort Beluarian is to buy a "charter of exploration." Baldur's Gate lays claim to everything east of the Mistcliff and north of Kitcher's Inlet, and now that Mezro is picked clean, it's trying to extend its claim south to Refuge Bay. No one (including the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru) has the force in Chult to dispute this claim. So within its territory, the Flaming Fist does as it pleases, including demanding that explorers buy charters. A charter grants permission to the holder to explore Chult and plunder its riches, but half of an expedition's proceeds and discoveries must be turned over to the Flaming Fist. The charter costs 50 gp, which is treated as a down payment on the split of profits. In addition, those who buy a charter can hire up to six Flaming Fist mercenaries (**guards**) to accompany them for the very reasonable rate of 1 gp per tenday each. It's easy enough to launch an expedition from Port Nyanzaru without a charter. The only risk is that if a Flaming Fist patrol runs into an expedition without a charter, it will attack the expedition and confiscate its gear.

Everything being shipped in or out of the fort goes through Beluarian Landing, which is nothing more than a stretch of beach with a few log buildings above the tide line. Ships anchor a half-mile offshore, and people and supplies are ferried back and forth on rowboats. Six Flaming Fist **guards** defend this station; their chief duty is rowing the boats back and forth. In case of danger, they can barricade themselves inside the stoutest log building or row out to sea until whatever threatens them loses interest and wanders away.

The trek from Beluarian Landing to the fort is 14 miles along a well-marked trail. This trail is not patrolled.

![[030-0309a.webp|right|300]]
#### 1. West Gate
The main entrance is closed by two massive wooden doors with bars that take eight people to slide aside. Because the area is patrolled and the fort has excellent all-round lines of sight, the gates stand open during the day, except when heavy rain restricts visibility and allows the possibility of a sneak attack. The western gatehouse walls are 20 feet high, and the parapets are patrolled day and night by six **guards**. The walls ringing the rest of the camp are 12 feet high, but they look higher from outside because of the fort's elevation.

#### 2. Ore Gate
Despite its name, this secondary gate on the south wall of the fort has nothing to do with ore. It's a sally port the fort's defenders can use to launch counterattacks against enemies assailing the main gate. It stays solidly closed and barred most of the time.

#### 3. Armorer/Weaponsmith
The iron mines of Chult provide everything the garrison needs to make weapons, armor, and metal tools and implements. Korhie Donadrue (LG male Chondathan human **spy**) is the chief armorer for the fort. Having spent years as an adventurer himself before becoming a smith, he enjoys having adventurers and explorers spend time in his work area, swapping tales and sharing news of the world.

Characters can buy most types of weapons, ammunition, and armor here, at prices 25 percent above those listed in the *Player's Handbook*. Donadrue would charge them less, but the prices are set by the Flaming Fist.

#### 4. Bazaar
A dozen traders live within the fort and manage its bazaar. Soldiers from the fort are only a tiny part of their business. Most of their trade involves selling gear to explorers and supplies to miners. The traders also buy and sell gems, hides, animal parts (feathers, teeth, and so forth), and small animals. Their prices are 50 percent higher than those in the *Player's Handbook*, due to the remoteness of the station.

#### 5. Temple of Helm
Fort dwellers pray to Helm for protection against the dangers of the land. Shilau M'wenye (LN male Chultan human **priest**) is in charge of the temple and accepts donations. His father was a Chultan priest, and his mother was a Shou mercenary posted in Chult. He always tries to see the best in other people without judging them.

#### 6. Stables
Horses aren't native to Chult, and the climate (and its many pests) are hard on the animals. Still, a few Tethyrian members of the Flaming Fist brought their horses to Fort Beluarian with them, and they're now a part of the culture of the fort. The horses seldom leave the immediate vicinity of the fort; they're all but useless in the jungle.

The stable has stalls for a dozen horses. Only seven are stabled there now (two **riding horses** and five unarmored **warhorses**).

The stablemaster is Thaeven the Bald (N male Tethyrian human **commoner** with Animal Handling +4). He takes excellent care of the animals, to the extent that's possible in this climate, while complaining constantly about the impossibility of taking proper care of horses in this climate.

#### 7. Jousting Field
The main reason horses are kept at the fort is for jousting. Tournaments are held once a month, and lesser bouts occur when enough people have time off or when two Flaming Fist members have an issue to settle between them.

Tethyrian soldiers stationed at Fort Beluarian brought their chivalric panoply and pageantry with them, but they've combined it with a jungle aesthetic to create something unique. The usual symbols involving falcons, dragons, suns, and so forth give way in Chult to leopard-skin tabards, dinosaur-themed heraldry, helmets shaped like snarling panthers or swooping pteranodons, and armor bedecked with tyrannosaurus teeth and parrot feathers.

Wealthy merchants from Port Nyanzaru sometimes make the journey to attend the jousting tournaments. They camp around the fort in colorful pavilions and place outrageous bets on the outcomes of matches.

> ##### Agents of the Flaming Fist
>If the adventurers spend a day in Fort Beluarian, **Liara Portyr** becomes aware of them and dispatches a guard to bring them to the great hall (area 10C). Adventurers who refuse the summons are banished from the fort. Those who agree to meet with Liara are asked to serve the Flaming Fist. For each service they perform, the characters receive a reward. Characters who decline to serve the Flaming Fist are welcome to continue about their business, but anything they wish to buy in Fort Beluarian costs five times the normal price from that point on.
>
>- **Ghoul Hunters.** Portyr asks the characters to help rid the jungle of ghouls. If the characters are up to the task, Portyr gives the party a free charter of exploration. For every severed ghoul head the characters bring her, she'll pay them 20 gp. (She has enough money to cover the reward for up to eleven severed ghoul heads.)
>- **Shilku Reconnaissance.** Portyr asks the characters to set sail for Shilku Bay, conduct a one-week reconnaissance of the destroyed village of Shilku, and return to Fort Beluarian to report what they've seen. If the characters accept the mission, Portyr pays for their food and passage and gives the party a free charter of exploration. If they complete the mission, the characters are given free meals and guest rooms (see area 10J) whenever they visit Fort Beluarian, and each character receives one potion or scroll chosen from the ones available in the stores (see area 10G).
>- **Strangers in a Strange Land.** Flaming Fist scouts have spotted giant footprints south of Fort Beluarian. If the characters find out who or what is making the tracks, and discover where they're coming from and what threat (if any) they pose to Fort Beluarian, Portyr will reward them with five magic arrows (see area 10G). If the characters accept the mission, Portyr gives the party a free charter of exploration. To complete the mission, the characters must locate at least one group of frost giants as well as their longship (see "Hvalspyd"). To complicate matters, Portyr doesn't believe any report that claims frost giants have landed in Chult and won't pay up unless the characters back up their claims with compelling evidence (such as a frost giant's severed head or a giant-sized weapon).

#### 8. Flaming Fist Provisioner
The fort provisioner, or sutler, is a store that serves the soldiers of the Flaming Fist exclusively. It doesn't have much variety and the prices aren't great, but some elements of the garrison appreciate its "no civilians allowed" policy. It sells basic necessities during the day and serves food and drink in the evening. The store is run by a sharp-tongued old man named Jaro (NG male Chultan human **commoner**).

#### 9. Flaming Fist Barracks
The barracks are the sleeping, eating, and general getting-out-of-the-rain space for the fort's enlisted garrison.

On particularly stifling nights, many soldiers abandon the barracks and sling hammocks in the guard towers. The breeze atop the walls provides some cooling and relief from insects.

#### 10. Inner Bailey
This bastion is a fort within a fort. The bailey is 20 feet tall at the peak of the roof, and the attached palisade is 16 feet high, so the whole structure can be seen from outside Fort Beluarian. The gates are always open unless the fort is under attack or patrols have reported unusual amounts of undead in the neighborhood. In the event that the outer wall is breached and the main enclosure overrun, the garrison would retreat to this redoubt for its final defense.

#### 10A. Courtyard
The bailey's central courtyard is open to the sky. It can be sealed off with heavy gates and stoutly defended by even a handful of soldiers. A boardwalk is installed around the courtyard, so people don't need to walk in the mud when rain pours down.

A wooden statue of an armored man stands in the middle of the courtyard. The statue portrays Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard of Baldur's Gate, leader of the Flaming Fist.

#### 10B. Raptor Pen
Six **hadrosauruses** and four **deinonychuses** (see *appendix D* for both creatures' statistics) are housed in protected stables. The hadrosauruses serve as mounts for small, fast-moving patrols or as pack animals for larger, longer patrols. The deinonychuses are used for hunting—like dogs, only far more vicious. These animals are well respected by the soldiers of the garrison.

The head trainer for the fort's reptiles is Rahl Zuberi (CG male human Chultan **tribal warrior** with Animal Handling +4). His face and arms are covered in tattoos and scars, and he's missing half of his right hand; tooth marks are still clearly visible in the scar tissue. Despite Rahl's ferocious appearance, he's a jovial prankster who spends most of his off-duty time telling wild stories at the provisioner or one of the ale tents in the bazaar, in exchange for free drinks.

#### 10C. Hall
The great hall of the bailey is where most of the fort's military business is conducted, and where **Liara Portyr** (see *appendix D*) meets important visitors. It resembles a hunting lodge, with dinosaur heads and skulls mounted on the walls and the pelts of exotic animals hung like tapestries.

Liara carries a set of keys to the locked storeroom doors (area 10G) and the iron strongbox in her quarters (area 10I). If the characters meet with her, she offers them one or more special quests (see the "Agents of the Flaming Fist" sidebar).

#### 10D. Kitchen
This kitchen serves the camp officers and guests, and prepares special meals during feasts. The enlisted troops are largely responsible for preparing their own food by squads; most of that is handled in the barracks area.

Sigbeorn Dunebar (NG male Illuskan human **veteran**) has logged more years in Chult than any other living member of the Flaming Fist, and he loves it. When he grew too old for fighting and patrolling in the jungle, he volunteered to transfer to the kitchen. Now he's not only the head cook but, more important, is responsible (under the castellan) for ensuring the fort always has an adequate food supply.

#### 10E. Castellan
The castellan of Fort Beluarian is Gruta Halsdottir (LN female Illuskan human **knight**). As castellan, she's second in command to **Liara Portyr**, and she's responsible for every detail of the day-to-day functioning of the fort. If a soldier breaks the rules, Gruta decides on the punishment. If a patrol is overdue from the jungle, it's her duty to find out why. When strangers arrive, Gruta is the one who greets them, finds out why they're here, and decides whether they deserve any of **Liara Portyr**'s time.

This chamber is Gruta's office; her sleeping quarters are upstairs. Her duties take her all over the fort, so she's not often here during the day. She carries one set of keys to the locked storeroom doors (area 10G).

#### 10F. Bell Tower
The bell tower rises another 10 feet above the thatched roof of the bailey, making it 30 feet tall overall. In a normal day, the bell is rung twelve times: it's rung every four hours to signal the change of watch, and it's rung 10 minutes before each of those to signal that a change of watch is about to occur. At the change of the watch, it's rung a number of times equaling the number of the watch: once at the start of the first watch, twice at the start of the second watch, and so forth. On what the garrison calls "the wake-ups," it rings once.

In the event of a camp-wide alarm, the bell is rung continuously for at least a half-minute. The tolling can be heard from 2 miles away by creatures in the open, or 1 mile by creatures in the jungle.

#### 10G. Stores
Reserves of vital supplies are kept under lock and key in these two chambers. The door to each room is locked, and **Liara Portyr** and Gruta Halsdottir carry the only keys. Each door is made heavy wood reinforced with iron bands (AC 17, 20 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage), and its lock can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

The types of supplies stored here include mundane items such as paper and ink, locks, clothing, boots, rope, lanterns, lamp oil, and candles.

***Treasure.*** The second room contains four *potions of healing*, four *spell scrolls* (two each of *lesser restoration* and *purify food and drink*), five *+1 arrows* in a quiver, and a *bowl of commanding water elementals* (to aid in any last-ditch defense of the fort). Portyr and Halsdottir don't blab about these treasures to adventurers, no matter how trustworthy they seem.

#### 10H. Gauntlets' Room
This ready room was intended to house a squad of soldiers assigned to regular guard duty in the bailey, but it's been taken over as quarters by Sigbeorn Dunebar (see area 10D) and three other **veterans** who serve as corporals (gauntlets) in the Flaming Fist garrison.

#### 10I. Command Quarters
**Liara Portyr** sleeps in the southern chamber, while Gruta Halsdottir sleeps in the smaller, southeastern chamber. Both rooms contain books, clothes, and other personal effects.

***Treasure.*** A character who searches under the bed in **Liara Portyr**'s chamber finds a locked iron strongbox. A character using thieves' tools and succeeding on a DC 18 Dexterity check can pop it open. The box contains 220 gp and a *sending stone* that Liara uses to communicate with the pirates of Jahaka Anchorage.

#### 10J. Guest Quarters
Important guests sometimes come to the fort: a merchant prince from Port Nyanzaru, a high-ranking officer of the Flaming Fist, or a noble from Baldur's Gate. Such individuals are housed in one or more of these chambers.

Characters might be given the use of one or more of these rooms if they do something to earn that privilege. Examples include turning over a valuable discovery to the Flaming Fist, leading a counterattack against assaulting undead, or bringing proof that they drove off an incursion by frost giants.

### Heart of Ubtao

>>A massive chunk of earth and rock torn from the earth drifts over the swampy forest, about two hundred feet above the ground. A petrified tree towers above the stone, with its stone roots protruding from the bottom. Between the shape of the rock and the branching of the tree's limbs, it creates the impression of a gigantic stone heart hanging in the sky. The impression is only made more gruesome by the red liquid dripping from the roots.
>>
>>You see a cave mouth in the side of the slowly rotating "heart," and a staircase winding from the cave up to the flattened top where the petrified tree stands. The staircase definitely isn't natural; it was carved with tools into the rock.
>>

The Heart of Ubtao (map 2.8) is an earthmote—a massive chunk of earth held aloft by magic that can't be dispelled. It hovers 200 feet above the ground and rotates slowly counterclockwise, completing one revolution every hour. Chultans call it the Heart of Ubtao because the earthmote is vaguely heart-shaped, and the petrified tree adds the impression of veins and arteries. The dripping red liquid is rainwater that was stained by filtering through iron ore deposits in the rock.

Chultans who've seen the earthmote believe it's actually the petrified heart of the god Ubtao, and they consider it sacred. Priests of Ubtao used to travel here on the backs of flying dinosaurs to seek visions inside the heart and to beseech Ubtao to return. Many Chultans would be incensed to learn that the Heart of Ubtao has become the lair of an undead monster.

![[031-0311.webp|right|300]]

**Valindra Shadowmantle** works for Szass Tam, the most powerful lich among the Red Wizards of Thay, though she is not a Red Wizard herself. She found the heart and converted it into a base to use while her minions search for the Soulmonger. Her orders from Szass Tam are to seize control of the Soulmonger, if possible, or destroy it otherwise. Valindra created a *teleportation circle* inside the heart that she uses to travel instantly to and from Thay (where her phylactery is safely stored), to deliver reports to Szass Tam and pick up new instructions.

Characters who explore the Heart of Ubtao are certain to meet Valindra. She's considered the possibility that adventurers might cross her path, and she won't necessarily be hostile toward them. Her mission is to seize the Soulmonger by any means; if adventurers can help her achieve that, she'll use them.

**Valindra** is an elven **lich**, with these changes:

- Valindra is neutral evil.
- She speaks Abyssal, Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Infernal.
- When preparing her spells, Valindra can swap out any spell on her list of prepared spells for another wizard spell of the same level.
- As a bonus action, Valindra can mask her shriveled flesh and appear to be a living elf. This magical illusion lasts until she ends it as a bonus action or until she uses her Frightening Gaze legendary action. The effect also ends if Valindra drops to 30 hit points or fewer, or if *dispel magic* is cast on her.
- She can't take lair actions in the Heart of Ubtao.

With her ability to appear as a living elf, Valindra can easily conceal her lichdom and her association to Thay. She presents herself as a scholarly wizard who wants to "imprison" the Soulmonger; that way, its unique magic can be studied while it's safely quarantined from the world. She argues that destroying it should be a last resort.

Valindra believes that the Soulmonger is hidden somewhere in the ruins of Omu. She shares this information with the characters even if she suspects they'll betray her down the road, because in the meantime, they might weaken some of Omu's defenses.

If the characters have no way to reach the earthmote when they first encounter it—or at least, no way for everyone to reach it—eventually they spot an elf woman looking down at them from the staircase. After a few moments, she hails them in Elvish, asking their names, why they've come, and so on. If this conversation goes well, she opens an *arcane gate* (cast from a scroll) and invites the player characters to come up. If they have many porters or NPC warriors, she asks that only the "key figures" come up, explaining that her home doesn't have room for their entire expedition. Valindra assures characters that their companions will be safe on the ground.

The lich has no interest in killing the characters as long as there's any chance they could be useful. If a fight breaks out (and there's little reason one should unless the characters start it), Valindra lets her undead servants deal with the adventurers, then slips through her *teleportation circle* back to Thay. The destination sigils aren't recorded anywhere in the heart, so following her is impossible. She'll return in a few days when things have quieted down. How she proceeds from that point is left to your imagination.

![[033-0312a.webp|right|300]]
#### 1. Petrified Tree
A **swarm of bats** inhabits this hollow, petrified tree. The bats emerge each evening to feast and attack any other warm-blooded creature that enters their lair. At the bottom of the tree is a gaping hole that opens in the ceiling of area 4.

#### 2. Staircase
These stairs are smooth and don't show much sign of wear. Only a handful of creatures have walked on them: Valindra, a few of her servants, and the priests of Ubtao who made pilgrimages to the heart. There's no risk of falling off unless a character does something foolish, but the height is dizzying.

#### 3. Cave Entrance
The floor of this entrance slopes up slightly toward the inside of the heart, so water streams out through it continually. The cave mouth appears natural, unlike the steps outside it.

#### 4. Valindra's Lair

>>This cave is musty and dimly lit by daylight filtering down through the hollow, petrified tree trunk 20 feet above. A pool of dirty rainwater occupies the central 20 feet of the floor, between natural pillars formed by the roots of the petrified tree. Three tall bookcases stand against the wall to the right of the cave entrance. A desk and several wooden crates stand against the left-hand wall. Opposite the entrance are two open doorways into smaller chambers and, between them, a large iron cage.
>>

**Valindra's** undead patrols sometimes capture luckless explorers and bring them here. Prisoners are kept in the iron cage while Valindra questions them, then disposed of in the swamp. The cage is not in use when characters arrive, unless you choose to place **Artus Cimber** and **Dragonbait** here as prisoners.

As a lich, Valindra isn't bothered by how dank and uncomfortable the cave is. If that subject comes up, she explains that as an elf, she has no need for a bed or for hours and hours of sleep; she simply meditates for a while at her desk each day. The rest of her time is spent poring over her maps and histories, searching for likely hiding spots for the Soulmonger.

***Treasure.*** The bookcases are filled with books, scrolls, tablets, and maps, all about Chult in one way or another. They cover history, geography, culture, and natural philosophy in great depth, but all of them predate the Spellplague. Valindra would literally kill to possess **Syndra Silvane**'s map, if she learns of its existence. Her spellbooks aren't here—they're safe back in Thay—but the shelves do hold two *spell scrolls* of *arcane gate*.

#### 5. Undead Guardians
Stuffed in this closet are six Chultan **zombies** and two **girallon zombies** (see *appendix D*). They stand here inertly until attacked, or until Valindra calls them out to fight or act as servants.

#### 6. Teleportation Circle
**Valindra's** *teleportation circle* is etched onto the floor of this chamber. Anyone with proficiency in the Arcana skill recognizes what the circle is and can write down or memorize its sigils so it can be used as a destination from another *teleportation circle*. Valindra isn't foolish enough to leave the sigils from her Thayan circle scribbled somewhere in this lair, so no one can follow her if she chooses to escape.

### Hisari
This ruined yuan-ti city stands in the jungle at the foot of the Crown, a fuming volcano that marks the western end of the Sky Lizard Mountains. A powerful ward similar to that of an *antipathy/sympathy* spell prevents yuan-ti from entering the city. Many of the serpent folk who once dwelled here have since relocated to Omu.

The earth swallowed half of the city, which rests in a sprawling underground cavern that has never been warmed by the sun. The rest of Hisari remains above ground, engulfed by vines and creeping flowers. Every brick and pillar is coated in moss, and a latticework of roots and ash covers the city's cracked, golden domes.

### Hrakhamar
Nearby volcanic eruptions forced the dwarves to abandon Hrakhamar (map 2.9). They always intended to reoccupy and reactivate the forge when it was deemed safe, but that day never came.

Firenewts moved in and put the forge to work crafting armor and weapons for themselves. A small group of albino dwarves lurks in the jungle nearby and keeps watch on the forge, but their numbers are too low to challenge the firenewts.

If characters travel within 10 miles (1 hex) of the forge, four **albino dwarf warriors** (see *appendix D*) spot and approach them. Their spokesperson is blunt-talking Sithi Vinecutter. She lays out the problem ("firenewts have taken over our ancestral forge") and proposes the solution ("kill them"). As a reward, each character will be allowed to take twenty 1-pound ingots of refined adamantine from the forge, and the dwarves will lead them to the location of a crashed "flying boat" from some far-off land (see "Wreck of the Star Goddess").

The dwarves offer to stand guard outside while the characters rid Hrakhamar of firenewts. If the characters seem underpowered or in need of a guide, Sithi offers to accompany them. She remembers the layout of the forge but doesn't know how many firenewts are inside, or where they might be hiding.

When the forge was operated by the dwarves, it was linked by trade roads to Shilku Bay and other points on the peninsula. Although those roads have endured a century of neglect, in the vicinity of the forge they were of dwarven construction, and not even a century of disrepair can erase a dwarven road. The roads are buried under ash in the Valley of Lost Honor, but where the mountains rise above the ash plain, the road can be spotted easily and followed to the forge entrance. A character who makes a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check while examining the road sees scorch marks indicative of firenewts or other flame creatures using it.

When the characters reach Hrakhamar, read:

>>The entrance is a 10-foot-tall arched doorway beneath a massive relief carving of a crossed hammer and tongs. Two iron doors were fitted to the entrance, but one lies on the ground, completely rusted off its hinges, and the other sags so badly it appears as if it could collapse at any moment. Several buildings once stood outside the forge, but they've been reduced to their foundations.
>>

The entrance gradually narrows to just 5 feet wide by 10 feet high. The tunnel proceeds this way, sloping downward very slightly but with occasional staircases leading down, for three-quarters of a mile before reaching the forge proper. Scorch marks cover the walls and floor.

![[035-0313a.webp|right|300]]
#### 1. Magma Rift
The dwarves exploited a volcanic rift in the heart of Hrakhamar to smelt iron and adamantine, which they lowered into the magma in clay crucibles.

>>A cavern of molten magma bubbles and flames before you. The cavern walls are lined with metal gantries and cranes that support immense crucibles of scorched clay. Huge chains stretch across the cavern, apparently to shuttle multi-ton buckets of ore across the lava. The heat takes your breath away, brings water to your eyes, and bakes your skin. From where you stand, the only obvious way across is via a narrow stone trestle built for rail carts. The sound of rhythmic hammering comes from somewhere beyond the magma rift.
>>

The magma is 10 feet below the level of the gantries and the rail cart trestles. Great chains span the rift in two places, allowing ore to be hoisted across in buckets.

There's no danger of falling if characters cross the magma on one of the two rail cart trestles. A successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to cross hand-over-hand along one of the chain conveyors. On a failed check, the character falls into the magma. A creature that falls in the magma or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) fire damage.

#### 2. Smelter

>>The hammering sound grows louder, but it's not coming from the chamber ahead. This enormous, rectangular chamber is a working smelter. A rectangular pit in the center of the room is filled with molten iron. Six devices of dwarven design and make, arranged around the pit, siphon off the liquid metal and draw out the impurities. A smaller pool in the southeast corner holds what appears to be molten silver.
>>
>>Creatures that look like a mix of humanoid amphibians and elemental fire are tending to the machines. So far, they haven't noticed you.
>>

The hammering sound comes from the east.

Eight **firenewt warriors** (see *appendix D*) work here. They're involved in their tasks and not expecting intruders, and the chamber is noisy, so the firenewts are surprised unless characters move around openly or otherwise draw attention to themselves.

The central pit contains molten iron. The smaller pool contains molten adamantine, not silver. A creature that falls into either pit or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) fire damage.

The crane to the south (overhanging area 1) is used to lower a crucible of ore into the magma river until the ore is liquid. Liquified ore is rolled along the tracks into area 2, where it's dumped into the appropriate cauldron.

#### 3. Armory
The dwarves' enemies coveted the riches of Hrakhamar. To defend their trove, the dwarves stockpiled weapons and armor in this chamber. The firenewts haven't bothered most of it; they prefer their own weapons over heavier dwarven designs, and the dwarves' armor doesn't fit them.

This chamber includes six each of battleaxes, greataxes, mauls, morningstars, war picks, warhammers, and heavy crossbows, plus two hundred crossbow bolts and four suits of dwarven half-plate armor. If characters are led here by Sithi Vinecutter, she's willing to let the characters take one weapon apiece.

#### 4. Forge
Molten iron and adamantine from area 2 is hoisted into the northernmost of these two chambers, where it's cast into ingots. Some of the metal was worked into tools and replacement parts on the anvils in the room, but most of the iron was moved to the treasury (area 6). Adamantine ingots were sent to the southern portion of the forge, where the massive stamping hammer in the center of the room pounded out impurities. The pounding sound heard throughout the forge comes from this machine-driven hammer.

When characters arrive, four **firenewt warriors** are in the northern chamber, and six **firenewt warriors** are working in the southern chamber under the supervision of a **firenewt warlock of Imix**. See *appendix D* for the firenewts' statistics.

***Iron Lever.*** The hallway between areas 4 and 6 is featureless except for a heavy iron lever set into the north wall 20 feet from the door to area 4. The lever is in the down position and can be lifted easily. Doing so extends the walkway across the magma to area 6, if the trap there caused it to retract. Moving the lever while the gantry is extended causes gears to grind for a few moments deep in the rock, but nothing else.

#### 5. Stores
In these chambers, the dwarves stored supplies of every kind, from food to leather aprons to protective goggles to parchment and ink. The firenewts looted all of it. Now the chief features of these rooms are "nests" of ancient dwarven clothing, insulated gloves, and other padded material that the firenewts sleep on in shifts. The smell in this area is horrid, like burning hair mixed with burning rubber. A disturbance in any of the chambers awakens and draws in all the firenewts in the storage area.

The northwest room is unoccupied. In the northeast room, three **firenewt warriors** play knucklebones with dwarven knuckles. Four **firenewt warriors** sleep in a heap in the middle of the southwest room. The southeast room contains two **firenewt warlocks of Imix** arguing quietly over whether to denounce the warlock in area 4 for heresy against Imix. See *appendix D* for the firenewts' statistics.

#### 6. Treasury

>>Two suits of dwarven half plate armor stand on either side of an adamantine-banded iron door. These suits of armor were beautiful once, but now they're scarred by weapons, scorched by fire, and smeared with filth. The door has two locks, one above the other.
>>

The dwarves sealed their treasure vault before leaving Hrakhamar, and it's remained sealed to this day. Despite their best efforts, the firenewts have been unable to force the door or defeat the locks.

***Locked Door.*** The door's upper lock is embedded in an adamantine frame resembling a stylized form of the dwarven rune for "beginnings." The rune can be interpreted correctly by a character who reads Dwarvish. The lower lock was originally embedded in a golden frame in the shape of a stylized dwarven rune for "endings," but the firenewts scraped away the gold and used it to decorate their shrine to Imix (area 7). Scarring on the door hints at what used to be there; it can be interpreted correctly by someone who reads Dwarvish and makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Each lock can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

The lower lock is trapped. The trap can be spotted with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check, but it's impossible to disarm or bypass. The trap is triggered if an attempt to pick the lower lock fails by 5 or more, if the wrong key is used in the lock, or if it's opened by any means before the upper lock. The trap causes the metal gantry between the treasury and the forge (area 4) to retract west, leaving a 40-foot gap across the magma. The bridge can be re-extended only by lifting the lever in the corridor from area 4. The lever is too far away to be manipulated with *mage hand* by anyone on the treasury side of the magma river.

The keys to the treasury were within the firenewts' grasp. However, they failed to recognize the keys for what they were and incorporated them into a statue they built in the shrine of Imix (area 7).

***Side Chamber.*** The solution to opening the door lies in a seemingly empty side chamber near the treasury. Anyone searching this room turns up a curious box tossed into the corner. The box is made of iron and resembles a book, and it opens from both sides, rather like the front and back covers of a book. One side bears the dwarven rune for "beginnings," the other bears the rune for "endings." Opening either side reveals the impression of a key in the iron plate. The original keys for the treasury were stored in this box.

With all the tools of Hrakhamar at their disposal, copies of both keys can be made from these impressions by a character who has proficiency with smith's tools and who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. Sithi Vinecutter has the needed proficiency if none of the characters do. **Musharib** (see "Finding a Guide") also has the necessary skill. After three failed checks, the box's impressions are ruined, and the box can no longer be used to mold new keys.

***Treasure.*** The treasury contains the stockpiled wealth of Hrakhamar. Thousands of iron and adamantine ingots are neatly sorted, stacked, and crated. Each iron ingot is worth 1 gp and weighs 10 pounds. Each adamantine ingot is worth 10 gp and weighs 1 pound. If she is present, Sithi Vinecutter allows the characters to collect their reward, though she watches them closely to be sure no one takes more than twenty ingots.

Resting atop one crate is a gauntlet made of gold and sized for an adult dwarf. The dwarves of Chult call it Moradin's Gauntlet, and it's customarily worn by the overseers of Hrakhamar. It is finely crafted and worth 2,500 gp, though a wealthy dwarf would pay twice that much to acquire it.

#### 7. Imix Shrine
It's unclear what the dwarves used this area for, but the firenewts converted it into a shrine.

>>The reek of sulfur and burning flesh assaults your nostrils as the tunnel opens into a small chamber. At the northern end of the room is a five-foot-tall statue made of iron, copper, gold, and silver, crudely hammered together into a form suggesting something vaguely humanoid but also fiery. Four firenewts worship before it.
>>

The worshipers are two **firenewt warlocks of Imix** and two **firenewt warriors** (see *appendix D* for the firenewts' statistics). They fight to the death.

The statue weighs 150 pounds and represents Imix, the evil, fiery primordial at the center of the firenewts' militarized, theological society. The statue has little artistic merit (firenewts are passable smiths but poor artists). If the gold and silver are separated from the other metals, they're worth 20 gp and 400 sp, respectively. An albino dwarf or a character skilled at smithing could smelt out the valuable metals with the equipment in Hrakhamar in a few hours.

A character who makes a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check while examining (or smelting down) the statue of Imix recognizes an object hammered into its flames as having once been part of a key. It's the only bit of adamantine on the statue, and only the toughness of adamantine prevented it from being hammered out of all recognition. Once the adamantine fragment is picked out, a more careful search turns up a second fragment of gold, so thoroughly hammered that it's barely recognizable. These keys once unlocked the door to the treasury (area 6) and are beyond repair; so little of them remains that not even a *mending* spell can fix them.

#### 8. Smoke-Filled Caverns

>>The size and shape of this area are impossible to determine. Clouds of roiling smoke sting your eyes, and drifting embers burn your throat as you breathe. You can, however, barely make out what looks like a lantern farther back in the smoke.
>>

These linked caverns are the lair of two **smoke mephits**. What the characters perceive as a dim lantern is a *dancing lights* spells cast by one of the mephits to lure the characters deeper into the noxious lair.

All of area 8 is heavily obscured. Characters can move 10 feet per round by following a wall with their hand; moving faster than that means taking 1 bludgeoning damage from banging heads and shins into stone protrusions. After 2 rounds in the smoke, each character must make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of his or her turns or gain a level of exhaustion. Those who hold their breath won't gain exhaustion for as long as their breath holds out; characters who tie wet rags across their nose and mouth or take similar precautions have advantage on the saving throw for 10 rounds, but then the rag dries out in Hrakhamar's intense heat.

The mephits aren't interested in attacking adventurers directly, but they'll gleefully loot the bodies of anyone who collapses in the smoke. If cornered, they beg for mercy. They offer to trade information for their lives if a character makes a successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check. They know the forge is infested with firenewts, where the newts' giant strider mounts are kept, and that two dwarf prisoners are tied up in the cells due west of the mephits' lair.

#### 9. Cells and Passage to Wyrmheart Mine
Firenewts are notorious torturers and eaters of humanoid flesh. Prisoners are tied up, gagged, and tossed here until the firenewts decide how to inflict the most intense and longest-lasting pain on them. Most prisoners are dead within a tenday, but they wish for the end much sooner.

Dwarves are the exception. There's much about the workings of Hrakhamar the firenewts still don't understand. Captured dwarves are tortured for hints about how the foundry's tools and machines work. Two luckless **albino dwarf warriors** (see *appendix D*) are tied, gagged, and blindfolded here when characters arrive. Their names are Laz Drumthunder and Malkar Stonegrist. Both are wounded and have 1 hit point remaining. They are also starving, dehydrated, and suffering from 5 levels of exhaustion. Laz will recover normally with time and care, or magical healing. Malkar has gone mad; he shudders uncontrollably and screams nonstop if his gag is removed. A *lesser restoration* spell or comparable magic is needed to restore his sanity. If Laz and Malkar are taken to Sithi Vinecutter, she and her companions look after them.

The tunnel winds southward 40 miles to Wyrmheart Mine, which has been taken over by the dragon Tzindelor and her kobold minions (see "Wyrmheart Mine"). The tunnel is passable and the rail cart tracks are intact for the full length, but encounters with **carrion crawlers** and **giant spiders** are guaranteed. As characters get closer to Wyrmheart Mine, they might also encounter bands of **kobolds**. The albino dwarves know where the tunnel leads but are quick to warn characters about the red dragon that has taken over Wyrmheart Mine.

#### 10. Mine Cart Bay
The dwarves parked their ore carts and flatbed rail carts here when they weren't in use. Two of each are still here, and both are in minimal working condition.

The firenewts use the area as stables for twelve **giant striders** (see *appendix D*). The giant striders are tethered, but the tethers are meant only to keep them from crossing the westernmost line of cart tracks and wandering through the tunnels. An angry or alarmed strider can easily break loose, and these vicious creatures become both angry and alarmed when they see humanoids who aren't their firenewt masters.

As soon as a non-firenewt enters area 10, the giant striders begin stamping, growling, and straining at their tethers. Beginning on the following round, 1d3 giant striders break loose each round and attack or join in an ongoing battle. They don't attack firenewts, and a firenewt can hop onto a giant strider and ride it as a mount using the standard rules for mounted combat.

### Hvalspyd
The *Hvalspyd* (the name means "whale spear") is a longship sized for frost giants: 250 feet long, with sails made from white dragon wings. It's anchored 100 yards off a beach along Chult's northeast coast, 70 miles north of Kitcher's Inlet. It's impossible for the giants to hide the vessel; anyone sailing down the coast can't miss it.

The *Hvalspyd* sailed south from the Sea of Moving Ice with a crew of twenty frost giants. Three **frost giants** remain aboard the ship—two stand guard while the third rests. Two more **frost giants** watch the sea from the beach. The other fifteen giants have split into five search parties of three giants each, and are searching the jungle for **Artus Cimber** and the *Ring of Winter*. One of the frost giant hunters is the *Hvalspyd*'s captain, **Drufi** (NE female **frost giant**).

At the behest of her lord, Jarl Storvald, **Drufi** led this expedition to retrieve the ring. Storvald wants it for reasons explained in the adventure *Storm King's Thunder*. He believes that with the *Ring of Winter*, he can freeze the world and bring about the Age of Everlasting Ice—a wonderful dream that keeps **Drufi** focused on the task at hand. The giants know nothing of **Acererak**, the Soulmonger, or the death curse.

The frost giants are out of their element in tropical jungle. They regard it as the worst kind of hell imaginable. They have no intention, however, of failing their jarl and letting the *Ring of Winter* slip through their grasp.

#### Frost Giant Search Parties
**Drufi**'s search party includes two male **frost giants** and a pair of **winter wolves**. Each of the other four search parties consists of three **frost giants** and 1d2 **winter wolves**. The frost giants can't move through the jungle without leaving a trail. If characters encounter giants, they're likely to see evidence hours or days before the actual meeting: trampled brush, broken or uprooted trees, gigantic boot prints, 3-foot-high runic trail markings carved into trees or etched onto boulders, and winter wolf droppings. Chult has many gigantic carnivores, so a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check is needed to identify these indicators as foreign to the jungle; if the check succeeds by 5 or more, the source is recognized as frost giants. A Chultan guide has advantage on this check but won't make the leap to frost giants. That idea is just too far-fetched.

So far, the giants' searching has roamed from the coast to the River Tiryki, and from the ruins of Port Castigliar to the northeastern mountains. **Drufi** has seen Fort Beluarian from a distance and Port Nyanzaru from across the mouth of the River Tiryki, but the giants avoid Flaming Fist patrols. For their part, the mercenaries and scouts from the fort have seen many puzzling signs in the jungle to the south, but they haven't yet concluded they're dealing with frost giants. The giants' next step will be to push farther south. At some point (determined by you), they'll return to the *Hvalspyd*, sail south to Refuge Bay, and start the search afresh from there. Obviously, this is a very inefficient way to search an area as large and as dense as Chult, but **Drufi** has no better idea.

**Drufi** has no reason to attack or kill the characters, should they meet, unless the characters attack her or if she suspects they know more than they're admitting about the *Ring of Winter*. Before taking any action, she'll try to ferret out what, if anything, the characters know about **Artus Cimber** and the artifact. **Drufi**'s attempts to be cagey about her interest have all the subtlety of a charging mammoth. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check quickly recognizes that **Drufi**'s clumsy questions are about a powerful magic item in Cimber's possession.

Any meeting between the characters and the giants will be more dramatic if it occurs after the characters' first encounter with **Artus Cimber**. If they admit they've met him but can't (or won't) tell **Drufi** where he is, she has all the reason she needs to capture the characters and torture the information out of them.

#### Treasure
The *Hvalspyd*'s stores have been mostly depleted, and the frost giants didn't bring treasure with them on the expedition.

### Ishau
The coastal settlement of Ishau sank into the sea. Now, the village's stone buildings sit completely underwater in Refuge Bay, a few miles from shore. Hunter sharks and reef sharks glide among the sunken ruins, competing with plesiosaurs for the position as top predator—but all of them fear and avoid the vicious sea hags who occasionally scour the ruins for human remains and waterlogged trinkets.

### Jahaka Anchorage
Three pirate ships use Jahaka Anchorage (map 2.10) as a haven: the *Dragonfang*, the *Emerald Eye*, and the *Stirge*. All three are sailing ships (see chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). See the "*Pirates of Jahaka Anchorage*" sidebar for information on the captain and crew of each vessel.

Only one pirate ship is docked at the anchorage at any given time. A second ship rides at anchor outside the harbor up to a mile away, ready to defend the anchorage. The third ship is always at sea, usually prowling for victims. You can randomly determine which ships are where. The captain of whichever ship is docked commands the anchorage from aboard his ship.

The anchorage is sheltered inside a sea cave. It's damp and echoing, but at least the cave keeps out the daily rain. The pirates outfitted it with a pier and a ramshackle fort built from scavenged planking, old barrels, deck grates, spars, and whatever else they could scrounge. It incorporates a warehouse where they stash their stolen booty until it can be sold (area 4), a cell where captives are held until they're ransomed or sold (area 5), and a tavern where the pirates carouse (areas 6A–6C).

The three pirate captains are in league with **Liara Portyr** of Fort Beluarian, who gives them information about vessels sailing into and out of Port Nyanzaru and helps the pirates sell their stolen cargoes. Ships flying the ensign of Baldur's Gate are usually left alone, as a condition of Portyr's cooperation. The Flaming Fist commander is kept apprised of upcoming naval patrols originating from nations on the mainland, and she passes this information to the pirates via a *sending stone*.

![[036-0314.webp|right|300]]

Even more than their deal with **Liara Portyr**, the pirates' most important asset is this hidden base, and every pirate must swear a blood oath to protect its secret location. Any ship that sails within visual distance of the anchorage is attacked and chased, if necessary. The *Brazen Pegasus* (see "*Harbor Ward*") has a good chance to escape because she's so fast; other ships are unlikely to get away.

Anyone who wanders into the anchorage from the jungle or from the bay is unlikely to be allowed to leave. If characters stumble into Jahaka Anchorage, the pirates claim it's a trading post or an exploratory base established by the Flaming Fist or a merchant consortium, and they'll put up a convincing front to that effect. They'll do whatever it takes to get strangers off their guard, then kill or capture them.

The roof of the cave looms 60 feet above the water, on average (this varies a bit with the tide). It's 50 feet above ground level and 20 feet above the top of the watch tower and gantry. Two natural stone columns sit across the mouth of the inlet with only a 25-foot gap between them, so that ships must be carefully towed into the cave by small boats and maneuvered with ropes once they're inside.

Thanks to its sheltered position and the perpetual mist in the bay, the cave is difficult to find unless a person knows where to look. An alert lookout spots the structures and docked ship inside the cave automatically if passing within a half-mile of shore. At a distance up to 2 miles, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed. Lookouts at the anchorage notice a ship within 2 miles automatically.

The pirates' first line of defense is a ring of submerged rocks a quarter-mile from shore. The captain of a ship trying to sail though must make a DC 10 Intelligence check. If the check succeeds, the ship gets past the rocks safely. If it fails by 4 or less, the ship strikes a rock and springs a few leaks but suffers no serious damage and can continue seeking a passage through. If the check fails by 5 or more, a rock causes significant damage; the ship lists badly and its speed is halved until the hull is repaired. Striking a third rock causes the ship to sink. The pirates, of course, know where the rocks are and avoid them.

The watchtower (area 6) and the entire elevated walkway from the tower to the warehouse (area 4) have crenelated parapets for defense. These provide half cover.

Aside from the pirate crews, Jahaka Anchorage is home to a handful of pirates who answer to the tavernkeeper, **Bosco Daggerhand** (area 6A)—and only because he's master of the ale.

> ##### Stirge
>Three pirate ships use Jahaka Anchorage as a base, and their captains have forged tenuous alliances with each other and **Liara Portyr** of Fort Beluarian. Use the deckplans in *appendix C* of the Dungeon Master's Guide to represent each pirate ship, as needed. Each ship's crew is described below.
>
>Captain **Elok Jaharwon** (NE male Chultan human **wereboar**) has no patience or sense of humor. He was first mate of the Dragonfang until a year ago, when he staged a mutiny and hurled the former captain overboard. The other captains are still adjusting to their ill-mannered new confederate, who seems intent on bullying his way toward declaring himself king of the pirates.
>
>Elok wants to stop sending a slice of the pirates' profits to Fort Beluarian, which would end the alliance with **Liara Portyr** and probably be self-defeating; the pirates could keep more of their profit, but they'd take fewer prizes and incur more risk. The other captains see the disadvantages clearly, but Jaharwon is building a following among the rank-and-file pirates of all three crews.
>
>The Dragonfang's crew includes a first mate named Mad Kalita (LE female Chultan human **spy**), fifteen Chultan **bandits**, three Chultan **thugs**, and a "sea witch" named Eye of the Deep (N female Calishite human **druid**).
>
>The calculating Captain **Zaroum Al-Saryak** (LE male Calishite human **bandit captain**) has a special fondness for gemstones. He wears a coat with glittering gems sewn into it (750 gp) and wears a scimitar with gemstones embedded in the hilt (1,250 gp). His ship, the Emerald Eye, has cabins decorated like rooms in a Calishite pasha's palace. Al-Saryak is fond of chopping off the heads of those who displease him and dangling them from his ship's mermaid figurehead. A long-ago injury cost him his left eye and incised a scar in the form of a large X across his face. The ruined eye socket now holds a magical gem that allows Al-Saryak to discern ghostly pathways leading to treasure. The gem works for no one else. Al-Saryak holds the *sending stone* matched to **Liara Portyr**'s (see "Fort Beluarian").
>
>The crew of the Emerald Eye consists of a first mate named Voltan (CE male Calishite human **berserker**), twelve Calishite **bandits**, two Calishite **thugs**, and five Chultan **tribal warriors**.
>
>Captain **Laskilar** (NE male Tethyrian human **bandit captain** wearing a *cape of the mountebank*) is a flamboyant, rakish pirate who's grown tired of chasing merchant ships and hearing their captains whine and plead over lost revenues and spilled blood. He'd rather seek lost treasures and magic items, but not by digging into ruins and tombs; instead, he'll happily pursue adventurers across jungles and oceans to steal whatever hard-earned plunder he believes they have. His ship, the Stirge, is filled with scoundrels and cutthroats eager to do his dirty work. **Laskilar** also stays in contact with a host of wealthy patrons in Port Nyanzaru and more distant ports who are eager to pay a king's ransom for the rarest of his ill-gotten gains.
>
>The crew of the Stirge includes a first mate named Heel (NE male half-orc **gladiator**), twelve Chultan and Tethyrian **bandits**, six Chultan **thugs**, and a mad sea priest named Caldos Hellingskorn (CE male Illuskan **priest** of Umberlee).
>

![[038-0315a.webp|right|300]]
#### 1. Jungle Gate
The narrow strip of land between the cliff and the water is closed off by a 15-foot-high wall made of thick palm logs lashed together with stout vines. Their bottoms are set into the ground, and the whole wall is braced up along the inner side with more palm logs. The wall is meant to keep out undead and dinosaurs. The gates are roughly made but reinforced with iron bands and backed by two heavy wooden bars. The pirates never open these gates without the approval of whichever captain is currently in charge of the anchorage.

#### 2. Pier
Whichever pirate ship is in port is tied up at this pier. Cargo is offloaded using the crane at the warehouse (area 4). The pier is covered in slick moss and perpetually in need of repair.

Two small boats are kept here. One is a simple dinghy used mainly for carrying food and water to prisoners in area 5. The other is a small cutter with six oars and a single mast, used for towing ships into and out of the anchorage. Any sailor recognizes that the rowboat would quickly be swamped by waves if it was taken out of the safe harbor, but the cutter could be rowed and sailed on the open sea in an emergency. It has a top speed of 5 mph under sail or half that when rowed, and it can hold up to ten Medium occupants.

A short pier allows access to Sharkbait Rock. Prisoners with no value or who have information they refuse to give up, or pirates who've seriously broken the buccaneer's code, can be lashed to the rock. There they'll either drown at high tide or be nibbled on by sharks and other predators until their punishment is complete or their tongues are sufficiently loose.

#### 3. Officers' Quarters Ashore
Each of the three captains has one of these chambers for his private use. In practice, the captains seldom use them, preferring the comfort and safety of the cabins aboard their own ships. Instead, the use of these private quarters is meted out as a reward to crew members who distinguished themselves on the latest voyage, and as a result, they tend to be squalid and smelly.

#### 4. Warehouse
All three captains store their booty in this common warehouse. The double door is sealed with an iron padlock to which only the captains have keys. It can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

>>A fortified balustrade overlooks the anchorage to the south. The wooden platform extends over the water on pilings, and a crane on the platform serves to lift cargo up to the warehouse. Thrust into the rough-hewn back wall of the warehouse are scores of rusty blades—old longswords, shortswords, rapiers, scimitars, and daggers.
>>

Among the rusty blades stuck in the walls are ten **flying swords** that pull themselves free and attack when the treasure in the room (see "Treasure" below) is disturbed. The animated blades don't attack any creature wearing an eye patch, nor do they animate when an eye patch-wearing creature disturbs the treasure.

***Treasure.*** The warehouse's treasure is contained in numerous unlocked chests, sacks, sealed crates, and casks. The trove consists of 6,400 cp, 2,500 sp, 300 gp, 60 pp, ten gold bracelets (25 gp each), an electrum goblet (25 gp), and two *spell scrolls* (*knock* and *Leomund's tiny hut*) in corked wooden tubes.

#### 5. The Cage
Prisoners are held in this large but filthy cell until they're ransomed or sold into slavery. High waves sometimes wash into the chamber, soaking everyone and leaving puddles on the floor. Palm logs form the bars across the front of the cage; they're held in place by sturdy pins that must be noisily hammered out before the logs can be lifted out to create a gap wide enough for a Small or Medium creature to slip through. Escape is risky for three reasons. First, pirates on watch atop the tower (area 6) keep an eye on the cage. Second, 1d4 + 1 **reef sharks** inhabit the water below the cage. Third, the only place escapees can go is the jungle, which is more cruel than the pirates.

Whether any prisoners are in the cell when characters arrive at Jahaka Anchorage is up to you, but it's seldom empty. Besides captive sailors and merchants, there could also be Harpers, Zhents, or adventurers. Adventurers imprisoned here could be members of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers, a group from Cormyr that maps uncharted places and hunts for lost artifacts. Characters who have not yet encountered **Artus Cimber** and **Dragonbait** might find them hiding nearby, plotting to free the prisoners. As a former member of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers, Artus would be motivated to help other society members in jeopardy.

#### 6. Watchtower
This ramshackle watchtower stands 30 feet above "dry" land. It's surrounded by a crenelated parapet that provides half cover to defenders. A ballista is also mounted on the tower. It can be used against vessels intruding in the anchorage, but it's primarily for defense against large reptiles threatening the jungle wall (area 1). Two pirates (**bandits**) are always on duty atop the tower, and more come pouring out of Bosco's Bilge (area 6A) if the brass alarm bell is rung. A spiral staircase carved into a nearby pillar of rock allows access to Bosco's Bilge.

#### 6A. Bosco's Bilge
This structure is built from the hull of a captured ship that was too slow to be used as a pirate ship, but it had one fine quality: it didn't leak. The pirates hauled it out of the bay, hacked it apart, and flipped it upside down to form a building of sorts. It's now Bosco's Bilge, an ersatz tavern catering to the off-duty pirate crews relaxing at Jahaka Anchorage. The room contains benches, stools, and a few tables on a sand floor. It reeks of spilled beer, old food, and stale tobacco smoke.

The proprietor is **Bosco Daggerhand** (NE male human **thug** who wears a *ring of animal influence*), so called because he never shakes anyone's hand without his other hand resting threateningly on the dagger in his sash. He keeps a semi-tame **deinonychus** (see *appendix D*) as a guard animal, which he controls with his magic ring. The pirates refer to the raptor as Knuckles—because someone who's foolish enough to let it nip their hand won't have anything else left.

Any time of the day or night, 2d6 pirates (**bandits**) are carousing in Bosco's Bilge. Another 1d6 pirates are passed out on the tables or floor.

#### 6B. Kitchen
Bosco's customers aren't very interested in food, but the simple fare he offers—boiled shark, roasted snake, and other jungle delights—is prepared here. When leftovers become so rancid the pirates won't eat them, they're either fed to the deinonychus or sent to the captives in the cage (area 5). The door to the kitchen is always closed, to keep Knuckles from raiding the pantry.

#### 6C. Bosco's Bunk
Bosco's private room contains a hammock, a locked sea chest stuffed with clothes and trinkets, a few musty books, and a pile of reeds for Knuckles to sleep on. Bosco carries the key to the chest, or the lock can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

***Treasure.*** A false bottom in the sea chest can be found with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. The compartment holds 58 gp, 140 sp, a *potion of water breathing*, and three black eye patches. (The pirate captains don the eye patches before trying to remove treasure from area 4.)

### Jahaka Bay
Pirate ships enter and leave this bay as they come and go from Jahaka Anchorage. The River Tath plunges down multiple waterfalls before spilling into the bay, so mist perpetually drifts out of the river mouth and across the bay. This mist isn't especially heavy but its effect accumulates over distance, so it restricts visibility to a few miles on all but the windiest days. The outline of the coastal mountains can be seen from any distance in the bay, but finer details—something the size of a ship or smaller, for example—can't be discerned from more than 2 or 3 miles distant. Since the bay is about 20 miles wide and 40 miles deep, it's an excellent hiding spot for pirates. Any ship that wanders into the bay without knowing precisely where to look is unlikely to stumble upon Jahaka Anchorage.

### Kir Sabal

>>An ancient monastery overlooks the jungle from its perch on the cliff of a tall plateau. Stone steps and rickety walkways connect the various buildings, the lowest of which is 500 feet above the ground. The main building has a circular mazelike symbol carved into its crumbling facade.
>>
>>Every few minutes, bird folk either land at the monastery or launch themselves from its balconies and take to the sky.
>>

![[039-0316.webp|right|300]]

Kir Sabal (map 2.11) is home to a flock of aarakocra and a peaceful sanctuary where heroes can find rest and safety—if they can reach it. The aarakocra are also sheltering the last human descendants of the royal line of Omu. If the characters eventually liberate Omu from the evil possessing it, the royal line can be restored.

Originally, the monastery structures could be reached by ascending a path that combined natural stone ramps, steps cut into the cliff face, and wooden walkways built onto the cliff. The ramps and steps are still mostly intact, but the wooden walkways are rotting or missing entirely in many places. The aarakocra don't need them and have no reason to repair them.

To reach the monastery from the ground, a character must make three ability checks. Each time a check fails, the character must choose between either taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from a fall or gaining 1 level of exhaustion (which means disadvantage on further ability checks). The three ability checks are as follows:

- A DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb around gaps in the walkway.
- A DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cross wide gaps in the wooden walkways by jumping along oddly spaced support beams.
- A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot rotted planking that won't support weight.

The climb takes 1 hour, plus 10 minutes for every failed ability check. Unless characters make the climb invisibly, at night, or during a rainstorm, it's impossible to reach the monastery without the aarakocra knowing they're coming.

Fifty-six **aarakocra** live in Kir Sabal, in twelve "nests" or extended family groups. About a third of the aarakocra population are juveniles; the rest are adults split evenly between males and females. They live primarily by hunting in the jungle, fishing along the River Olung, and gardening atop the plateau, where they're safe from most of Chult's predators.

The leader of the community is an incredibly old aarakocra named **Asharra**. The others refer to her as Teacher, and they revere her as a living saint. **Asharra** is intelligent, ambitious, and somewhat manipulative, but never cruel or insensitive. **Asharra** is an **aarakocra**, with these changes:

- **Asharra** is lawful neutral.
- She has 31 (7d8) hit points.
- She has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 17, and the following skills: History +4, Insight +5, Perception +7.
- She has the Spellcasting trait described below.
- She speaks Auran and Common.
- She has a challenge rating of 2 (450 XP).

***Spellcasting.*** **Asharra** is a 5th-level spellcaster who uses Wisdom as her spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13; +5 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following druid spells prepared:

>- Cantrips (at will): *druidcraft*, *mending*, *produce flame*
>- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic*, *faerie fire*, *thunderwave*
>- 2nd level (3 slots): *gust of wind*, *hold person*, *lesser restoration*
>- 3rd level (2 slots): *call lightning*, *wind wall*

The aarakocra of Kir Sabal lead ritualistic lives and follow strict rules of behavior laid down by tradition and the Teacher. To a large extent, the rules and rituals have taken on a life of their own irrespective of any religious observance.

If the characters approach peacefully, they'll be welcome in Kir Sabal as long as they don't harm anyone, disrupt traditions, steal, or lie. Even as guests, they're expected to spend a few hours a day helping with chores (sweeping floors and cleaning dishes, mostly).

If the characters tell **Asharra** of their plan to visit Omu and destroy the Soulmonger, she offers to perform a ritual called the Dance of the Seven Winds, bestowing on the characters the magical ability to fly (see the "Dance of the Seven Winds" sidebar). To complete the ritual, she needs a black orchid, which can be found only in Nangalore (described later in this chapter). **Asharra** can provide directions, but she doesn't allow her people to go anywhere near the ruins because of the evil, intelligent cranes (eblis) known to live there.

> ##### Dance of the Seven Winds
>**Asharra** knows a ritual called the Dance of the Seven Winds, which temporarily grants magical flight to as many as ten nonflying creatures. The ritual, which takes 10 minutes to complete, can only be performed by an aarakocra elder and requires a black orchid as a material component.
>
>**Asharra** must grind the orchid to powder, inhale it, and dance in circles around the ritual's beneficiaries uninterrupted while seven other aarakocra chant prayers to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. When the dance concludes, **Asharra**'s wings disappear and she loses the ability to fly. The ritual's beneficiaries each gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet (allowing them to fly 4 miles per hour). This benefit lasts for 3 days, after which **Asharra**'s wings reappear and she regains the ability to fly.
>

Seventeen-year-old **Princess Mwaxanaré** (see *appendix D*) is the oldest living descendant of the royal families of Omu and the primary heir to the fallen kingdom. She and her six-year-old brother **Na** (a noncombatant with AC 10 and 3 hit points) are guests of the aarakocra—although "wards" might be a more accurate description. Their great-grandmother, Napaka, was the last ruling queen of Omu; their father, Omek, died in a fall, and their mother, Razaan, was killed by pterafolk. The aarakocra aim to protect the young royals (and their progeny, if necessary) until the evil in Omu is banished. The aarakocra say that they're doing this solely for the future of Chult, but **Asharra** secretly hopes that the aarakocra will be elevated to key roles in any renewed Chultan kingdom, if and when it comes about.

Mwaxanaré is vain, headstrong, and impatient to claim her throne. She doesn't take kindly to backtalk and is unaccustomed to speaking to anyone except **Asharra** without condescension. In her view, she's already Queen of Chult; the rest of the world is at fault for not acknowledging that.

Unfortunately, the princess's whole life has been sheltered at Kir Sabal, so her understanding of the world beyond the monastery is woefully, almost comically, narrow and distorted. For example, she never refers to other kingdoms as anything but principalities or holdings ("the holding of Waterdeep," "the principality of Amn"); she believes that the other rulers of Faerûn would send thousands of soldiers to her aid in a matter of days if they were aware of her need; and she's certain the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru will welcome her return and gladly hand over rulership of the city to their rightful monarch. The world as she understands it is tiny and hungry for her leadership. Mwaxanaré isn't a fool; for the most part, these are things she's been taught by **Asharra**.

Mwaxanaré believes she can garner widespread support to repopulate and rebuild Omu by retrieving a symbolically significant yet long-lost treasure called the Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare (see chapter 5). If the characters claim to be headed to Omu, she urges them to find the chalice and return it to her "for the good of Chult." If the characters request something more substantial as a reward, she offers them 250 gp worth of choice pieces from her private treasury (see area 5).

Although the aarakocra treat her well, Mwaxanaré is lonely; the only other human in Kir Sabal is her brother. Consequently, the princess is likely to fixate on one of the adventurers as a potential romantic partner. This attachment will be powerful, fiery, and jealous, and Mwaxanaré is accustomed to getting everything she wants.

Against **Asharra**'s wishes, the princess forged a pact with the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, ancient beings of the Outer Planes, to become a fledgling warlock. She detests physical labor and puts her *mage hand* and *unseen servant* spells to constant use. Through her pact, she has also gained telepathy, which she enjoys using.

If **Asharra** suspects that Mwaxanaré might learn disturbing or inconvenient truths about the world from the characters, or that her passion for one of them might lead to tragedy, they become a dangerous presence in **Asharra**'s eyes—and Kir Sabal is a precarious place for creatures without wings.

**Na** wears an aarakocra costume he made himself and pretends to be one of the bird folk. He is uncommonly studious and bookish for a six-year-old boy. He is polite, deferential, and speaks softly with a wisdom beyond his meager years. His only outdoor interests are walking among the gardens atop the plateau, where he studies plants and insects, and launching complex flying toys made of wood and folded paper out the window of his room and watching them glide lazily across the jungle. **Na** would laugh, and then be aghast, if anyone suggested he would make a better monarch than Mwaxanaré.

> ##### When Gargoyles Attack
>The gargoyles of Omu and the aarakocra of Kir Sabal are bitter enemies. Aarakocra scouts watch over the distant city, and their brazen intrusion annoys the gargoyles. Once in a while, gargoyles follow a patrol back to Kir Sabal and attack the monastery. If this happens while the characters are visiting Kir Sabal, the aarakocra appreciate whatever help the party can provide. The attacking force consists of ten gargoyles. If six or more are slain, the rest fly back to Omu.

#### 1. Monastery
Six **aarakocra** inhabit the monastery, living as monks. While in the monastery, they wear prayer bead necklaces and paint labyrinthine patterns on their beaks, hands, and feet.

A large, circular labyrinth symbol of Ubtao is painted on the face of this building, but it can't be seen from anywhere in Kir Sabal; it's visible only from the air or from the ground below.

***1A. Refectory.*** The entrance hall of the monastery is also the dining chamber. The aarakocra monks take all their meals here, but it's also where meetings take place. The aarakocra use backless benches and stools for seats, to accommodate their wings. The table can seat twenty.

***1B. Prayer Hall.*** This is the main hall of the monastery, and it's an impressive sight. The rafters of the ceiling are fully 60 feet above the floor, and the peak of the thatched roof is 15 feet above that. The space is large enough that aarakocra can fly inside it, though they seldom do for the sake of decorum.

The circular labyrinth symbol of Ubtao is laid out on a floor mosaic 25 feet in diameter. The aarakocra monks spend much of their days meditating while viewing the labyrinth from the lower and upper landings of the staircase. Other aarakocra come here only on special occasions such as weddings, funerals, and holy days.

***1C. Masters' Quarters.*** The aarakocra monks use these sleeping chambers. Each chamber contains a bunk bed and a small table for a candle and washbasin. The monks have no possessions; even their clothes and prayer beads belong to the monastery.

***1D. Antechamber.*** Before entering the shrine, the monks prepare themselves in this antechamber by washing with scented oils, reading from inspirational scrolls, and painting labyrinthine patterns onto their beaks, hands, and feet.

***1E. Shrine.*** A life-size wooden statue of a noble tabaxi stands against the far wall, draped in flowers and beads and wreathed in incense smoke. Unlike the other statues in Kir Sabal, this one is in excellent condition, though it's still very old. It can be recognized as a portrayal of Ubtao in tabaxi form with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check. The aarakocra don't know the statue as Ubtao; they revere it simply as a talisman that safeguards Kir Sabal and as a focus for meditation.

***1F. Training Hall.*** The aarakocra monks use this hall for instruction in meditation and martial arts. It contains no furniture except woven grass mats.

#### 2. Cleansing Chambers
Aarakocra ritually cleanse themselves in this building before visiting the monastery. This is also where they leave offerings for Teacher and their mysterious guardian figure (the statues of Ubtao as a tabaxi).

***2A. Washroom.*** The lower chamber contains a wash basin for performing ablutions and smaller vessels of salt, powdered chalk, and gold dust (50 gp worth) for sprinkling onto one's feathers before visiting the monastery.

***2B. Shrine.*** The upper chamber contains a wooden case with shelves of candles and head scarves for visitors to the monastery. At the east end of the chamber is a 5-foot-tall wooden statue with flowers and offerings of food placed at its feet. The statue is obviously very old, and it's worn almost smooth by thousands of hands brushing against it, so it's impossible to determine what it originally portrayed. Offerings left here are picked up daily by **Asharra**'s servant and placed on the statues in the monastery or the elder's house.

#### 3. Elder's House
**Asharra** and an elderly female **aarakocra** servant named Yingmatona (pronounced ying-mah-TOE-nah) live in this grand structure. No other aarakocra ever set foot inside. Mwaxanaré visits occasionally, and only **Na** is allowed to come and go as he pleases. This building is off-limits to the characters unless they're invited inside. Trespassing in the Teacher's home is a horrendous breach of hospitality.

***3A. Shrine.*** The lower floor of the house is a single room. Yingmatona sleeps on a mattress under the stairs. A life-size wooden statue resembling a tabaxi stands opposite the door. Flowers and offerings of food are placed at its feet. The statue is obviously very old and carved in the stylized Chultan manner, so a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check is needed to recognize it as a depiction of Ubtao as a tabaxi. This realization is automatic if someone already figured it out in the monastery.

The walls of the chamber bear faded frescoes of floral designs and—somewhat jarringly—mathematical symbols. A section of floor has collapsed from age. Anything falling through plunges hundreds of feet to the rocks below.

***3B. Asharra's Quarters.*** The upper floor is decorated with frescoes similar to those on the lower floor. The landing atop the stairs has no windows, being set inside the cliff, but it's dimly lit by two candles (one at each end of the hallway).

The outer room is a library with a single bookcase holding forty-four ancient books. **Na** likes to come here and read the books, none of which is magical. They cover most areas of knowledge: mathematics, natural philosophy, geography, fabulous creatures, theology, and so forth. All the books predate the Spellplague, so little useful information about Chult can be gleaned from them.

The inner room is **Asharra**'s personal chamber. It contains a comfortable bed, a nightstand, a few books of Chultan poetry, and a wardrobe holding everyday and ceremonial clothing. Under the bed is a small, closed box holding four *potions of poison* that are easily mistaken for *potions of healing*. **Asharra** might resort to these if the characters' presence in Kir Sabal becomes inconvenient.

#### 4. Dwellings
The dwellings in Kir Sabal aren't all identical, but they're similar enough. Each is occupied by 2d4 **aarakocra**. A standard dwelling has two or three levels connected by a ladder (the interiors are too tight for flying). Most aarakocra in Kir Sabal have little in the way of valuables, aside from totems handcrafted from wood, feathers, scales, shells, and teeth.

#### 5. Royal House
Perched between the monastery (area 1) and the elder's house (area 3) is a dwelling similar to the ones described in area 4. However, this particular house is furnished for humans and belongs to Mwaxanaré and **Na**. It is much finer than the others, as befits their royal status.

***Treasure.*** Mwaxanaré has many beautiful trinkets: silver brushes and mirrors, crystal perfume bottles, writing quills made from multicolored parrot feathers, jewels for braiding into her hair, necklaces and rings set with fiery Chultan opals and amber. All together, these are worth 330 gp, but to be caught in Kir Sabal with items stolen from Mwaxanaré means death—and since no one in Kir Sabal would ever steal, suspicion automatically falls on the characters if anything disappears.

### Kitcher's Inlet
The River Olung pours into this shallow bay named after Ilyber Kitcher, a pompous Cormyrean explorer who claimed to have discovered it a few centuries ago. He did no such thing, of course; the inlet's existence and location were well known before Kitcher missed the Bay of Chult (he was a terrible navigator) and unknowingly sailed down the peninsula's eastern coast before a storm blew him back within sight of land. There is nothing remarkable about the inlet, other than it provides access to the ruins of Port Castigliar and Mezro.

### Lake Luo
This lake sits above an immense geothermal sink, where it's heated by volcanic vents and by lava streaming down from the Valley of Embers. Portions of the lake are actually boiling, sending up clouds of steam that can be seen for miles. The water is too hot and too alkaline for fish or any other type of aquatic life to survive in it, and the shore around the lake is a dead wasteland of ash and salt flats. Aside from mud mephits and steam mephits, few creatures thrive in the area. The water cools and loses most of its alkalinity as it flows north along the River Olung.

### Land of Ash and Smoke
This hellish, smoky sea of black volcanic rock is traced with streams of lava. The Land of Ash and Smoke is a playground for firenewts and for Tzindelor, a young red dragon (see "Wyrmheart Mine"), who likes to bathe in the lava streams. This gray, barren valley is typically 20 to 40 degrees hotter than anywhere else in Chult. It receives only a fraction of the rain that falls on the rest of the peninsula, and what rain does fall rapidly evaporates in the punishing heat. Several expeditions have tried to explore the area, but most of what's known about it (and shown on **Syndra Silvane**'s map) is based on visual observations made from atop the coastal mountains.

### Mbala

>>A 1,800-foot-high plateau with sheer cliffs rises above heaps of boulders as large as ships. A narrow path is cut into the cliff face and seems to climb all the way to the top.
>>

The plateau's sheer cliffs can be scaled, but only with a climbing kit, proficiency in the Athletics skill, and at least 300 feet of rope.

The path is a much easier route to the top. It begins on the north side of the plateau. Through many switchbacks, it winds across the cliff face for 3 miles before reaching the top. The path width varies but averages 5 feet. Tumbled boulders and tangled roots block the path in many places, but as long as characters aren't being chased by anything, they can clear the obstructions safely. The first ascent takes 3 hours; once the road is cleared, it can be climbed or descended in half that time.

As the characters climb ever higher above the tree line, they are treated to stunning views of the surrounding wilderness. Across the Aldani Basin to the southeast, they can see the Heart of Ubtao, and nestled in the jungle to the west is the ziggurat at Orolunga. Characters who succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check also spot some sort of shipwreck in the jungle, beyond the plateaus to the south (see "Wreck of the Star Goddess").

About a hundred feet below the lip of the plateau, the path (which is proceeding west across the cliff at that point) veers directly into a natural cleft in the stone face. Steps are cut into the 15-foot-wide crevice, and scenes of jungle predators, flying lizards, and erupting volcanoes are carved in shallow relief onto the walls in ways that make creative use of the natural shape of the rock. When the characters reach the top of the steps, read:

>>The stone steps emerge onto the top of the plateau beneath a once grand, but now decrepit wooden gateway. The gates that sealed this entrance are rotted away; only their rusted iron hinges and reinforcing bands remain. In their place are heaps of human skulls. Picked clean of all flesh and bleached white by the sun, they grin up at you from the roadway and down from atop towering mounds.
>>

The skulls are all that remain of Mbala's former residents. The citizens were devoured by a hag posing as a witch doctor. All the skulls show signs of having been gnawed on. The hag is now Mbala's sole living resident.

To move off the steps, characters must either wade through heaps of skulls or climb over the sides of the staircase and go around the gate. Evidence of a wooden palisade can be seen, but it, too, is almost entirely gone or fallen over.

Mbala was once the seat of a small kingdom. Most of the structures were wood and thatch, and they're now just crumbling compost heaps demolished by rain, wind, and time. A few stone foundations and overgrown ramps poke up through the debris, indicating this was more than just a simple village.

#### Nanny Pu'pu
If the characters explore the ruins of Mbala, read:

>>The only structure still intact is a lone hut about a thousand yards southwest of the gate, at the edge of a boulder field. The hut is made from thatch and animal hides stretched over the rib cage of an immense reptile. Animal skulls, wind chimes, and totems of feathers and shells rattle in the breeze, and smoke drifts from hut.
>>
>>A creature shuffles slowly around the hut, hunched over in an animal-like posture. You realize it's a human woman: impossibly old, crippled by arthritis, blinded by cataracts. Her dark face and bald pate are outlined with streaks of yellow clay suggesting the shape of a skull—or perhaps it's her shriveled flesh creating that illusion.
>>

![[042-0318.webp|right|300]]

**Nanny Pu'pu**, a **green hag**, plays the part of an ancient crone to the hilt. She claims that all the other villagers were killed over the course of many years by winged creatures that live on the south side of the plateau. She is the only survivor—too stringy or too wily for the predators. She lives on the roots in her garden and the few birds and lizards she catches in snares. If asked her name, she needs several moments to recall that the villagers called her **Nanny Pu'pu**.

The hag wants two things from the adventurers: for them to destroy the nest of pterafolk on the south side of the plateau (see "Pterafolk Nest" below), and then to become her meals for several months. She's not likely to attack them openly. She'd rather get them off their guard and pick them off one by one, as she did with the villagers.

**Nanny Pu'pu** isn't entirely alone. With a whistle, she can call forth 2d6 **flying monkeys** (see *appendix D*) that live in the trees, and she has a **flesh golem** buried in a shallow grave outside her small hut. The hag uses the flying monkeys to gather food and supplies, but they won't fight for her. The golem will, however; it erupts from the earth as a bonus action if commanded to attack.

#### Rite of Stolen Life
**Nanny Pu'pu** is a worshiper of Myrkul, the Lord of Bones, and knows a ritual of transformation that can turn a dead humanoid into a zombielike creature. Characters who bring their dead comrades to Mbala can ask **Nanny Pu'pu** to transform them into the walking dead. However, she does nothing for free. Wiping out the nest of pterafolk is the least payment she'll consider for this ritual. She might also request a lock of Commander Breakbone's hair and a few of his fingernails (see "Camp Vengeance") or one of Saja N'baza's iridescent scales (see "Orolunga"). Either would certainly be used in casting evil magic.

**Nanny Pu'pu** is the only creature in Chult who can perform the Rite of Stolen Life. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires three things: a mostly intact humanoid corpse, a gemstone worth at least 100 gp, and, most disturbingly, the sacrifice of another humanoid. If characters are unwilling to sacrifice one of their own to save a fallen comrade, **Nanny Pu'pu** recommends they capture a goblin, a grung, or other humanoid and bring it to her. **Nanny Pu'pu** kills the sacrifice, captures its spirit in the gemstone, and magically embeds the stone in the dead humanoid's forehead. After **Nanny Pu'pu** speaks a prayer to Myrkul, the spirit of the sacrifice gains the knowledge and the personality of the humanoid to which it is bound, in effect imitating that humanoid's spirit. When the ritual is complete, the dead humanoid awakens as if from a deep slumber, though it is not alive.

A character transformed by this ritual into the walking dead regains all its hit points and retains its statistics, except as noted here:

- The character is considered an undead, not a humanoid, and is subject to all effects that target undead. The character doesn't need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe.
- The character's hit point maximum is reduced by 1d4 at dawn each day, representing the physical decay of the body. No spell or effect can halt or counteract this decay.
- If the character's hit point maximum drops to 0, the gemstone embedded in the character's forehead shatters, and the character becomes a corpse once more.

A character that is turned into the walking dead and later raised or resurrected loses all memory of being an undead creature, but it doesn't lose any levels or XP gained while it was undead.

#### Treasure
The green hag keeps nothing of value in her hut. Her treasure is hidden in a cistern in the old village. Anyone who moves through the ruins notices the cistern. The opening is 15 feet in diameter, and the shaft drops 15 feet to scummy, black water. The lip and walls of the cistern are brick-lined.

The water is 40 feet deep and so murky that it's heavily obscured. Unless characters have blindsight, they must feel their way with their hands. About 20 feet below the surface, the bricks have been pulled from one wall to create a hole. Characters searching with their hands find it with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. A narrow, 10-foot-long tunnel leads from the hole to a cramped, completely flooded chamber. In the chamber is a tied sack made from human skin. It contains six onyx gemstones (50 gp each), a *spell scroll* of *comprehend languages*, and ten adamantine ingots (10 gp each) stamped with dwarven runes. These are identical to the ingots found in Hrakhamar (see "Hrakhamar").

If characters miss the hole in the wall as they're searching down the cistern wall, they find a heap of bricks on the bottom of the cistern. Searching upward from the discarded bricks leads them to the hole automatically.

#### Pterafolk Nest
A flock of twenty pterafolk nests in a cave just below the southern lip of the plateau. It can be reached by climbing down the cliff face, but characters who scout the area carefully and succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check locate a chute in the rocks 70 feet back from the cliff. This chimney is wide enough for a Small creature, or for a Medium creature who's wearing nothing heavier than light armor, to squeeze through. After worming down 30 feet, it drops into the back of the pterafolk cave, which is roughly triangular in floor plan: 30 feet wide at the mouth, 60 feet deep, and 20 feet high. The pterafolk are unaware that this back entrance to their cave exists.

The pterafolk keep no watch, believing their cliffside retreat is impregnable. Stealthy characters can enter the cave unnoticed. At any given time, 2d6 **pterafolk** (see *appendix D*) are present in the cave. The rest are out hunting, but they'll return before nightfall.

***Treasure.*** In the back half of the cave are the bodies of two partially eaten explorers. A discarded backpack near them contains 6 gp in a pouch, a silvered dagger, and a *potion of greater healing*.

### Mezro
Nothing about this Chultan city is what it seems. By all accounts, Mezro was destroyed by the Spellplague, and its ruins indicate as much. In truth, the city's immortal defenders—the barae—used their god-given magic to transport the entire city to a paradise (a magically constructed demiplane, far from prying eyes). Empty ruins were left behind to create the impression that Mezro had been destroyed. It is not known if and when the Mezroans and their city will return.

One of the barae, a human paladin named Alisanda, is wed to **Artus Cimber**. The two fell in love more than a century ago, after Artus helped defend Mezro against the evil warlord **Ras Nsi** and his undead horde. Before she allowed herself to be spirited away along with the rest of the city, Alisanda promised Artus that she would return to Chult when the city was no longer in peril.

Artus won't endanger the Mezroans by revealing the truth about their city. Although the *Ring of Winter* makes him immortal, he has grown impatient in the intervening years and longs for Alisanda's return. He visits the ruins from time to time to see what, if anything, has changed. When he's not at the ruins, he's searching the jungles of Chult for Orolunga, another ruined city, in the hopes of consulting with a prescient guardian naga believed to dwell there.

#### Exploring the Ruins
The ruins that were left behind form a circle. Four main avenues to the north, south, east, and west meet at a central plaza. The whole ruin has subsided over the centuries, so that water from the River Olung flows over the ancient wharfs. Crumbling, vine-covered buildings rise above the flooded streets that are now more like canals than roadways. The site is eerily quiet.

The ruins have been thoroughly ransacked by the Flaming Fist in the name of Baldur's Gate, and Flaming Fist patrols still visit the site regularly—partly as training for new recruits, partly to make sure nothing was missed. Neither treasure nor clues remain for the player characters to find here.

### Mistcliff
The Mistcliff is a 1,000-foot-high wall of volcanic rock that stretches for 200 miles along Chult's west coast. There is no beach whatsoever, just immense, jagged rocks and plunging, crashing waves. If that isn't enough to keep most people away, the cliffs are home to large aarakocra settlements, as well as nests of pteranodons and quetzalcoatluses.

### Nangalore
This great garden (map 2.12) was built to honor Zalkoré, a vain Omuan queen. Its builder, Thiru-taya, was Zalkoré's foremost general and consort. In their time, the garden was called Ka-Nanji, the Hanging Garden of Dreams. Ka-Nanji was a palatial retreat from the intrigues and pressures of Omu, and the beautiful, tiered garden was praised as a worthy tribute to the queen.

Unceasing flattery festered with poisonous vanity in Zalkoré's mind until she bargained with an erinyes to retain her youth and beauty forever. The erinyes fulfilled the deal by transforming the queen into a medusa. When knowledge of her evil bargain spread through the realm, the army forced Zalkoré to abdicate and exiled her to Ka-Nanji, which became known ever after as Nangalore, the Garden of Lost Dreams.

Believing that Thiru-taya was among the generals who exiled her, Zalkoré defaced all the statues and portraits of him in Nangalore. She learned he had stayed true to her all his life, through decades of imprisonment and disgrace in Omu, only when his ashes were brought to the garden for interment, as was his dying wish. Zalkoré cultivates hallucinogenic plants in the garden, because only in their narcotic, lotus dreams can she conjure up the face of her dead love.

Characters can discover Zalkoré's tragic story by interpreting carvings throughout the garden. If that makes them sympathetic toward her, so be it, but her tragedy didn't ennoble Zalkoré or make her a better person; it turned her into a monster.

The medusa is not alone in the cursed garden. Eblis serve her as sentinels and spies. Colorful parrots and canaries flock to the garden's great variety of plants, some of which are hostile toward visitors. Finally, brave Chultans sometimes seek out Zalkoré as a sort of jungle mystic, either to learn the secrets of her hallucinogenic plants or to ask questions about the distant past.

Nangalore lies a half-mile from the River Olung. Thanks to centuries of silting and erosion, one of the river's tributaries floods right up to the garden gate (area 1), making the site easy to reach by boat. Traveling to Nangalore by foot is a nightmare, since the land within 1 mile is nothing but boggy marsh.

The garden has multiple levels. Map 2.12 uses elevation markers to indicate how high the levels are relative to the ground. Some keyed locations contain multiple levels; for example, area 4 is 25 feet above ground level, with a crumbled 10-foot-high balcony (35 feet above ground level) and a 20-foot-deep pit (5 feet above ground level).

Throughout Nangalore are inscriptions written in Old Omuan. A character with the Cloistered Scholar or Sage background can translate an Old Omuan inscription with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check. A warlock with the Eyes of the Rune Keeper invocation can do so automatically. Otherwise, a *comprehend languages* spell or similar magic is needed.

![[044-0319a.webp|right|300]]
#### 1. Entrance

>>A fantastic edifice rises up out of the jungle: a hanging garden of exotic beauty. Water streams down the steps between two massive elephant carvings. Beyond them, a broad, flooded avenue runs arrow-straight for more than a hundred feet before ending at a carving of a tyrannosaurus face. Water pours from the tyrannosaurus's jaws and flows the length of the concourse to drain down the steps in front of you. Five-foot-high terraces flank the boulevard. Low archways—three on each side—are built into the terrace walls. These archways are in various stages of collapse, as are the tunnels beyond them. Beautifully carved, larger-than-life stone faces are mounted between the arches.
>>
>>A wild profusion of plants grows on the upper terraces, and multicolored parrots and canaries flit and sing among them. To the north, a dilapidated brick dome rises above the tyrannosaurus-head waterspout. Smaller, bell-shaped domes surmount the highest terraces to your left and right.
>>

Four **crocodiles** live in the flooded marsh south of the garden. They ignore characters in boats, attack anyone in the water, and won't climb up the stairs.

The water flowing down the main concourse is only 1 foot deep, and the current isn't particularly strong. Originally, the six side branches off the main avenue were roofed over, but two of the roofs have caved in, and three others are partially collapsed. Debris chokes the walkways where the tunnel roofs fell. The roofs that remain intact have vines and roots hanging down from them. The covered tunnels are only 4 feet high and contain a foot of water.

***Stone Faces.*** The four stone visages staring across the avenue between the walkways portray a regal woman (Zalkoré) whose expression changes slightly with each visage. Inscribed above each face are phrases in Old Omuan. The phrases form a message. To get the message in sequence, it should be read from the south end of the concourse to the tyrannosaurus spout while alternating from the left (west) side to the right (east).

Face 1 (lower west) has a bemused expression. The message above it reads, "This garden is dedicated to Zalkoré, queen of Omu and jewel of Chult."

Face 2 (upper west) has a condescending expression. The message above it reads, "Worshiped by her people and by Thiru-taya, who loves BETRAYED her." (The word "loves" has been chipped away, and the word "BETRAYED" is scratched into the stone above it.)

Face 3 (upper east) has a stern expression. The message above it reads, "In this, the tenth year of her reign, may she govern forever in splendor."

Face 4 (lower east) has a serene expression. The message above it reads, "And may the gods themselves marvel at this humble reflection of her beauty."

#### 2. Terraces

>>Untamed overgrowth can't hide the fact that this garden is a haven for exotic plants that don't grow naturally in the surrounding jungle. Unfamiliar flowers, towering ferns, and even stranger plants resembling giant pine cones or lily pads spread and tangle everywhere. Bright canaries flit between them, and parrots with striped beaks squawk at you.
>>

These terraces overlooking the main concourse are home to myriad creatures, many of them dangerous.

A **mantrap** (see *appendix D*) grows on the eastern terrace between two of the partially collapsed tunnels. When it senses movement within 30 feet of it, the mantrap releases its attractive pollen.

Characters who explore the western terrace encounter six **yellow musk zombies** (see *appendix D*) lurking among the trees and plants. The zombies blend in with their surroundings, and any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score lower than 12 is automatically surprised by them. Coiled around the northernmost tree on the western terrace is a **yellow musk creeper** (see *appendix D*) that uses its musk when one or more characters come within 30 feet of it.

At the north end of the garden, two arched doorways open into the southwest and southeast flower gardens (area 5). Steps still climb up to the doorway on the east, but the western steps collapsed and fell into the walkway below. A character can reach the western doorway with an easy jump and a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to catch the ledge.

***Garden Discoveries.*** A character who spends at least 10 minutes searching a garden terrace for treasure inevitably stumbles upon a hidden creature or exotic plant, determined by rolling a d20 and consulting the Garden Discoveries table. After the party makes five such discoveries, no more canbe found.

##### Garden Discoveries
| d20 | Discovery |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | 1d4 **almiraj** (see *appendix D*) |
| 2–3 | 1 **assassin vine** (see *appendix D*) |
| 4–5 | 1 **chwinga** (see *appendix D*) hiding in a flower |
| 6–7 | 1d4 **flying monkeys** (see *appendix D*) perched in a tree. The monkeys playfully hurl dancing monkey fruit (see appendix C) at nearby characters. They fly away if attacked. |
| 8–9 | 1d4 **jaculis** (see *appendix D*) |
| 10–11 | Menga bush with 2d6 ounces of leaves (see appendix C) |
| 12–13 | 1d4 ryath roots (see appendix C) |
| 14–15 | 4d6 sinda berries growing on a bush (see appendix C) |
| 16–17 | 1d4 wildroots (see appendix C) |
| 18–19 | Yahcha beetle (see appendix C) |
| 20 | The rotting corpse of a human mage who was strangled to death by an assassin vine. A search of the corpse yields a scholar's pack, a pouch containing 15 gp, and a *folding boat*. This discovery can only be made once. If this result comes up again, re-roll on the table. |

#### 3. Spirit Domes

>>A bell-shaped dome of sculpted stone rises from the end of each upper walkway. The dome to the east is beginning to crumble with age. The one to the west is wrapped and draped with thick webs.
>>

These two domes were built to attract nature spirits.

***Western Dome.*** This dome has been taken over by a **giant spider** missing one of its legs. The seven-legged arachnid lurks in its webs and attacks anyone who approaches within 10 feet of its home. Characters who kill the spider and search the webs find the cocooned, desiccated corpses of an albino dwarf and a goblin, but no treasure.

***Eastern Dome.*** Three **chwingas** (see *appendix D*) live in this dome. They emerge from the stone to spy on creatures that pass by. One chwinga is fascinated by tall people and might bestow a *charm of restoration* (see *chapter 7* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) on the tallest party member, should it take a shine to the party. The other two chwingas are shy and suspicious of strangers.

#### 4. Ruined Palace

>>Traces of gold-colored plaster still cling to this dome in a few spots, but everywhere else you see old weathered bricks, more than a few of which have fallen through. The larger-than-life-size elephant carvings and the graceful, towering spire are still magnificent sights, even if their glory is dimmed by time and decay.
>>

A character can climb the outside of the dome with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) and peer inside through any one of a number of holes. The top of the dome has been weakened by time and collapses under the weight of a creature weighing 200 pounds or more. Any creature standing on or clinging to the roof when it collapses falls, taking damage as normal and possibly landing in the cistern.

Iron doors on the eastern side of the dome are rusted shut and can be forced open only with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check—but the impact causes a portion of the ceiling to collapse. Whoever forced the doors open must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Identical doors on the western side of the dome are rusted completely off their hinges.

When characters enter the ruined palace, read:

>>An 18-foot-tall stone statue of a Chultan warrior in splint armor, wearing a helmet festooned with tyrannosaurus teeth and bearing a shield of intricately patterned leopard hide, towers over the chamber and looms above a wide, octagonal cistern. The chamber echoes with the sound of rainwater dripping from the ceiling into the gaping pit. The face of the giant warrior statue is obliterated by deep gouges, but the rest of the statue remains intact. Clutched in the statue's right hand is a stone spear, and resting on the floor beneath it is a clay urn. North of the statue is an open balcony overlooking a flooded garden.
>>
>>Standing to one side of the giant warrior is another statue, this one much smaller. Exquisitely lifelike, it depicts a man reaching for the urn, his face turned toward the balcony. In his lifeless eyes, you see terror.
>>
>>Stone steps ascend along the curved wall to the level of a second floor, but that floor is almost entirely collapsed. Someone's been up there, however, because a message of some sort is scrawled across the domed ceiling.
>>

When it was intact, the second floor was actually a mezzanine that wrapped around three sides of the dome. The head, chest, and shoulders of the warrior statue rose above the mezzanine level.

The 20-foot-deep pit contains 1d4 + 2 inches of rainwater and is home to two **swarms of poisonous snakes**. The swarms are content to remain in the pit and attack any creature that joins them, except for Zalkoré, whom the snakes obey. The walls of the pit can't be climbed without gear or magic.

Rainwater pouring into the pit through holes in the roof drains via pipes through the tyrannosaurus spout at the head of the main concourse (area 1). The snakes can also come and go through the pipes, which are 6 inches wide.

***Mezzanine Message.*** The message scrawled on the inside of the dome can be read only by climbing to the mezzanine, but the decrepit condition of the stairs and balcony makes this venture risky. A character who climbs the steps must make a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to move without jarring the flooring; otherwise, the steps collapse and the character takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall. A Small character has advantage on the check. Without the steps, climbing the inward-curving wall requires a climbing kit and a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

The message, scrawled in Old Omuan, states, "True love, faithful general, safe will you rest in Nangalore eternal. None will disturb you while I live. Such is my vow of penance, and for my sins I cannot die."

***Statues.*** The large statue portrays Thiru-taya. Zalkoré had it commissioned out of appreciation and affection, but defaced it when she believed the general betrayed her. The face is completely destroyed. Gouged across its back in Old Omuan are the words "Forgive me."

The smaller statue is actually a petrified adventurer named Gowl (NG male Chultan human **scout**). He came to Nangalore in search of riches and was turned to stone by Zalkoré while reaching for the urn. Scratched into the floor next to him are the following words, in Old Omuan: "Once a thief, forever a slave!"

***Urn.*** The clay urn contains Thiru-taya's ashes.

#### 5. Hallucinogenic Plants
Zalkoré cultivates hallucinogenic plants in these four sheltered gardens. From the plants, she brews a narcotic tincture that allows her to dream of Thiru-taya. Without it, she can't recall his face.

>>The plants in this enclosed garden are like nothing you've ever seen. Their shapes are fantastic, and their colors are like gems sparkling in the sun. Enclosed by 5-foot-high walls, this strangely beautiful garden imparts a sense of serenity.
>>
>>A message is deeply scratched into the wall.
>>

Four of these gardens are situated around the palace (area 4). Any humanoid that spends 1 minute or longer in any one of them must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the creature is also charmed by every other creature in Nangalore. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour, ending the effect on itself on a success. If any saving throw after the initial one fails by 5 or more, the creature falls unconscious and remains so until it takes damage or until it succeeds on a saving throw against this effect.

A character who has proficiency in both Medicine and Nature recognizes these plants as soporifics after 2 rounds of examination. A character with proficiency in either skill, but not both, recognizes the plants with a successful DC 15 check in the trained skill.

A single character who spends 30 minutes in a garden can strip it of its hallucinogenic plants, gathering 3 pounds of leaves in the process. **Jessamine** (see chapter 1) is willing to pay 20 gp for each pound of leaves.

Zalkoré and the eblis don't miss the opportunity to strike while characters are drugged, or to offer them poisoned fruit and wine if they've done nothing offensive (see *area 8*).

***5A. Southwest Garden.*** An open archway in the south wall of the garden overlooks a flooded tunnel with a collapsed roof (see area 1). Written on the south wall in Old Omuan are the words "Without dreams, eternity is unbearable."

***5B. Southeast Garden.*** Three **tri-flower fronds** (see *appendix D*) grow in this garden. Any character who moves through the garden can't help but brush up against one of these beautiful but deadly plants. Written on the south wall in Old Omuan are the words "Great Ubtao, free me!"

***5C. Northwest Garden.*** The steps leading to the upper walkway are overgrown by tree roots. Scrawled on the north wall in Old Omuan are the words "For the lies of a few, all must pay."

***5D. Northeast Garden.*** This garden has been taken over by a **mantrap** (see *appendix D*), which lies hidden under other plants. It attacks any creature that's not Zalkoré or an eblis. Scrawled on the east wall in Old Omuan are the words "To dream, to dance."

#### 6. Pagoda

>>This crumbling pagoda must have been lovely once, with its wide, graceful arches inviting the breeze to blow through, and overlooking the silent pool below. But time, decay, and some bestial presence have given it a sinister air. It smells foul, and dark stains cover the floor and seep down the white steps.
>>

This pagoda houses six **eblis** (see *appendix D*) that serve as Zalkoré's sentries and servants. The interior is filthy, with gnawed bones strewn everywhere and the floor thick with droppings. Unless the characters creep through the garden with uncommon stealth, the eblis see or hear them coming, in which case this nest will be empty. Three eblis move to Zalkoré's lair (*area 8*), while the others take up positions in trees, on walls, or on rooftops. Their job is not to attack intruders on sight, but to alert Zalkoré and be ready to back up whatever she does.

***Treasure.*** Characters who search through the refuse find some baubles tucked away by the eblis, including a pouch containing seven assorted gemstones (10 gp each), a painted gold bracelet shaped like a couatl (50 gp), and a wooden scroll tube engraved with skeletons, which contains a *scroll of protection**(undead)*.

#### 7. Flooded Garden

>>The water in this pool is unusually clear. A dozen or more large fish, turtles, and lizards swim lazily through it, and waterbirds paddle on the surface. Their ripples obscure something on the bottom of the pool, so you can't quite make it out, but the bottom appears to be blanketed in oddly shaped stones.
>>
>>Bits of shattered stone rest atop a square dais that rises from the middle of the pool—evidence of a sculpture that once stood atop it. Part of the sculpture lies in the pool, west of the dais: a large stone face staring up at the sky.
>>

An immense stone bust of Zalkoré once rose above the pool atop the dais. It was the most beautiful sculpture in the garden. After Zalkoré learned the truth about Thiru-taya, she destroyed the likeness of herself in an act of self-revulsion.

The stones in the pool are a 2-foot-deep layer of fish, turtles, lizards, and water birds petrified by Zalkoré as they swam in the water. They've been piling up in the bottom of the pool for centuries. The petrified animals could be sold to collectors in Port Nyanzaru for 1 gp apiece. Each one weighs 1 pound. Beneath the petrified animals are the petrified forms of Kwani and Shabarra, two adventurers (CN female Chultan **scouts**) who ran afoul of Zalkoré many decades ago.

#### 8. Zalkoré's Lair
This bell-shaped dome appears intact: it has no obvious holes in the roof, and the bronze double door hangs squarely in its frame. The doors are closed but not locked. Unless characters have been uncommonly stealthy (or Zalkoré is already dead), the queen is expecting them.

>>The single, large chamber inside the dome is obviously a royal apartment—or was, centuries ago. Now the bright, floral murals are dim and gray, bits of colored glass are heaped beneath a cracked mosaic, enameled wooden tables are split and tilting, and every bit of cloth is frayed and streaked.
>>
>>At the center of the room, a long divan stands atop a circular dais. Reclining on the divan is a woman dressed in a flowing robe made from parrot feathers in stunning colors. Despite the heat, her arms, head, and face are covered in feathery veils. Next to her, a black orchid grows out of a large clay pot at the head of the divan. She addresses you in a voice tinged with odd inflections. "Strangers have come to Nangalore, my love. What boon do our subjects beseech?"
>>

The **medusa** isn't completely insane, but thanks to her plant extract, she continually hallucinates that Thiru-taya is standing at her side. Most of Zalkoré's comments include him somehow; try to make these references as puzzling as possible for the characters. She also believes that she's still queen of Omu while simultaneously remembering and understanding that she was exiled here. She can make contradictory statements about herself and her past without any apparent cognitive dissonance.

Characters can have a pleasant, somewhat informative encounter with Zalkoré if they abide by three conditions:

- Disturbing Thiru-taya's ashes or damaging his statue are unpardonable. If characters did either, then a fight to the death is guaranteed.
- The first time someone makes a disparaging remark about Thiru-taya or refers to his "betrayal," they draw a furious response from Zalkoré, but she recomposes herself. If it happens a second time, a battle is assured.
- If someone snatches away Zalkoré's veil, makes a grab for the black orchid, or brings out a mirror, their fate is sealed. If someone asks why she wears a veil, Zalkoré replies that she no longer desires to show her face to anyone but her beloved Thiru-taya.

As long as the meeting remains cordial, Zalkoré can reveal much about Omu. She can direct characters to its general location ("between the fire peaks and the great iron mine of the dwarves") and warns them that yuan-ti covet the city. She knows nothing about the Soulmonger or the death curse. She's heard that at least one of her descendants is in hiding with the bird folk of Kir Sabal, awaiting the restoration of the monarchy. (These are examples of how Zalkoré simultaneously thinks of herself as still the ruling queen of Omu as it was centuries ago, and is also aware the city has fallen and she's in exile. Both situations coexist in her hallucinatory reality.)

***Black Orchid.*** Characters in search of a black orchid for **Asharra**'s ritual (see "Kir Sabal") find one here, but Zalkoré won't part with it unless the characters offer her something of equal beauty. As payment, she demands a gemstone, a piece of jewelry, or an art object worth at least 500 gp. (She won't accept lesser quality goods of equal value.) Zalkoré is also attracted to characters with a Charisma of 16 or higher and will accept one such character as a slave in exchange for the flower. The black orchid in Zalkoré's possession is the only one to be found in Nangalore.

***Poisonous Hospitality.*** If Zalkoré resolves to kill the characters over an offense but the situation is still more-or-less cordial, she offers food and drink. She rings a silver handbell, and an **eblis** servant (see *appendix D*) arrives with a tray of fruit and wine. All of it is artfully drugged; the contamination can be detected only by someone who has proficiency in Medicine and who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Zalkoré partakes, but she's built up such a tolerance that this dose won't affect her. Characters who eat or drink must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour or until they drink 2 quarts of water.

***Thiru-Taya.*** When Zalkoré is reduced to 63 hit points or fewer, she calls out to her dead lover for protection. The spirit of Thiru-Taya answers the call, appearing as a barely visible 10-foot-tall apparition of a Chultan warrior wielding a massive spear of force. The apparition is impervious to damage and spells, and it can't be turned or controlled. It looms above Zalkoré until she dies or regains all her hit points. Once per turn, when a creature within 15 feet of Zalkoré damages her, Thiru-Taya's apparition unerringly hits the attacker with its spear, dealing 15 (2d8 + 6) force damage to it.

***Treasure.*** Most of what remains in Zalkoré's lair has little value. Her feathered dress is worth 50 gp, if it wasn't too damaged in the fight (the dress is ruined if more than half the damage done to Zalkoré was slashing, acid, or fire damage, or if she was hit by a *fireball* or similar effect). Her lair contains 2d6 vials of her dreaming tincture. Each vial contains a single dose and can be sold for 10 gp in Port Nyanzaru. Any character that drinks a dose of the tincture must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Characters who are immune to the poisoned condition succeed automatically. On a failed save, the character begins to experience illusory sights, sounds, smells, and sensations that seem real. Casting a *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic on the character ends the effect, which otherwise lasts for 1d4 + 4 hours.

### Needle's Bones

>>A wide sinkhole yawns before you, the earth around it littered with goblin bones. The opening is 90 feet across and roughly circular, and the stone walls are nearly vertical. Thirty feet down, the sinkhole is filled with murky green water. Hundreds of frogs hop from one floating plant to another.
>>
>>The massive rib cage and fine wing bones of a dragon rise above the murk. Vines, moss, and lichen hang from the bones. Judging from how much of the skeleton is exposed, the water can't be more than 3 or 4 feet deep.
>>

The walls of the sinkhole are rough and draped with dozens of stout vines, so climbing into or out of the grotto is easy and automatically successful.

The bones are the remains of Ormalagos, an adult green dragon better known during her lifetime as Needle. She used this grotto as a lair but feared Batiri goblins had sniffed out its location and were getting ready to raid it. Needle was in the process of moving her treasure to other locations when the goblins struck. While the dragon was away, they dumped baskets full of quippers into the sinkhole. When the dragon returned, they trapped her in the sinkhole with vine nets. As the quippers devoured the dragon from below, the Batiri showered Needle with spears from above until she finally died. Nearly the entire goblin tribe perished in the fight, too.

The characters' first impression of the water is correct; it varies from 3 to 4 feet deep everywhere. A search of the muddy bottom turns up hundreds of goblin bones and stone spear heads, greatly annoys the multitude of frogs, and draws attacks from two **swarms of quippers**. Someone who examines the dragon bones and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check sees enough regularity in the vines draped across the ribs to conclude the dragon was tangled in a net. To identify the remains as a green dragon, characters must lift its skull out of the water and muck; that feat takes a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Treasure
A 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-high secret door in the northwest wall of the grotto conceals a 15-foot-deep alcove. The secret door is carved from natural rock and disguised to look like part of the wall, and all the plants around it are dead. The secret door can be detected with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. Characters who inspect the plants around the door and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check can tell that the plants were killed by poison. Needle opened the secret door by breathing poison gas on it; smearing or spraying poison on the door also causes it to swing open. Otherwise, a *knock* spell or similar magic is needed to open it.

Needle hid the following items in the alcove: a purse made from triceratops hide, a small box made from two velociraptor skulls cleverly fitted together, and a hollow dinosaur bone with a wax plug at one end. The purse contains 55 gp, 800 sp, and three blue quartz rings (10 gp each). The skull box is worth 12 gp and contains a *wand of fear* and two diamonds (500 gp each). The hollow dinosaur bone contains five *+1 sling bullets*.

### Nsi Wastes
This vast tract of jungle was ravaged by blight long ago and never recovered. The plants here are sickly and poisonous. In the heart of this wasteland is the ruined palace of the warlord **Ras Nsi**: a crumbled stone fortress that once stood on the backs of a dozen giant undead turtles. Its destruction by **Ras Nsi**'s rampaging undead was so complete that nothing remains of this once-awesome structure except the crushed shells and bleached bones of the turtles, and heaps of stone so jumbled that not even the outlines of the ancient walls can be picked out, slowly sinking into the muck. The chance for a random encounter is doubled in this region.

### Omu
The lost city of Omu is described in chapter 3.

### Orolunga
All that remains of the ancient city of Orolunga is a crumbling ziggurat watched over by a **guardian naga**. The naga is thousands of years old and a font of useful information—perhaps the best source of information in Chult. However, she's not easy to reach.

>>A massive brick and stone ziggurat rises from the jungle. Two staircases angle up and across the front face, one from the right, the other from the left, to meet at a landing on the second level 30 feet above your heads. That layout repeats on the second level, and the third level, but with each successive layer adding less height than the one below it. The fourth level, 60 feet above the jungle floor, is an enclosed shrine or temple, its walls adorned with labyrinth symbols.
>>
>>The jungle encroaches right up to and onto this ancient structure. The first flights of steps are choked with creepers, tree roots, and flowering vines. It might have been surrounded by a city long ago, but the jungle is so dense that it would take hours of searching to find buried foundations and tumbled stones.
>>

The ziggurat is encased in magic, which becomes obvious if anyone casts *detect magic*. This protective shell prevents anyone from ascending the ziggurat by any means other than climbing the stairs. Characters who try to fly up rise above the trees but never get any closer to the ziggurat, as if they're flying into a powerful headwind they can't detect. Those who try to climb a wall get halfway up, then inexplicably loses their grip and slide back down. A ladder built to scale a wall never reaches the top, no matter how long the ladder. A rope-and-hook thrown up to catch the edge always falls short. Casting *teleport* or *misty step* moves the caster sideways instead of up to the next level. Bypassing the tests by any means is flat-out impossible. It might help to think of the whole situation as a fairy tale; it doesn't need to make sense, because the magic of Orolunga is on a mythic scale that overpowers the ability of any mortal.

#### First Steps
The steps from the ground to level 1 of the ziggurat are 50 feet long and rise 30 feet. A tangle of roots, vines, and creepers covers the steps. Characters can climb the first 10 feet as difficult terrain. After 10 feet, they begin getting scratched by thorns. If they continue, they take 1 slashing damage per foot climbed. After 20 feet, that increases to 2 slashing damage per foot. The thorns regrow as quickly as they're slashed, burned, or destroyed, and they can't be parted by magic or by abilities. No damage is incurred for moving down the steps.

After the characters' first attempts to climb the steps, they notice a **chwinga** (see *appendix D*) standing among them. It's about a foot tall, and its mask resembles a triceratops' head. It's also carrying a large orange and purple orchid. After a moment, it charges up the steps; the thorns part before it and close immediately behind it.

To ascend the steps, characters must find more of the orange and purple orchids. They can be found in the jungle in 30 minutes if anyone in the group has proficiency in the Nature skill, or 60 minutes otherwise. Each character climbing the stairs needs his or her own orchid.

#### Second Steps
The steps from level 1 to level 2 are 33 feet long and rise 20 feet. The stone is crumbling from age and decay. Those who try climbing the steps find that, after the first few, the stone crumbles into gravel beneath them so they can't make any more progress. However much the characters try to climb and demolish the steps, they never seem to get any worse and the gravel never piles up any deeper.

After the characters' first attempts to climb, they notice another **chwinga** standing among them at the base of the steps. Its mask resembles a chameleon's head. It's carrying an orange and purple orchid and a red parrot feather, and it races up the steps with ease, literally light as a feather on the fragile stones.

Characters can find parrot feathers in the jungle or lying around on this level after just a few minutes of searching. They need both the feather and the orchid to climb the steps.

#### Third Steps
The steps from level 2 to level 3 (the level of the shrine) are 20 feet long and rise 12 feet. The stairs are in excellent condition, but **swarms of poisonous snakes** slither over them. If snakes are killed, more crawl out through holes in the stone to replace them, so the swarms can never be destroyed or even weakened. No spells or abilities prevent the snakes from attacking someone who climbs the stairs.

After a few moments of examining the stairs, the characters notice a third **chwinga** standing among them at the base of the steps. Its mask resembles a mongoose's face, and it carries a red parrot feather and an orange and purple orchid. At the bottom step, the chwinga whacks a snake with its orchid to make it angry, then strokes the snake's flank with the feather to calm it down, then lies down facing the snake, whereupon the reptile crawls through the mouth of the mask and inside the chwinga. The chwinga then slithers up the steps like a snake, untroubled by any of the other poisonous snakes. To climb the steps safely, characters must do the same thing, but this stage isn't automatic. Using the orchid and the feather are easy, but a character must make a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw after swallowing a snake. Evil-aligned characters have disadvantage on the saving throw. If the save succeeds, the character can slither up the steps safely. If the saving throw fails, the character takes 17 (5d6) psychic damage and can try again, but the DC increases to 11. The DC increases by 1 more with each successive failure.

#### Saja N'baza's Shrine
The shrine atop the ziggurat is a simple, rectangular structure of brick. The outside walls are decorated with labyrinth symbols of Ubtao. Beyond the open doorway is a barren, dusty room, but any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher notes the aroma of incense.

Characters who enter without their orchid and feather find the shrine empty. Leaving and coming back with the items changes nothing; it's too late. Characters who enter with their orchid and feather find themselves in the same room, but as it was centuries ago. They can enter the naga's presence once. Someone who leaves and comes back in sees only the bare room.

Read the following to players whose characters find themselves in the naga's presence:

>>Hanging lamps illuminate the room, while incense burners fill it with exotic scents and curling smoke. Cushions and reed mats cover the floor, pots of blooming flowers line the plastered walls, and singing birds flit from plant to plant.
>>
>>An immense snake with iridescent scales rests on a heap of cushions opposite the doorway. It rises slowly to a height of 5 feet, staring directly into your eyes as it moves. Its face is remarkably humanlike, and its tongue flicks before it speaks.
>>
>>"I am Saja N'baza. What do you seek in this ancient place? Speak truly, for I hear your hearts!"
>>

If the characters haven't yet encountered **Artus Cimber** and **Dragonbait**, the duo might be conferring with the **guardian naga** when the party arrives. Saja N'baza knows what happened to the city of Mezro (see "Mezro") and tells Artus that it won't return as long as **Ras Nsi** lives. This gives Artus incentive to accompany the party to Omu.

The naga knows through visions that **Ras Nsi** and his yuan-ti followers are scheming to end the world from their lair in Omu. She doesn't know much about the death curse, but when characters describe it, she confirms that it fits with various omens tied to Omu. The naga knows that Omu lies between the Peaks of Flame and the Valley of Lost Honor, and she also knows it's sunken below the level of the surrounding jungle, so the best way to spot it will be from the air or from the nearest high ground.

The naga remembers **Ras Nsi**'s first uprising, and she urges the characters to kill him both as punishment for his past atrocities and to prevent any possibility of a recurrence. Each character who agrees receives a supernatural charm (see *chapter 7* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) to aid their task. Assign charms to characters that are appropriate to their roles in the party. Characters who seem reluctant might have *geas* cast on them.

#### Leaving the Shrine
After characters leave the shrine, nothing they do brings them back to Saja N'baza's presence. The shrine is a barren chamber every time they reenter. It's dawn of the next day, no matter what time it was when they entered. They can descend the ziggurat with no difficulty, with or without the orchid and feather; the snakes are gone, the steps are solid, and a clear path extends through the plants and thorns. When they reach the ground, characters see blue tulips blooming all around the base of the ziggurat. The tulips are beautiful but nonmagical.

### Port Castigliar
Port Castigliar (pronounced kah-STEE-lee-ar) is a port in name only. In fact, it's nothing more than a stretch of beach with an abandoned supply depot, seven battered huts made of bamboo and thatch, and a defiled graveyard. Undead drove away the inhabitants long ago, and ghouls dug up the graves.

### Refuge Bay
Refuge Bay has a reputation for being a relatively safe place to make landfall. Many explorations of Chult have begun on its white sand beach, which stretches as far as the eye can see around the entire shore of the bay. A Chultan town called Ishau once stood at the head of the bay, but its foundations sank into the sea during the Spellplague. The town's buildings are still largely intact but they now lie more than a mile from dry land, and they're prowled by sharks, plesiosaurs, and sea hags.

### River Olung
Steaming-hot water from Lake Luo cools quickly as it tumbles down rapids and low cataracts. This river is recognized by guides and explorers as an important boundary. To the east is "normal" jungle; to the west is undead territory. For this reason alone, some expeditions choose to enter the peninsula through Refuge Bay.

### River Soshenstar
The Soshenstar flows north from the Aldani Basin to the Bay of Chult, tumbling down waterfalls every ten to fifteen miles.

### River Tath
This river springs from the Aldani Basin and meanders westward, passing over waterfalls and through the canyon of Ataaz Kahakla before washing into Jahaka Bay.

### River Tiryki
The Tiryki spills from the back of a mist-shrouded canyon and flows north toward the Bay of Chult, plunging over waterfalls every few miles. This makes it arduous to traverse by canoe upriver—everything must be laboriously portaged around the cataracts—and dangerous to travel downriver, lest a canoe gets caught in the current and swept over a waterfall or smashed in rapids. What's worse, jungle predators and undead prowl both riverbanks. Considering the pterafolk nesting at Firefinger and the grungs living above the gorge, it's easy to see why the Tiryki is considered the most dangerous river in Chult.

### Shilku
This abandoned coastal village was both destroyed and preserved by volcanic eruption. The silent streets are buried in ash, and the harbor is choked with cooled lava. Since Mezro is now largely "cleared out," **Liara Portyr** of Fort Beluarian is under pressure from her patrons in Baldur's Gate to begin exploring and excavating Shilku for the treasures that are undoubtedly entombed there. Such an undertaking would require building a new fort from scratch somewhere on the southwestern coast, and Liara has neither the hands nor the funds for that. She might try to enlist the player characters into making a voyage to scout possible locations for such a fort, if only so she can reassure her impatient superiors in Baldur's Gate that progress is being made.

Although devoid of human life, the city is far from dead. Mephits, firenewts, salamanders, and other heat-loving creatures prowl its ashen alleys and bore tunnels into cellars long sealed by volcanic stone.

### Shilku Bay
Lava still erupts from the volcano that destroyed Shilku, and it flows like a glowing river down into this bay. The sulfurous water is poisonous, so most of the bay's sea life is dead and the surrounding shore is barren. Safe landing spots can still be found on the beaches along the western shore, but a sailing ship that cruises along the eastern shore near Shilku is likely to lose its sails—and possibly much more—to the red-hot stones that infrequently rain down from the sky or to the burning ash that drifts miles out into the bay before finally extinguishing itself in the stinking, hissing water.

### Snapping Turtle Bay
This bay is beautiful beyond compare. Though the sky is dark with clouds of smoke and ash streaked with lightning, the white sand beaches, lush forests, bright coral reefs, and colorful wildlife make this a restful retreat from the horrors of Chult. The shore is not without its dangers, but even they are inviting and wondrous to behold. Tri-flower fronds, mantraps, and jaculis are common, as are the fierce and aggressive giant snapping turtles that give the bay its name. See *appendix D* for more information on these creatures.

Cyclopes roam the shore and lair in mountain caves overlooking the bay. These simple creatures aren't inherently hostile, but they are suspicious and wary around newcomers. Any show of malicious intent on the part of strangers is enough to shift the cyclopes from cautious to hostile. They are experts at surviving the dangers of Snapping Turtle Bay, which makes them valuable allies if characters offer them something they want. The cyclopes always need metal tools (shortswords make dandy daggers), and they're delighted by whimsical magical trinkets. For generous inducements, cyclopes could even be hired to serve as bearers, guards, or guides for an expedition headed north into the immense jungle between the Peaks of Flame and the Valley of Dread.

#### King Toba
A **giant snapping turtle** (see *appendix D*) of unusual size (120 hit points) likes to sun itself on the beaches during the day. Chultans refer to the beast as King Toba. Residual magic from the Spellplague has crystallized parts of its shell. The shell's magic grants King Toba advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Treasure.*** If the mighty turtle is defeated, sixty crystals can be broken off its shell and sold for 10 gp each.

### Snout of Omgar
Once a mountainous peninsula, the Snout of Omgar was split apart by the sea during the upheaval of the Spellplague. A narrow strait allows passage between the mainland and what is now a large island. Mariners and cartographers consider this feature to mark the boundary between the shores of Chult and the shores of Samarach.

### Valley of Dread
Explorers entering Chult from the east are likely to trek through this passage, which is contained by the windworn Sky Lizard Mountains to the north and the jagged Sanrach Mountains to the south. The valley of dense jungle is well named; it's a stomping ground for dinosaurs of all kinds. It's also home to savage kingdoms of lizardfolk ruled by heartless lizard kings and queens.

### Valley of Embers
This burned-out valley surrounds Lake Luo. Most of the vegetation around the southern and eastern shore of the lake has been wiped out by pyroclastic flows, rivers of lava, and drifting ash. Fiery embers belched from the Peaks of Flame drift across the sky and fall like rain onto a blackened wasteland. The marshland north of the lake is wet enough to survive, but the accumulation of ash atop the water has turned into an almost impassable expanse of knee-deep muck. Mud mephits and steam mephits abound.

### Valley of Lost Honor
The undead hordes of **Ras Nsi** wiped out a tribe of Chultans in this valley. The bones of the fallen Eshowe are gone, along with everything else—swallowed up by lava pouring out of the volcano west of Hrakhamar. Firenewts have taken over that old dwarven forge in the mountains, and their territorial claim extends the entire length of this valley. Firenewt warriors mounted on giant striders (see *appendix D*) enforce that claim, making the valley very dangerous for interlopers. Tzindelor, the young red dragon inhabiting Wyrmheart Mine, is the only creature whose might and authority the firenewts begrudgingly respect. Tzindelor and the firenewts leave each other alone for now, but both of them covet what the other has: Tzindelor would like to possess Hrakhamar, and the firenewts would profit from controlling the iron resources in Wyrmheart Mine.

### Vorn

>>Standing next to some rocks and ferns is an 8-foot-tall statue, humanoid in shape with bronze fists, iron joints, an adamantine breastplate, and an iron helm with slits for eyes. The rest of the statue is made of sculpted wood reinforced with bands and rivets of adamantine. Scattered around its feet are offerings of food, feathers, colored stones, and skulls.
>>

The statue is actually a deactivated **shield guardian** that once served as a wizard's bodyguard. The wizard died from extreme bad luck decades ago—he fell out of a tree during a particularly bad bout of blue mist fever, hit his head on a rock that knocked him unconscious, and rolled into a puddle, where he drowned. The shield guardian has stood impassive and unmoving, awaiting orders, ever since. A character with proficiency in the Arcana skill recognizes the shield guardian for what it is with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

A character who searches the area and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check finds footprints in the dirt—evidence of nomadic tribes of goblins, grungs, and vegepygmies that revere the construct as a lesser god. They trim back the jungle vines and creepers that would otherwise swallow the construct, and they leave offerings at its feet. The area around it for several miles is a "neutral zone" where these tribes allow each other to enter without triggering conflict.

Anyone who finds the shield guardian's control amulet (see "Yellyark") can animate the construct and take control of it. Reactivating the construct and marching it away infuriates local goblin, grung, and vegepygmy tribes. Random encounters with such creatures are automatically hostile unless characters placate the tribes with treasure or convince them of Vorn's "wish" to be moved elsewhere.

### Wreck of the Narwhal
Through some magical mishap, a seafaring galleon called the *Narwhal* ended up in the heart of the jungle. It lies upside down, its hull encrusted with barnacles and overgrown with ivy. The crew is gone without a trace, but the old ship still has occupants: a reclusive weretiger and a small tribe of vegepygmies share it. Since the weretiger kills more than he eats and leaves the surplus for the vegepygmies, the tiny community gets along fine. The vegepygmies thrive in the damp, dark area under the ship and in its hold, while the weretiger lives more elegantly in the airy, well-furnished (albeit upside down) captain's cabin.

The vegepygmy tribe consists of a **vegepygmy chief**, twelve **vegepygmies**, and three **thornies** (see *appendix D* for the vegepygmies' and thornies' statistics). The **weretiger** (N male Chultan human) uses no name anymore, but he was called Bwayes O'tamu years ago. He is a cousin of **Wakanga O'tamu** (see "Merchant Princes" ), and the two were quite close as children. The family resemblance is strong; characters who've met Wakanga see the similarity when the weretiger assumes human form. The weretiger speaks Common and Vegepygmy, though he's forgotten much of the former through disuse.

When characters enter the same hex as the *Narwhal*, roll any die. On an odd result, Bwayes is out hunting and automatically detects the characters' presence before they're aware of him; on an even result, Bwayes is resting at the hulk, meaning characters are likely to encounter the vegepygmies before the weretiger. If Bwayes detects the characters, he tracks them covertly, out of curiosity rather than bloodlust. He'd like to meet them and find out what they're after. He'll even bring them back to the ship and trade gems for wine, if they have any. Unless the characters are accompanied by Bwayes, the vegepygmies are hostile toward them.

If the characters befriend the weretiger and inquire about other places in Chult, he shares the following information:

- The bones of a great dragon lie in a grotto to the southwest. (Bwayes can lead characters to Needle's Bones if they ask him nicely.)
- Between the River Olung and the Nsi Wastes lie the ruins of a once-beautiful garden palace said to contain treasure beyond compare. (Bwayes can lead the characters to Nangalore but won't explore it out of respect.)

#### Treasure
The weretiger's cabin contains enough scavenged gear to create a set of cartographer's tools and a set of leatherworker's tools, as well as an herbalism kit. A battered wooden trunk near the weretiger's hammock holds an explorer's pack, a spyglass, a set of Three-Dragon Ante cards (the weretiger doesn't know how to play), a leather pouch containing four assorted gemstones (100 gp each), and two *potions of healing*.

### Wreck of the Star Goddess

>>A wooden vessel is caught high in the tree branches, broken into three chunks. It resembles a ship, but there are differences that mark it clearly as not a seagoing vessel. The stern is the lowest piece, hanging precariously by its rigging about 50 feet above ground. The middle section appears to be 15 feet higher, and the bow section is firmly wedged into a nest of branches another 10 feet above that.
>>
>>A weak voice calls out, "Hallo, on the ground. Can you help us?"
>>

The *Star Goddess* was a 90-foot skyship from Halruaa. It flew like a blimp, with the aid of an amazing lighter-than-air gasbag. A crew of Halruaan adventurers was using it to explore Chult from the air when it was attacked by a flock of pterafolk. The pterafolk slashed the airbag, and the vessel crashed into the jungle canopy. As shown in map 2.13, the wooden gondola broke into three pieces, which now hang precariously in the treetops at three different heights. The deflated balloon is tangled in the branches above. The crash could have occurred anytime within the past 3d10 days.

Climbing up to the wreck is relatively easy, thanks to many vines in the trees and lines of rigging hanging from the ship. A successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check is enough to reach the ship from the ground. The same check must be repeated to move from one section of the ship to another; alternatively, a character can jump down from a higher to a lower section with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

#### Crash Survivors
The voice calling to the party belongs to Thasselandra Bravewing, the ship's captain (NG female Halruaan human **noble**). She explains the situation briefly before she weakens and her voice becomes too soft to hear from the ground. The other crash survivors include the ship's navigator, Ra-das (N male Halruaan human **scout**); the master-of-arms, Falx Haranis (CN male Halruaan human **veteran**); and three other crewmen named Brax, Nhar, and Veliod (N male Halruaan human **guards**). Ra-das and Falx are in the stern section; the other NPCs are all in the midsection.

The ship was carrying supplies, but most of the cargo spilled to the ground when the gondola broke apart. The survivors can catch rainwater in buckets, but they've been without food for several days. As a result, all the NPCs have 4 levels of exhaustion (see appendix A of the *Player's Handbook* for effects) and are not strong enough to climb to the ground on their own.

![[045-0320.webp|right|300]]

#### Undead Scavengers
When characters first arrive on the scene, they see eight **ghouls** lurking in the foliage below the wreck. Each ghoul has a small blue triangle tattooed on its forehead—the symbol of **Ras Nsi**. The ghouls have three-quarters cover from trees, and they withdraw from the area temporarily if the situation gets too hot.

A few minutes after characters climb up to the wreck, it's attacked by three **girallon zombies** (see *appendix D*). The monsters approach from the east, and because they have a climbing speed, they can move anywhere on the map as easily as on the ship. The NPCs fight back, but they aren't very effective given their exhaustion. The girallon zombies aren't above grabbing enemies and tossing them off the ship; one or two of the NPC guards should die that way. A character who falls or is thrown off the ship can halve the falling damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, representing clutching at vines and branches on the way down.

#### Treasure
There is no treasure aboard the *Star Goddess* or amid the debris under it, but characters can salvage weapons, clothing, and enough supplies to assemble one explorer's pack and one priest's pack.

### Wyrmheart Mine
A clan of shield dwarves operated this iron mine (map 2.14) up until forty years ago, when it was conquered by a young red dragon named Tzindelor. **Hew Hackinstone** (see "Finding a Guide") hopes to reclaim and reopen the mine, and he gladly enlists the characters to his aid (or ropes them in unwillingly, if he must).

Tzindelor has amassed a following of kobolds, who call her Tinder. She occasionally leaves to hunt but spends most of her time sleeping at the bottom of the mine. The kobolds rig their shared lair with numerous traps. Many parts of the mine still show signs of the dwarves' battle against Tinder, including the scattered and charred bones of those who died.

The dwarves left three ore carts in the mine, all in working order or repairable. The cart track circling the main shaft is quite steep; not as steep as stairs, but steeper than most ramps. The ore carts are built so that the downhill end (the front) is higher than the uphill end (the back). This allows them to sit level on the sloping track, but they look odd on level ground. A heavy draw rope and harness are hooked to the back of each cart so that a trained dinosaur could pull the heavy load up the track. A stout, lever-operated brake controls its descent.

Carts can be shunted onto the side passages if the tracks are switched using a crowbar (one is stashed near each siding). When characters arrive, the tracks are set to bypass all the sidings and run straight through to the bottom.

Some carts' brakes are in better condition than others. If a brake fails, the cart races out of control round and round the pit until it smashes into the barrier at the bottom of the track. Everyone in the cart when it hits takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 20 vertical feet the cart descended. Those who bail out before the cart hits takes half damage, based on how far the cart descended before they jumped, but each creature must also succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or tumble over the edge of the track and plunge to the bottom of the shaft.

![[047-0321a.webp|right|300]]
#### 1. Office

>>This building has walls made of closely fitted stone with large windows, and a wide, overhanging tile roof. It's now overgrown with vines and creepers, but the structure is still solid.
>>

The door is swollen shut and must be forced open with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, but the windows can be climbed through easily. Startled lizards and birds flee through the windows when anyone enters.

The building's contents have all rotted. Ledgers mildewed into slime long ago. Tables and cabinets are covered with creepers, bird droppings, and the bones of small animals. Stools collapse if any weight is put on them. There's no information and nothing of use here.

#### 2. Supply Shed

>>This building is made from closely fitted stones and has a tile roof, but no windows. Portions of the wall are crumbling where tree roots are pushing the stones apart. Gouges and scars show where someone tried to hack through the heavy door with axes but gave up after making little headway.
>>

The axe marks are only a few feet off the ground (having been made by kobolds). The door can be forced open with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

Dozens of crates and barrels are stacked inside. Several have been toppled over by tree roots growing beneath them. Stored food and water is inedible, but the other supplies are mostly still usable, even if they won't be especially useful to adventurers. They consist of tools for mining, stone-working, and iron-working, shovels, lanterns and candles, miners' helmets, heavy gloves, spare wheels, axles, and brakes for ore carts, grease, thick rope, tar, brushes, brooms, and so forth.

#### 3. Ore Cart

>>An ore cart sits on the tracks at the entrance to the mine, held in place by a block under the wheels.
>>

The cart's metal box is still solid, but one of the axles is broken and the other screeches horribly. The supply shed (area 3) contains the parts and grease to get it rolling again. The old brake looks solid, but each time it's used, it has a 10 percent chance to fail utterly. This risk is recognized by someone who inspects the brake and makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. The brake can be repaired with spare parts from the supply shed.

#### 4. Upper Shaft
Inside the mine, the cave opens into an enormous, 250-foot-deep pit. The dwarves left a stout stone column in the middle to support the roof, and they built a wooden walkway to span the pit from south to north. Despite many broken or missing planks, the walkway is fundamentally solid. Tracks for the ore carts descend around the walls of the pit in a clockwise fashion. Enough daylight filters through the mine opening to create dim illumination to the bottom of the shaft.

The kobolds living in the mine believe (correctly) that this upper level is haunted by dwarven spirits. The kobolds avoid the upper level of the mine except when they must exit or enter. They use the wooden bridge exclusively and never walk along the cart track past area 5.

#### 5. Haunted Forge
This was the dwarves' forge and workshop. Many of the miners retreated here when Tinder attacked, but the dragon incinerated their barricades and then burned them out with her breath. The entire area from the bottom of the steps to the backs of the chambers is scorched and black. A dozen or more (it's difficult to sort them out) charred skeletons litter the chambers. One dwarf skeleton is more recent than the others (the body has been dead for three years) and not charred; it lies near the base of the steps, in a face-down, head-down position that implies the dwarf died while scrambling down the steps. This was a member of **Hew Hackinstone's** expedition who fell victim to the haunted forge.

Six **specters** haunt the forge, three in each chamber. They are all that's left of the mine's dwarven defenders. The first character to enter either chamber is attacked by the specters in that chamber, and those from the adjoining chamber arrive 2 rounds later. The specters can't leave the forge.

***Treasure.*** Most of the dwarves' possessions were burned or melted by dragon fire, but one skeleton wears a *mithral breastplate* that survived the flames.

#### 6A. Ledge
This platform is lit by a torch in a wall sconce and guarded by two **kobold inventors** (see *appendix D*). Rough-hewn steps descend to area 6B.

#### 6B. Egg Nursery

>>Seven small reptilian humanoids guard this room, the walls of which have niches carved into them. Each niche is lined with moss and holds a brown egg the size of a small orange.
>>

Seven **kobolds** guard this room, which serves as the kobolds' egg nursery. These kobolds protect their eggs with flinty resolve. The mossy niches in the walls contain a total of thirty eggs.

#### 6C. Rolling Stone Trap
A tripwire stretches across the mouth of the tunnel where the lower passage joins the cart track. It can be spotted with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the tripwire is missed, each character who passes through the tunnel mouth has a 50 percent chance to trip it and trigger two mechanisms. The first mechanism is a spring-loaded wooden contraption resembling a claw that swings out from the wall of the mine shaft up-slope from this tunnel to snap across the tunnel mouth. Whoever triggered the trap must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the claw. One round later, the second mechanism releases a 5-foot-diameter stone sphere that drops into the cave (marked T on the map) and rolls into the wooden claw across the tunnel mouth, which is demolished by the sphere's impact—but not before diverting the sphere onto the cart tracks. The sphere careens down the tracks until it reaches area 11, where it derails and smashes into the urds' living quarters. (The urds easily hear it coming and get out of the way.) Everyone in the sphere's path must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Instead of being hit by the sphere, a character who fails the saving throw can opt to leap off the tracks and fall to the bottom of the shaft; this succeeds automatically. The sphere can't be slowed down by Strength checks because of the steep incline of the tracks.

#### 7. Upper Landing
Two **kobolds** stand guard near some old crates. One keeps an eye on the cart track, while the other watches the stairs to the south. If one kobold falls, the other flees down the stairs to warn its kin in area 8.

***Ore Cart.*** The ore cart north of this area appears to be in working condition, though its brakes have a 10 percent chance to fail each time they're used.

#### 8. Main Living Quarters
The north passage connecting this chamber to the cart track is trapped with a swinging log studded with spikes. A character moving through the passage has a 50 percent chance to trip the trigger wire, which can be spotted with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each creature in the passage when the log swings through must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) piercing damage and be knocked prone.

>>A fire smolders in a pit in the middle of the chamber, with lizards, bats, and quippers slowly roasting on sticks propped around it. The fire illuminates the cave's kobold occupants.
>>

During daytime, this room contains 2d6 **kobolds**; at night, that number swells to 6d6 **kobolds**. Day or night, half of the occupants are noncombatants. Unless some loud disturbance has awakened them, the kobolds sleep piled atop one another on mounds of reeds that are infested with small lizards and other vermin.

***Shrine.*** The chamber to the east is a shrine to Kurtulmak. It contains two empty barrels, atop one of which is a 3-foot-tall statue of the kobold deity assembled from bits of metal, glass, wood, and stone. Offerings of food are piled around the base. None of the statue's components are valuable, but it would be worth 10 gp to any curio collector in Port Nyanzaru. The statue weighs 15 pounds. Other than the statue of Kurtulmak, there is no treasure. Everything the kobolds find of value is surrendered to Tinder.

#### 9. Inventors' Quarters
Old crates and barrels have been converted into sleeping hovels for the tribe's **kobold inventors**, two of which are present (see *appendix D*). The other two are in area 6A.

#### 10. Big Smash
A boulder is precariously balanced on a ledge above the cart track at this point. A rope tied round the boulder passes through an iron ring on the central pillar and through another near the kobolds' chambers. If the kobolds hear an ore cart rumbling down the tracks, four of them race out and prepare to yank this rope, timing it so the boulder smashes down on the cart. They make an attack roll (+4 to hit) against the cart's AC, which depends on its speed. Rolling at top speed (no brakes), the cart has AC 16. If occupants are using the brakes to control its speed, the cart has AC 8. If the cart's occupants engage or release the brake when they see the kobolds pulling the rope, to change the cart's speed, it has AC 12.

If the boulder hits, every creature in the cart takes 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage. Roll a d6 to determine what happens to the cart and its occupants:

>- **1–2**. The cart continues down the track unhindered.
>- **3–5**. The cart derails into area 11. Each creature in the cart is thrown out, lands prone, and must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage.
>- **6**. The cart tumbles off the track and falls 125 feet to area 12. A creature in the cart can make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to leap out before the cart goes over the edge and falls. On a successful save, the creature lands prone on the cart track. On a failed save, the creature goes over the edge with the cart and takes damage from the fall, as normal.

#### 11. Urds' Quarters
Once used as a secondary work and storage area for the dwarven miners, this cave now serves as living quarters for eight urds (**winged kobolds**). The urds don't mingle with their wingless kin and attack intruders on sight, fleeing up the shaft if half or more of them are killed.

***Ore Cart.*** The ore cart on the siding below this area appears to be in working order, but the brake handle will snap off the first time it's used.

#### 12. Bottom of the Shaft

>>The floor at the bottom of the shaft is littered with charred dwarven skeletons. A 60-foot-high waterfall pours out of the north wall, forming a large pool about 10 feet deep. All you can hear is the sound of crashing water.
>>

A dozen charred dwarven skeletons litter the floor. Eight of them are ancient and covered with calcium deposits, but four are fresher (they're from **Hew Hackinstone**'s ill-fated expedition three years ago). The kobolds stripped them of anything valuable.

An underground stream pours out of the north wall 35 feet above the cart track (60 feet above the floor) and plunges through the trestle before splashing into a pool on the mine floor. It's only a thin curtain of water, but it makes a lot of noise and it raises enough mist to keep the bottom of the shaft perpetually damp. The pool is home to 2d6 **quippers**. A fishing net is rolled up nearby.

***Passage to Hrakhamar.*** An elevated cart track enters a tunnel in the north wall and continues northward (more or less) for 40 miles to the firenewt-infested smelter and forge of Hrakhamar. It's passable and the tracks are intact for the full length, but encounters with **kobolds** and other monsters are likely.

#### 13. Audience Chamber

>>This cave looks out over a much larger cave. Hanging from pegs at the back of the overlook are four ferocious-looking wooden masks and four capes made of scaly dinosaur hide dyed bright red.
>>

When the kobolds have tribute for Tinder or need the dragon's advice or approval, they send their fawning, groveling emissaries to this ledge overlooking the dragon's lair. The kobolds don the ceremonial wooden masks and capes before addressing their overlord.

If characters put on the masks and capes before peering into area 14, and they make themselves seem kobold-sized, they have a chance to fool the dragon into believing they're kobolds, but it's easy to slip up. First, the kobolds speak only Draconic to the dragon. Second, they fill their speech with flattery and overblown honorifics such as "your titanic, blazing majesty" and "thou unquenchable, unendurable furnace." Third, they never, ever question the dragon's proclamations or judgments. Whenever one of these precepts is broken, Tinder can make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the characters' Charisma (Deception) checks to see through the ruse. If additional characters are hiding on the overlook during a conversation with the dragon, each must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity (Stealth) check (with advantage if they're completely out of sight from area 14) to evade notice.

#### 14. Tinder's Lair
Tzindelor, a female **young red dragon** better known as Tinder, spends most of her time here, dozing atop her treasure hoard. Otherwise, she's out hunting and terrorizing her neighbors. Characters have improved chances to sneak up on her from area 12, thanks to the loud waterfall there (either they have advantage on Stealth checks or Tinder has disadvantage on Perception checks, whichever is more appropriate to the situation). The dragon can't be surprised if kobolds triggered the boulder trap in area 10, and she can't miss the sound of an ore cart rolling down the tracks or a loud spell going off anywhere in the complex.

The dragon is inclined to kill anyone she doesn't recognize but might converse with adventurers who have something interesting to say. Being young, she still has much to learn about the world. If flattered and offered a sufficient bribe (offerings worth at least 500 gp), she can even provide basic directions to any landmark within 100 miles of Wyrmheart Mine.

The dragon doesn't hold back when it comes to using her breath weapon; she loves watching her prey scream and burn in the flames. In a desperate situation, she's confident she can fly up the mine shaft and escape faster than any intruders can pursue.

***Treasure.*** The dragon's hoard contains 3,300 gp, 15,000 sp, 45,000 cp, a gold-embroidered scabbard (25 gp), a dragon-shaped medal and chain fashioned from gold (50 gp), a copper mug with jade inlay (100 gp), and a *potion of greater healing*.

Old crates and barrels near the south wall contain 1d12 each of dwarf-made breastplates, helmets, shields, warhammers, and battleaxes. One of the dwarf-made battleaxes is actually a *+1 battleaxe* that floats on water and other liquids, and grants its bearer advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to swim. Etched into the haft of the battleaxe are Dethek (Dwarvish) runes that spell the weapon's name: Bob.

### Yellyark
Yellyark (map 2.15) is home to the Biting Ant tribe of Batiri goblins. These goblins wear stylized wooden ant masks and mark the perimeter of their territory with the heads and skulls of their enemies (humanoids and beasts). In this context, "territory" refers to a single hex on **Syndra Silvane**'s map.

To protect themselves against giant carnivores, the goblins built the important structures of the village atop a "net" of strong, supple tree branches bound together with vines. The net is rigged to a heavy tree, bent down like a giant spring. When a predator threatens to overrun the village, goblins cut the vine and the entire village is rolled into a ball and flung a thousand yards over the jungle! The huts inside are cushioned from impact by layers of leaves and moss; damage to the flexible structures can be repaired, and most of the village's precious totems, food, basketwork, and spare weapons are saved.

![[048-0322.webp|right|300]]

Forty goblins live in the village: Queen **Grabstab** (a **goblin boss**), twenty-four adult **goblins**, and fifteen noncombatant children. For more information on Batiri goblins and their tactics, see "Races of Chult."

The tribe's survival depends on getting an early warning of approaching danger, so sentries are always posted around the village. They wear ponchos made of vines and leaves, which give them advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while remaining perfectly still, but impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks when they move. The sentries also ring the village with tripwires attached to shells and skulls filled with pebbles. Characters who search for such things while approaching the village notice the tripwires with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check; otherwise, they're noticed by anyone with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher. If approaching enemies are noticed by sentries or trigger a tripwire, the village goes on alert, making it impossible to sneak in.

![[050-0323a.webp|right|300]]
#### 1. Canoes
Three canoes are pulled up on the bank of the stream.

#### 2. Larder
The goblins store fresh meat, fish, and other perishable food in this hut. It doesn't get launched with the rest of the village; in case of attack, this food is left behind to keep carnivores occupied while the goblins escape.

#### 3. Queen Grabstab's Hut
The queen's hut is no larger than the others, but two **goblins** always stand guard outside. Queen **Grabstab** (a **goblin boss**) and four more **goblins** (her adult children and attendants) are inside, bickering with one another over matters that concern only them. One of the queen's attendants proudly wears the key to the wooden cage (area 4) on a loop of rope around its neck.

***Treasure.*** The queen wears a bronze and adamantine medallion that has the word "Vorn" etched into it. This is the control amulet for a shield guardian (see "Vorn"). None of the goblins have any notion the amulet is related to the object they venerate as a minor deity.

#### 4. Wooden Cage
This lashed-together bamboo cage can hold animals or prisoners, as the situation demands. Prisoners are seldom ransomed, since the Batiri have no use for coin. Usually, they're kept here until the goblins are ready to eat them. One of the goblins in area 3 carries the key to the cage's crude padlock. A character with thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 11 Dexterity check. The check is made with disadvantage if the character is trying to pick the lock from inside the cage.

#### 5. Ant Hills
This particular Batiri tribe is skilled at ant husbandry, and the village is situated between three ant hills that are each 10 feet across at the base and stand 8 feet high. The three ant hills are joined together by tunnels.

Damaging or destroying an ant hill causes six ant swarms (**swarms of insects**) to erupt from an underground nest. Two ant swarms emerge from each hill. The ants ignore the Batiri goblins and go after anything else they detect nearby.

#### 6. Launch Mechanism
The bent-down tree that launches the village is anchored at this point. The launch is triggered by cutting the thick vine, which has AC 15, 15 hit points, vulnerability to slashing damage, resistance to fire and piercing damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, psychic, and thunder damage. The entire mechanism is well camouflaged to prevent intruders from sneaking in and launching the village as a surprise attack. A character who gets a good look at the village in daylight and succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the network of vines and the bent tree and recognizes them as a gigantic spring trap. Those with proficiency in the Survival skill have advantage on this check.

Goblins don't launch themselves in this contraption; it's too deadly. Anyone inside the net when the village is launched and hits the ground must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

# Chapter 3: Dwellers of the Forbidden City
![[051-301.webp|right|300]]

Omu lies in a basin hidden in the depths of the rainforest, surrounded on all sides by sheer cliffs. The city is notoriously hard to find. Those who try must contend with miles of trackless jungle inhabited by natural predators, cannibals, and the remnants of **Ras Nsi**'s undead army. Even skilled guides have difficulty threading their way through.

To enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods, adventurers must tread cautiously, contend with the dwellers of the ruined city, and learn all they can about the nine trickster gods of Omu and their ancient rivalries.

## Omu
To the untrained eye, Omu appears abandoned, yet its raised streets and splintered plazas are far from uninhabited. If the characters reach a point where they can see the city in its entirety, either by flying above it or by looking down on it from a cliff's edge, give the players a copy of handout 12 in *appendix E*.

### Approaching the City
Two main routes lead into Omu. To the northeast, a river snakes down from the foothills of the Peaks of Flame and flushes into the city through a canyon (see area 17). The second access point is a staircase to the southwest (see area 1).

### Entering the City
When the characters see Omu for the first time, read:

>>The jungle parts to reveal a dead city enclosed by sheer cliffs. Ruined buildings and stone boulevards rise like ghosts from the floor of the misty basin. Colorful birds glide overhead.
>>
>>A waterfall pours into the basin, creating a swollen river that floods much of the city before draining into a deep rift filled with molten lava. A ruined palace lies a few hundred feet from the edge of the steaming abyss.
>>

The cliffs surrounding Omu are 100–150 feet high and composed of crumbling rock. Thick jungle hugs the clifftops, with ferns, orchids, and moss spilling over the edges. Every 100 feet or so, a **gargoyle** perches on the brink of the precipice. When a character gets a good look at one of these creatures, read:

>>A vine-draped gargoyle perches on the clifftop, staring down at the ruined city. It has the face of a devil, with its mouth agape in a silent scream.
>>

The gargoyles attack anyone who flies over the city or tries to climb up or down the cliffs, but they ignore intruders who enter by the river or the ravine to the southwest. They serve **Acererak** and take orders from his undead tomb custodian, **Withers** (see chapter 5).

### History of Omu
The tragic history of Omu is written in its ruins. As the characters explore, use the information provided here to bring the city to life.

#### Forbidden City
Omu was once a jewel in Chult's crown. Built over rich mineral veins, the city garnered wealth in abundance. Omuan jewelry was coveted far and wide, and the city's merchants grew fat on commerce. To enter Omu, it was said, was to enter the gates of paradise itself. Such wealth brought greed. Omu's hunger for slaves made her rulers demand ever greater tribute from their neighbors. When their vassals couldn't pay in flesh, they paid in blood. Omu's feared legions marched across Chult.

The Omuans' greed and hubris angered the god Ubtao, causing him to turn his back on Omu two hundred years ago—long before he abandoned the rest of Chult. Omu's clerics lost their spells, and the city fell to sickness and disease. Slave uprisings wracked Omu, and its nobles fled in droves. Maps showing Omu's location were destroyed, and its coins were melted down and reminted. Fallen from grace, Omu became known as the Forbidden City.

#### Nine Trickster Gods
With Ubtao gone, primal spirits arose from the rainforest to bewitch the few remaining Omuans. They disguised themselves as jungle creatures and promised great power in return for devotion. Desperate for redemption, the Omuans tore down their temple to Ubtao and raised shrines to these nine trickster gods.

The new deities were divisive and often cruel. Too weak to grant miracles to every follower, they concocted elaborate trials to winnow the clergy. On holy days, the mettle of aspirant priests was tested in their nine shrines, with deadly consequences for failure. The trials provided entertainment for the degenerate Omuans and fed their weakling gods with much-needed sacrifices.

For nine decades, the city folk lived by the mantras of their trickster gods. They built statues in their names and schemed against each other to assert their chosen god's dominance. Omu's glorious past was lost, but its people endured. Such mercy did not last long.

#### Fall of Omu
Omu's bloody trials drew the attention of **Acererak**, an archlich who wanders the cosmos in search of souls to harvest. **Acererak**, who is fond of deathtraps, marveled at the trials concocted by the Omuans. They inspired him to create his own dungeon below the city.

A little over a century ago, **Acererak** entered Omu and slew all nine trickster gods. He then enslaved the Omuans and forced them to carve out a tomb for their defeated gods. When the tomb was complete, **Acererak** murdered the Omuans and sealed them in the tomb with their false gods. The archlich resumed his odyssey across the planes, content that the dungeon would feed his phylactery with the souls of dead adventurers. The jungle reclaimed Omu, and it fell into ruin.

#### Rise of Ras Nsi
Fifty years ago, a brood of yuan-ti from Hisari (see chapter 2) slithered into Omu and made it their new home. They built an underground temple beneath the old palace and patiently waited for their god, Dendar the Night Serpent, to come forth and swallow the world. Earthquakes shook Omu and cracked it open like a fig, causing the river to burst its banks. Chance spared the yuan-ti temple from destruction, but scores of yuan-ti died, including their leader (a yuan-ti abomination).

The evil warlord **Ras Nsi**, who had raised an army of undead to wage war on the holy city of Mezro, only to suffer a terrible defeat, arrived in Omu shortly after the yuan-ti. **Ras Nsi** wormed his way into the yuan-ti's favor and underwent a ritual to transform into a malison. Before long, he became their ruler. Today, beneath the cracked and broken streets of Omu, **Ras Nsi** holds sway and plots to bring Dendar the Night Serpent into the world, sealing its doom.

### Legend of the Nine Gods
Stories of Omu's nine trickster gods died with the Omuans who worshiped them. As characters explore the gods' shrines, the players piece together fragments of the following legend, which provides clues on how to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

Long ago, the god Ubtao hardened his heart and vowed to weep for the people of Omu no longer. The rains stopped, the jungle withered and died, and death swept through Omu.

One morning, a wise zorbo emerged from her hollow tree and spoke to the dying Omuans. To convince Ubtao of their worth, she decided to cook him a stew made from all their good qualities. Catching such virtues wouldn't be easy, so she asked a wily almiraj to help her. The almiraj snuck recklessness in the pot, which she saw as a virtue, and Ubtao spat out the stew when he tasted it. From that day on, Obo'laka the zorbo and I'jin the almiraj became terrible enemies.

At noon, a brave kamadan hopped down from her rock. She saw the evil in the Omuans' hearts and decided to lance it like a troublesome boil. The kamadan fashioned a holy spear, but she left it by the riverbank and a crafty grung stole it. In her rage, Shagambi the kamadan forgot all about the Omuans and chased Nangnang the grung forever across the sky.

When evening came, a wily eblis stepped from his reed hut. He didn't like the Omuans, but without them he'd have no one to play his tricks on. The eblis sent a marsh frog to reason with Ubtao, but the frog was angry and decided to wrestle the god instead. This amused Ubtao, so he gave the frog tentacles to make it stronger. When Kubazan the froghemoth returned to Papazotl the eblis, he chased Papazotl into the swamp with his new tentacles.

That night, a su-monster broke into Ubtao's palace and stole a pail of water for the Omuans. When the god came running to find it, the su-monster hid the pail in a jaculi's burrow. Ubtao asked the jungle animals where his water was hidden, and Moa the jaculi was too honest to lie. When Wongo the su-monster found out how Moa had betrayed him, he vowed to catch the jaculi and eat him up.

All the while, Unkh the flail snail lived deep under the earth. The noise of the other animals fighting made her slither up to the surface, and when day dawned over her shell, the light blinded Ubtao and made his eyes water. Life returned to Omu, and the people built shrines to honor the animals who'd saved them.

### City Inhabitants
Several factions dwell within Omu, including yuan-ti, grungs, vegepygmies, and kobolds. Explorers also come here in search of gold and glory. Presently, these include Red Wizards and three tabaxi hunters. Each of these groups can play as much of a role in the story as you desire. They could serve as enemies or as allies brought together by mutual interests.

#### Yuan-ti
Yuan-ti offer sacrifices to Dendar the Night Serpent in a sprawling underground temple beneath the ruins of Omu's royal palace (area 20); the temple is described in chapter 4. The yuan-ti guard the entrances to the city, patrol its streets, and send raiding parties into the surrounding jungle. **Ras Nsi** rules over them, but traitorous priests plot his downfall.

***Salida's Treachery.*** One of the guides presented in chapter 1 is **Salida**, a pureblood yuan-ti loyal to **Ras Nsi**. If **Salida** escorts the characters into the city, she'll surreptitiously use her *sending stone* to contact **Ras Nsi** so that he can prepare an ambush. When night falls, **Salida** uses a lantern to signal the yuan-ti attack. The attacking force consists of one type 3 **yuan-ti malison** and two **yuan-ti purebloods** per party member. **Ras Nsi** is keen to capture the characters so he can question them about their mission.

#### Grungs
A small colony of grungs lives on the rooftops around Nangnang's shrine (area 18). **Ras Nsi** regularly mounts raids on them to thin their numbers.

The grungs worship Nangnang and view her shrine as holy ground for their chieftain and his elite guards. **Yorb**, the mad grung chieftain, craves vengeance against **Ras Nsi** but hasn't yet found a worthy attack plan.

#### Vegepygmies
Years ago, a meteorite fell from the heavens and created the city's Great Rift. Stardust rained over the ruins and formed patches of russet mold out of which vegepygmies arose. Their tribes prowl the flooded backstreets. Yuan-ti have learned to shun these areas and kill the "moldies" on sight.

Omu contains several small tribes of vegepygmies. They clash over territory and are unified only in their reverence of the Great Rift. Even if the vegepygmies could communicate with the characters, they have little desire to work with them. Their chiefs aren't clever, and the characters could trick the vegepygmies to unify against a common enemy.

#### Kobolds
Nine deadly shrines hold the secret to entering the Tomb of the Nine Gods. To maintain the shrines' traps, **Acererak** recruited a tribe of kobolds to act as shrine menders. These creatures dwell in cellars beneath a ruined marketplace (area 15). **Acererak** has promised to transform their sorcerer, Kakarol, into a dragon if the kobolds keep their end of their bargain. Too impatient to wait for his ascension, Kakarol has taken to sleeping on a small hoard of treasure and insists his underlings address him as Great Wyrm. If the characters cut a deal with the kobolds, the sorcerer's greed is easily manipulated.

**Acererak** hasn't told the kobolds about his alliance with **Ras Nsi**. For their part, the yuan-ti are barely aware of the kobolds' existence.

#### Red Wizards of Thay
A group of Red Wizards entered the city a couple of days prior to the characters' arrival. They camped in the ruined compound at area 2, but **Ras Nsi**'s forces nearly wiped them out in a night raid. Those who survived the attack continue to search the ruins for the Soulmonger.

The survivors include four Red Wizards (LE male and female Thayan human **mages**) named Dyrax (male), Thazma (female), Yamoch (male), and Zagmira (female). Their red robes, shaved heads, and sallow complexions betray their allegiance to Thay. Eight mercenaries (LE male and female human **thugs** of various ethnicities) escort the wizards. The highest ranking mage, Zagmira, appears just eighteen years old, yet one half of her face is wizened and old. This effect is a holdover from a terrible ritual she performed to inhabit the body of her own granddaughter. All four mages carry spellbooks that contain all their prepared spells.

Zagmira has seen the entrance to the Tomb of the Nine Gods (area 14) and believes the Soulmonger is held within. The Red Wizards have separated to find the puzzle cubes needed to unlock the tomb (see "Puzzle Cubes").

A man named Orvex (see area 2) serves the Red Wizards as a scribe and translator, but his loyalty to them is tenuous. The adventurers can easily befriend him.

#### Tabaxi Hunters
In the twilight of their lives, venerable tabaxi sometimes leave their families and venture into the jungle to claim a hunter's death. A divine being known as the Cat Lord leads the bravest to Omu, where they spend their final days hunting dinosaurs and other jungle beasts.

Three elderly **tabaxi hunters** (see *appendix D*) stalk the city when the characters arrive. Their names are Hooded Lantern (male), **Bag of Nails** (male), and Copper Bell (female). The hunters know the city well, but care little for its history and keep clear of its shrines. They hunt alone and avoid contact with explorers. Rare weapons and hunting gear are the only items the characters could offer to gain their help.

Hooded Lantern has graying black fur, and cataracts cloud his left eye. He is preparing himself for a glorious death fighting the great tyrannosaurus rex known as the **King of Feathers** (see area 13). Copper Bell has speckled ginger fur and wears a torn blue cloth over her bony shoulders—the blanket used to comfort her cubs when they were infants. She retains much of her inquisitiveness and wry humor. **Bag of Nails** has gone mad and is described in area 7.

> ##### Old Omuan
>The Omuans wrote in Old Omuan, a cuneiform script that bears little resemblance to any other alphabet. A character with the cloistered scholar or sage background can translate an inscription written in Old Omuan with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check, while a warlock with the Eyes of the Rune Keeper invocation can translate Old Omuan script without a check. If the characters recover the "queen's decree" from the chwinga cart at area 11, they can use it to decode inscriptions written in Old Omuan. Without the queen's decree or a character with the appropriate background, the characters can translate Old Omuan writing only by using a *comprehend languages* spell or similar magic.
>

### Puzzle Cubes
To unlock the Tomb of the Nine Gods, the characters must first recover nine puzzle cubes from shrines hidden throughout the city. The Red Wizards are already searching for the cubes, and **Ras Nsi** does what he must to prevent the Red Wizards or the characters from obtaining all of them.

A puzzle cube is a stone cube 3 inches on a side and engraved with images of a specific trickster god. Each cube weighs half a pound. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each cube.

The puzzle cubes can't be destroyed by any means. If they're discarded, buried, or taken more than a mile outside Omu, they teleport back to their resting places inside their respective shrines. If the characters return to a previously cleared shrine, there's a cumulative 20 percent chance per day that kobolds have reset its traps.

![[052-302.webp|right|300]]

#### Learning of the Shrines
A few clues can point the players toward the shrines, including a lost journal found at a campsite (area 9). Characters can also discover the shrines on their own or learn about them from **Orvex Ocrammas** (area 2).

#### Race for the Puzzle Cubes
The characters need not explore all nine shrines. The Red Wizards find at least two of the puzzle cubes, and **Ras Nsi** always steps in to claim the final cube. Things play out differently if the players find a way to foil their enemies' plans—by killing them, for example.

On the day the characters claim their first puzzle cube, the Red Wizards clear a separate shrine within the city. While the Red Wizards remain active, there's a cumulative 25 percent chance per day that they claim another puzzle cube from a random shrine. If the players arrive at a cleared shrine, they discover a scene of devastation: traps sprung, monsters slain, and the cube missing.

Once five puzzle cubes have been taken from their shrines, **Ras Nsi** begins to set ambushes. When the characters arrive at their next shrine, three type 1 **yuan-ti malisons** and six **yuan-ti purebloods** ambush them. Their orders are to capture characters and bring them to the Fane of the Night Serpent for interrogation.

Once eight puzzle cubes have been claimed, **Ras Nsi** steals the ninth cube for himself and leaves an obvious trail leading pursuers to the main entrance of his underground temple (see area 20A). The characters must infiltrate the temple and either take the puzzle cube by force or convince **Ras Nsi** to part with it. For more information on the temple and its inhabitants, see chapter 4.

#### An Uneasy Alliance
The characters could form an alliance with the Red Wizards to recover the puzzle cube taken by the yuan-ti. If an accord is reached, Zagmira reveals that she has a spy in the yuan-ti temple: a yuan-ti pureblood named Ishmakahl (pronounced ISH-mah-kawl). Zagmira doesn't reveal that this spy is a doppelganger.

Zagmira encourages human characters to infiltrate the yuan-ti temple disguised as purebloods, with nonhuman characters posing as their slaves. If no human characters are present, Zagmira is willing to spend a 5th-level spell slot to cast *invisibility* on up to four party members. If the characters recover the puzzle cube taken by **Ras Nsi**, the Red Wizards turn against the characters and try to claim all the puzzle cubes for themselves once the characters emerge from the yuan-ti temple. If **Artus Cimber** is with the party, the Red Wizards also try to take the *Ring of Winter* from him.

If the Red Wizards obtain all nine puzzle cubes, they use them to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods and, one by one, fall prey to the tomb's insidious traps.

### Navigation
The city basin is densely packed with ruined villas and overgrown courtyards. Buildings in Omu are shaped from limestone. Thick, broad-leaved vines engulf most structures, while ferns and thorny bushes choke the streets. Statues representing the trickster gods leer from many junctions.

Cautious characters can move through the city at a rate of 200 feet every 5 minutes. Even if they throw caution to the wind, the density of the undergrowth makes it tricky to move faster than 200 feet per minute. If the characters stop to search for treasure, each building takes 30 minutes to clear. Whenever the party searches a ruined building, roll percentile dice and consult the Ruin Interior table to see what, if anything, the building contains.

#### Ruin Interior

| d100 | Ruin Contents |
|:---:|---|
| 01–40 | — |
| 41–50 | Assassin vines |
| 51–60 | Blue mist (and roll again) |
| 61–65 | Collapsing floor (and roll again) |
| 66–70 | Nest |
| 71–75 | Plant discovery |
| 76–85 | Treasure |
| 86–00 | Vegepygmies |

#### Assassin Vines
This ruin is choked with vines, lurking among which are 1d3 **assassin vines** (see *appendix D*).

#### Collapsing Floor
As the characters explore this building, choose one character at random to make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the floor collapses and the character falls 20 feet into a lower level, taking damage from the fall as normal. Roll again on the Ruin Interior table to see if there's anything interesting in the lower level.

#### Blue Mist
A thin, odorless blue mist lingers inside the ruin. Characters who enter the building expose themselves to blue mist fever (see "Diseases"). Roll again on the Ruin Interior table to see if there's anything else in the building.

#### Nest
Vermin have made a nest in the building. Roll a d6 and consult the Nest Occupants table to determine the nest's inhabitants. Any character damaged by a giant wasp must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of the encounter or become infected with shivering sickness (see "Diseases").

#### Nest Occupants

| d6 | Creatures |
|:---:|---|
| 1–2 | 1d6 **giant wasps** |
| 3–4 | 2d6 **stirges** |
| 5–6 | 1d3 **swarms of poisonous snakes** |

#### Plant Discovery
The ruin contains one or more rare plants, determined by rolling a d6 and consulting the Plant Discovery table. These plants are described in *appendix C*.

| d6 | Plant |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | 2d6 dancing monkey fruit hanging from a tree |
| 2 | Menga bush with 1d6 ounces of leaves |
| 3 | 1d6 ryath roots growing in the ground |
| 4 | 4d6 sinda berries growing on a bush |
| 5 | 1d6 wildroots |
| 6 | 2d6 zabou growing on the floor |

#### Treasure
The ruin contains 1d6 Omuan art objects (jade rings, painted pottery, silver-inlaid wooden statuettes of trickster gods, crystal vases, and so forth). Each art object is worth 25 gp.

#### Vegepygmies
Hiding in the ruin are 1d4 **vegepygmies** (see *appendix D*). They are not in a fighting mood and cower from interlopers. If attacked, they flee through cracks in the walls and attempt to hide in the surrounding marsh.

### Random Encounters in Omu
Adventurers are likely to have one or more random encounters as they explore Omu. See *appendix B* for more information on random encounters in the city.

## Locations in the City
The following descriptions correspond to areas marked on maps 3.1 and 3.2.

![[054-304a.webp|right|300]]
### 1. City Entrance

>>A guardhouse stands near the entrance to the city. Arrow slits are cut into its limestone walls, and a lopsided iron portcullis hangs over the gateway, beyond which you see an open plaza.
>>

If the characters enter the guardhouse, read:

>>Much of the interior has collapsed into rubble. Creepers cling to the walls, and high grasses sprout between the flagstones amid evidence of long-dead campfires. One wall is covered with graffiti—some words painted, others etched.
>>

The graffiti (written in Common) provides hints about the challenges that await:

>"Fear the fangs of **Ras Nsi**!"
>
>"Erik, I've gone in search of the nine shrines. V."
>
>"The puzzle cubes are the key."
>
>"Beware the frog monster!"
>
>"Who is Unkh?"
>
>"All hail the **King of Feathers**!"
>
>"The snakes are not what they seem."
>
>"Kubazan = bravery. Shagambi = wisdom. Moa = ?"
>

#### Ras Nsi's Scouts
Five **yuan-ti malisons** watch this entrance to the city from a small cave carved into the cliffside. A narrow goat track zigzags up the cliff to their hideout.

The group consists of two type 1 malisons, two type 2 malisons, and one type 3 malison. They follow the characters into Omu and shadow them through the streets. Their goal is to ambush the characters and capture at least one of them. If they remain out of sight, the yuan-ti launch their attack when the characters try to take their first long or short rest in the city.

#### Treasure
The type 3 malison's longbow is painted and carved like a serpent with tiny amber gemstones for eyes. The weapon is worth 250 gp as an art object.

### 2. Walled Compound

>>Smoke drifts lazily from a walled compound. The gate lies in splinters, and scorch marks deface the buildings. Near the center of the compound is a plaza littered with charred human corpses. One of the corpses is being torn apart by a pack of wild dogs.
>>

The Red Wizards seized this compound as their base of operations in Omu, but yuan-ti attacked and nearly wiped them out. Thirty corpses are scattered across the compound—the remains of three Red Wizards, twenty human mercenaries, and seven bearers hired in Port Nyanzaru. The yuan-ti looted all the supplies they found and stole their enemies' weapons. Six wild dogs (use **jackal** statistics) feed on one of the Red Wizards. The dogs pose no threat if the characters keep their distance.

#### Spirit Pole
The yuan-ti burned their dead comrades and arranged their bones into a spirit pole. Characters who explore the compound discover this effigy:

>>A glaive has been thrust into remains of a burned-out pyre. Charred snake skulls and blackened inhuman vertebrae are lashed to the spear. On a wall nearby, a symbol has been daubed in ash: a snake curled in a spiral, gripping a circle in its jaws.
>>

With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check, a character recognizes the sigil on the wall as the symbol of Dendar the Night Serpent devouring the world.

#### Orvex Ocrammas
![[055-303.webp|right|300]]

During the attack, an explosion buried a member of the Red Wizards' expedition under a fallen section of wall. **Orvex** is dying of thirst and exhaustion. As characters search the compound, they hear him calling out for help from under the rubble. If the characters free Orvex, he begs to join their band until he finds sanctuary.

Orvex serves as scribe and translator for the Red Wizards. He's a pragmatic, balding human in his early forties who serves the Red Wizards because, as he puts it, they pay well. **Orvex** has the statistics of a **spy**, with these changes:

- Orvex is neutral.
- He has 3 hit points remaining and 3 levels of exhaustion (see appendix A of the *Player's Handbook* for exhaustion effects).
- He speaks Common and Grung.

If the characters befriend Orvex, he can help them forge a truce with any surviving Red Wizards. Orvex can translate Old Omuan, and his studies of Omu's carvings taught him the legend of the nine trickster gods (see "Legend of the Nine Gods"), which Orvex is happy to recount once he's fully healed and rested.

Despite the obvious risks, Orvex looks forward to exploring more of the city and unlocking its secrets. If he's still with the characters when they retrieve all nine puzzle cubes, he jumps at the chance to accompany them on their descent into the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

### 3. Kubazan's Shrine

>>A rectangular pool of murky water stretches before this vine-draped shrine. Rope bridges that once spanned the water float on the surface, tangled with other debris. The shards of a toppled monolith form stepping stones to the middle of the pool, where a statue of a stone frog rises above the water.
>>

The shrine to the trickster god Kubazan (represented as a **froghemoth**) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

#### 3A. Froghemoth Pool
This pool is 6 feet deep and clouded with mud and algae. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the eyestalk of a **froghemoth** (see *appendix D*) sticking out of the pool. The froghemoth attacks anyone who disturbs the water or tries to reach the shrine, heaving itself from the pool to pursue prey.

The shattered monolith is slippery with moss, and the rotted rope bridges sink as soon as anyone steps on them. Any character who jumps across the stepping stones must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to keep from falling in the pool.

***Stone Key.*** A character who examines the mouth of the frog statue spots a stone key set into an indentation on the statue's tongue. This key opens the locked gate at area 3B.

#### 3B. Locked Gate
Carved into the lintel above this locked gate is an inscription written in Old Omuan: "Kubazan urges us to tread without fear and to give back as much as we take." A character who heeds the words gains some insight into the trial that awaits in area 3C.

To pick the lock, a character with thieves' tools must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity check. Whether the check succeeds or fails, a *glyph of warding* spell targets the character with a *fear* spell (save DC 15). The glyph doesn't trigger if the door is unlocked using the stone key from the froghemoth pool (area 3A).

#### 3C. Chamber of Bravery

>>Steps descend to a ledge overlooking a pit of sharpened stakes. An alcove on the far wall holds a pedestal with a stone cube resting on it. A relief carved into the back of the alcove shows a monstrous frog with tentacles fighting a crane. Wooden beams radiate from the walls at floor height, with four-foot gaps between them. Carved frog heads extrude from the walls above the beams.
>>

The wall relief shows Kubazan (a **froghemoth**) fighting Papazotl (an **eblis**). An inscription written in Old Omuan tells how Kubazan earned his tentacles from the god Ubtao (see "Legend of the Nine Gods").

***Spiked Pit.*** The pit is 30 feet deep. A creature that falls into the pit takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall and must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, 1d4 stakes impale the creature for an additional 1d6 piercing damage per stake.

***Wooden Beams.*** A creature can move around the perimeter of the room by hopping from beam to beam. To hop onto a beam without falling, a creature must succeed on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, the DC of which is 5 + the distance (in feet) between the two beams. When weight is applied to and lifted from a beam, it retracts and becomes flush with the wall, preventing it from being used again. The beams reset to their original positions after all of them have retracted into the walls.

***Puzzle Cube.*** If Kubazan's puzzle cube is removed from its pedestal, the gate in area 3B slams shut and locks. Checks made to pick the gate lock from within the shrine have disadvantage. At the same time, the carved frog heads on the walls open their mouths, belch forth enough poisonous gas to fill the shrine, and then close their mouths. Placing an object of equal weight to the puzzle cube (half a pound) on the pedestal prevents the gate closure and the release of gas.

The gas fills the shrine for 1 minute, then dissipates. Any creature that starts its turn inside the shrine while the gas is present must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

![[057-305a.webp|right|300]]
### 4. Shagambi's Shrine

>>A ruined shrine stands at the heart of this walled compound. Tall monoliths flank the entrance, decorated with images of a jaguar with six snakes sprouting from its shoulders. A stone door is set into the shrine beyond.
>>

The shrine to the trickster god Shagambi (represented as a **kamadan**) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

Two mated **kamadans** (see *appendix D*) use a cart at the back of the shrine as their lair. If they hear intruders approaching the shrine, the kamadans try to ambush them. The kamadans fight tooth and claw to protect their three young cubs. Kamadan cubs are noncombatants that look like baby leopards and grow to adult size within a year. The cubs' snakes won't sprout from their shoulders for another 6 months. Characters can capture the cubs and spend months trying to domesticate them, but the kamadans turn on their would-be masters once they reach adulthood in a year.

#### 4A. Shrine Entrance
Flanking the entrance are two stone monoliths, each one 15 feet tall and draped in vines. Characters who examine the carvings uncover an inscription written in Old Omuan: "Shagambi teaches us to fight evil with honor." Reliefs on the monoliths show Shagambi overseeing Chultan warriors as they train with spears and swords.

The door to the shrine is not locked, but it hangs heavy on its hinges. It weighs 600 pounds, so one or more characters must have a combined Strength score of 20 or higher to push it open.

#### 4B. Arena Gallery
When one or more characters enter the shrine, read:

>>Steps descend into a fifteen-foot-high, moss-covered room. Four statues of Omuan warriors stand in alcoves to either side, overlooking a barred gladiatorial pit in the floor. Each statue looks like it was meant to hold a spear, but its weapon is missing. On the far side of the chamber, a stone pedestal stands conspicuously bare. A relief on the wall behind it shows a monstrous jaguar with six snakes protruding from its shoulders, fighting off a squat, frog-like humanoid armed with a spear. To the left of the relief is a narrow tunnel with stairs leading down.
>>

The statues can't be moved from their alcoves, and they are impervious to damage and spells. The tunnel in the north wall slopes down to the bottom of the gladiatorial pit (area 4D) and leads to a cellblock beyond (area 4C).

The wall relief depicts Shagambi (a kamadan) fighting Nangnang (a grung). Just below, an inscription written in Old Omuan tells the story of how Nangnang stole Shagambi's spear (see "Legend of the Nine Gods"). With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices tiny holes in the relief. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the poison gas from penetrating through when the pedestal is disturbed (see below).

***Pedestal.*** The pedestal is a 4-foot-high stone cylinder that is impervious to damage and spells. Close inspection reveals a stone hatch in the top of it. Any physical attempt to force open the hatch releases a cloud of gas through the holes in the wall relief. The gas fills a 15-foot cube directly in front of the mural. Creatures in the area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. The gas affects a creature even if it holds its breath or doesn't need to breathe. The gas doesn't linger.

***Puzzle Cube.*** To obtain Shagambi's puzzle cube, the characters must obtain the four bronze spears from the monsters in area 4C and place the weapons in the hands of the four warrior statues. Only by defeating the monsters in the gladiatorial pit can the spears be obtained. When all four spears are placed in the hands of the statues, read:

>>The pedestal begins to turn on the spot, and an ornate stone cube corkscrews up from a hatch in its top.
>>

Once it rises up out of the pedestal, Shagambi's puzzle cube can be safely removed.

#### 4C. Gladiator Cells
This hallway contains four cramped cells behind iron portcullises. The portcullises are locked in place and can be raised only with a *knock* spell or by stepping on the pressure plate in area 4D. Each cell contains a **Chultan gladiator** made of painted clay. Each gladiator is a golem-like creature with a bronze spear in one hand and a wooden shield in the other. It has the statistics of a **gladiator**, with these changes:

- The **clay gladiator** is an unaligned construct with an Armor Class of 17 (natural, shield).
- It has a climbing speed of 30 feet and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- It is immune to poison damage as well as the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions. It doesn't need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe.
- It doesn't speak.
- It can't make ranged attacks, and it can't be disarmed.

A **clay gladiator** fights if attacked or when called to the gladiatorial pit (area 4D). If reduced to 0 hit points outside of the gladiatorial pit, the gladiator disappears along with its possessions, reappears in its cell at full health with spear and shield in hand, and returns to the gladiatorial pit if it can. If defeated in the gladiatorial pit, the gladiator leaves its spear behind before reforming in its cell. The spear can then be taken back to area 4B. If taken from the shrine, the spear disappears and reappears in the gladiator's hand.

The gladiators can go anywhere in the shrine but can't leave it. When the shrine has no other creatures inside it, the gladiators return to their cells, and the portcullises drop behind them.

#### 4D. Gladiatorial Pit
This pit is 20 feet deep, and its bars are spaced 2 feet apart. A Medium or smaller creature can easily slip between the bars, but the walls of the pit are too smooth to climb without the aid of climbing gear or magic.

Six-foot-high archways stand opposite one another at the bottom of the pit, the floor of which is one large pressure plate. Applying 50 pounds or more to the floor causes the portcullises in area 4C to rise with a loud clatter, whereupon the clay gladiators emerge from their cells and quickly make their way to the pit.

### 5. Great Rift

>>Tumbledown ruins cling to the lip of a rift overlooking a lake of bubbling lava.
>>

A creature that falls from the top of the cliff into the lava takes 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall and 55 (10d10) fire damage from the lava. A creature that starts its turn in the lava takes the fire damage again.

#### Sacrifice of Fire
The first time the characters arrive, they encounter a small vegepygmy tribe preparing to sacrifice a **grung** (see *appendix D*) to the rift. The grung, Imbok, is bound with vines and restrained. As the grung struggles, the vegepygmies encircle him and perform a strange, ritualistic dance. Unless the characters intervene, the vegepygmies roll their captive off the edge of the cliff. A couple of vegepygmies leap off after him, caught in the throes of devotion.

The tribe consists of one **vegepygmy chief**, eight **vegepygmies**, and the chief's **thorny** pet. Statistics for all these creatures appear in *appendix D*. Their grung captive is the beloved one hundred and eightieth son of the grung chieftain **Yorb**. If the characters free Imbok, he grovels at their feet. He doesn't speak Common but promises to bury his benefactors in gold if they escort him back to his father's shrine (area 18). Imbok's promise is empty, but he has nothing else to offer his saviors.

### 6. Moa's Shrine
This shrine perches on a pinnacle of rock high above the great rift (area 5).

>>A column of rock rises 200 feet above the lava. A walled ruin overgrown with palms perches on the summit.
>>

At its narrowest point, the gulf between the shrine and the rest of the city is 60 feet wide. Characters with rope and grappling hooks can throw a line across the gap.

The shrine to the trickster god Moa (represented by a jaculi) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

#### 6A. Shrine Entrance

>>Palm trees grow in front of this squat building, and worn steps ascend to an archway that forms the entrance. Reliefs of coiled serpents flank the entrance.
>>

Four **jaculis** (see *appendix D*) lurk in the courtyard, using their camouflage to hide while coiled around tree trunks. If the characters enter the courtyard, the jaculis spring forth and attack.

#### 6B. Trapped Passage

>>The walls of this rubble-strewn corridor are carved with serpents, and arrow slits are spaced along them every 5 feet. Cobwebs fill the arrow slits and hang like drapes from the corridor ceiling. Above the entrance, a stone plaque bears a cuneiform message.
>>

The message on the plaque is written in Old Omuan and reads, "Moa teaches us that secrets hide the truth." Explorers must heed this message to find the shrine's puzzle cube.

The arrow slits are 6 inches wide, 2 feet tall, and 1 foot deep. A character who peers through an arrow slit after clearing out the cobwebs can see into the room beyond (area 6D), provided the character has a light source or can see in the dark.

***Pits.*** Three covered pits are spaced along the corridor in the positions marked X on the shrine map. Their covers remain locked until the puzzle cube is moved from the pedestal in area 6C. Thereafter, a creature stepping on a pit cover causes it to swing open and falls in unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Each pit is 10 feet deep and has a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) at the bottom of it.

A character who searches the hallway floor for traps finds a pit trap with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The lids are cleverly constructed and can be jammed shut only by using magic such as an *arcane lock* spell.

#### 6C. Chamber of Deception

>>In the middle of this room, a stone cube rests on a plain stone pedestal. Statues of twelve tribal warriors jut from the surrounding walls, aiming bows at the pedestal. The floor in front of the pedestal bears a mosaic depicting a monstrous serpent constricting a furious monkey. Moss obscures much of the detail.
>>

The mosaic shows Moa (a **jaculi**) fighting Wongo (a **su-monster**). If a character peels the moss aside, they uncover the following message written in Old Omuan: "Death rewards a thief deceived. Truth comes from the serpent's mouth." Another inscription encircles the floor and tells the story of how Moa upheld the truth to Ubtao and betrayed Wongo's trust (see "Legend of the Nine Gods").

The puzzle cube on the pedestal is illusory, though it feels real to the touch. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of illusion magic around the cube. When taken from the shrine, it vanishes in a puff of green smoke. If a creature removes the puzzle cube from the pedestal or tries to damage one of the statues, the archers animate and open fire on all creatures in the room. The archers can detect the presence of creatures even if they are invisible. Before they open fire, arrows magically appear in their bows. The archers remain animated for 1 hour, after which they revert to their inanimate state.

The twelve archers act on initiative count 20. On its turn, a statue shoots one arrow (+6 to hit). A creature hit by an arrow takes 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage. Each statue is a Medium object with AC 17; 30 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

***Secret Doors.*** Characters who search the walls for secret doors find one on each side of the entrance tunnel with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### 6D. Western Secret Room

>>A statue of a coiled serpent dominates this web-filled room. The statue is missing its head, which lies broken on the floor next to a stone cube.
>>

The statue is 7 feet tall without its head. The puzzle cube lying on the floor next to the head's shattered remains is fake and vanishes in a puff of green smoke when taken from the shrine. Bringing it into area 6C activates the statues there.

#### 6E. Eastern Secret Room

>>A large statue of a coiled serpent dominates this web-filled room. Clutched in the statue's jaws is a stone cube.
>>

The statue is 8 feet tall and harmless.

***Puzzle Cube.*** The cube is Moa's puzzle cube. It can be removed from the statue's jaws and the shrine safely.

### 7. Fallen Tree

>>A fallen tree bridges the river ahead. Its trunk is wider than a man and stretches more than 100 feet. On both banks lie ruined buildings.
>>

An elderly tabaxi hunter named **Bag of Nails** ambushes the characters if they try to ford the river here.

The fallen trunk is wide enough for two Medium creatures to pass each other safely. Under the tree, the water churns toward the falls 200 feet downriver. A creature that tumbles into the river or tries to swim across it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check to reach the bank. If the check fails, the current pulls the creature toward the falls at a speed of 50 feet per round.

#### Bag of Nails
![[058-306.webp|right|300]]

**Bag of Nails** yearns for a hunter's death. Senility has taken hold, and now he sees all creatures as his prey.

When the characters arrive, **Bag of Nails** is hiding in a ruined building on the east bank of the river, 150 feet from the fallen tree. To spot him, a character must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check. When a character crosses the bridge, **Bag of Nails** opens fire. After each shot, he leaps across the rooftops to a new firing position and tries to hide.

**Bag of Nails** is a tabaxi **assassin**, with these changes:

- **Bag of Nails** is chaotic neutral.
- He has a climbing speed of 20 feet and the Feline Agility trait (see below).
- He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- He knows Common, Dwarvish, and thieves' cant.
- As an action, he can make a melee weapon attack with his claws (+3 to hit), dealing 1d4 slashing damage on a hit.
- He carries a longbow instead of a crossbow (range 150/600 ft.).

>***Feline Agility.*** When the tabaxi moves on its turn in combat, it can double its speed until the end of the turn. Once it uses this trait, the tabaxi can't use it again until it moves 0 feet on one of its turns.

If **Bag of Nails** drops to fewer than half his maximum hit points, he surrenders to his enemies, leads them to his lair (a ruined basement), and offers them stew in a show of friendship. While distributing bowls of stew, he explains that he came to Omu to find a fabled treasure called the Navel of the Moon (see chapter 5). He hoped to use its alleged powers to find his lost son, but he has long since given up hope of ever finding it. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the tabaxi has no intention of letting the characters leave his domain alive. He laces the stew with *midnight tears (ingested)* (see "*Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

#### Treasure
Characters who search through the tabaxi hunter's lair find five doses of *midnight tears (ingested)* in a hollow gourd and enough gear to make an explorer's pack.

### 8. Unkh's Shrine

>>Swirly carvings decorate two obelisks at the entrance to this compound. An overgrown courtyard lies under the shade of tall palms. Stone doors seal the entrance to a windowless shrine, with a smaller ruin standing nearby.
>>

The shrine to the trickster god Unkh (represented by a flail snail) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

#### 8A. Shrine Entrance
Above the doors is written an inscription in Old Omuan: "Unkh urges us to contrast all options before acting." Unkh's priests were contemplative but prone to indecision. Their message is a clue to solving the shrine's puzzle. The doors to the shrine are not locked and hang heavy on their hinges. Each door weighs 600 pounds, so one or more characters need a combined Strength score of 20 or higher to heave them open.

#### 8B. Ruined Workshop

>>The roof of this workshop collapsed long ago, and now a thick mass of plants grows from the rubble. Through the moss, you see hundreds of iron keys hanging from hooks on the wall. Some are bent and broken, while others are rusted beyond repair. The rest look serviceable.
>>

One of the keys unlocks the pedestal in area 8C. If the characters know which key to look for, they find it after a few minutes of searching.

#### 8C. Chamber of Contemplation

>>A statue of a giant snail looms before you. In place of antennae, it has five pseudopods ending in rocky clubs. Along the walls, six iron keys hang in small niches above stone plinths. Behind the statue, a carved pedestal in a wide alcove has a keyhole set into its base.
>>

The statue is 9 feet tall and represents the trickster god Unkh as a flail snail. Three **ghasts** (undead Chultan tribesfolk) hide behind it. Each ghast has **Ras Nsi**'s symbol—a small blue triangle—tattooed on its forehead. The ghasts leap out from behind the statue and attack as soon as the characters enter the room.

None of the keys in this room unlock the pedestal. However, they are all similar in size. If a character takes all six keys and overlaps them, their overlapping teeth form a particular pattern. A search of the ruined workshop (area 8B) yields a single key that matches this pattern. This key unlocks the pedestal.

***Puzzle Cube.*** Unkh's puzzle cube is hidden inside the pedestal. If a character inserts the correct key in the keyhole and turns the key a quarter turn clockwise, the puzzle cube emerges from a concealed hatch:

>>The pedestal grinds around on the spot. As it turns, an ornate stone cube corkscrews up from a concealed hatch in its surface.
>>

The puzzle cube can now be safely removed from its pedestal.

Using thieves' tools, a character can pick the lock on the pedestal with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check. A character who fails the check by 5 or more accidentally triggers the trap.

***Trap.*** If a character inserts the wrong key into the keyhole at the base of the pedestal or botches an attempt to pick the lock, the shell of the flail snail statue emits dazzling rays of light that fire in all directions. When this happens, each creature in the shrine must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Any creature that fails the save is struck by a ray and takes 33 (6d10) radiant damage. The statue can't emit rays while wholly or partly contained with an *antimagic field*.

### 9. Adventurers' Camp

>>Amid the ruins is an abandoned campsite. Torn backpacks and rotted gear litter the ground around the three moldering tents. At the center of the camp, a scrap of dirty yellow cloth hangs from a crude wooden flagpole.
>>

This camp was made by the Company of the Yellow Banner, a party of explorers that arrived in Omu over six months ago. All the explorers are now dead. For further details, see chapter 5.

Characters who search the area discover a moldy parchment caught in the lining of one of the tents; give the players a copy of handout 13 (see appendix E). The leader of the company, Lord Brixton, left this letter behind for a missing comrade. The rest of the camp has since been looted.

#### Development
If the characters stay at the camp for an hour or more, a randomly determined Red Wizard (see "Red Wizards of Thay") stumbles upon them. The Red Wizard is accompanied by two mercenaries and is searching for Omuan shrines. A battle is certain unless the party has struck up an alliance with Zagmira, in which case the Red Wizard offers to join forces with the party.

### 10. I'jin's Shrine

>>Cracked monoliths flank the entrance to this ruin. Saw-edged ferns grow in the courtyard between broken flagstones. A pair of stone doors provide entry to a large, flat-roofed ruin.
>>

The shrine to the trickster god I'jin (represented by an almiraj) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

#### 10A. Shrine Entrance
A harmless **almiraj** (see *appendix D*) lives in a burrow underneath the courtyard and goes to ground as soon as it senses intruders. When a character approaches the door, read:

>>Sculptural reliefs decorate the doors of this shrine. The carvings show a horned rabbit charging a small, feral-looking bear with sharp claws. A cuneiform message is etched above the doors.
>>

The message is written in Old Omuan and reads, "I'jin teaches us to take the path least expected." I'jin taught her followers to live unpredictable lives, always changing course and never sticking to a plan. Characters would do well to heed her message inside the shrine.

Smaller inscriptions hidden underneath the carvings tell the story of how I'jin (an almiraj) earned the ire of Obo'laka (a zorbo) by spoiling a stew prepared for the god Ubtao. For details, see "Legend of the Nine Gods."

#### 10B. Puzzle Floor

>>A ten-foot-wide hallway strikes off into the gloom. Carved tiles depicting various beasts decorate the hallway floor.
>>

Give the players a copy of handout 14 in appendix E.

Thirty-two tiles cover a 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide stretch of the hallway. Each tile is 5 feet square, and the tiles are arranged in eight rows of four. The beasts depicted on the tiles are almiraj (see *appendix D*), dragonflies, eagles, giraffes, monkeys, tigers, warthogs, and zebras.

***Poison Darts.*** To cross the hallway safely, a character must avoid stepping on the same animal more than once. If more than 20 pounds of pressure is exerted on the wrong picture tile, four poison darts shoot from holes in the walls. Each dart makes a ranged weapon attack (+5 to hit) against a random target within 10 feet of the triggering tile. A single creature can be attacked by multiple darts. A creature hit by a dart takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A character can spot the holes with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts from launching.

Characters can avoid the trap by flying or teleporting across the hallway, or by using *spider climb* spells to crawl along the walls or ceiling. The walls are too smooth to climb otherwise.

***Almiraj Tiles.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each almiraj tile. A creature that steps on an almiraj tile gains 2d10 temporary hit points. Once a tile has bestowed this benefit, it loses its magic until the next dawn. Casting *dispel magic* on a tile has the same effect.

#### 10C. Labyrinth
Traps are riddled throughout this dusty maze. Hidden pressure plates in the floor are located in the positions marked X on the shrine map. If more than 20 pounds of pressure is exerted on a pressure plate, a sharpened axe blade swings from a hidden compartment in the ceiling. The blade makes a melee attack (+6 to hit) against any creature standing on the pressure plate. On a hit, the target takes 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage. A character searching for traps spots a pressure plate and ceiling compartment with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. Wedging an iron spike or other object under a plate prevents the trap from triggering. Using thieves' tools, a character can dismantle an axe blade with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the trap triggers and makes an attack against the character with disadvantage.

#### 10D. Puzzle Cube
The doors of this chamber are not locked or trapped.

>>A shaft of natural light spills from a tiny square hole in the ceiling onto a carved stone pedestal. An ornate stone cube rests on its surface.
>>

The cube is I'jin's puzzle cube. It is not trapped and can be safely removed from the pedestal.

### 11. Chwinga Wagon

>>An overturned wagon lies on the street ahead. Rotting flower petals litter the ground around it, and bees nest in its broken wheels. A freshly cut garland of jungle flowers hangs from the wagon's tongue.
>>

The wagon is home to a **chwinga** (see *appendix D*). The vegepygmies in the area are afraid of the chwinga and bring it gifts of flowers to appease its wrath. In truth, the chwinga is harmless.

The chwinga uses its magic to hide in a mossy stone disk underneath the cart (see "Queen's Decree" below). Characters who approach the cart notice that the area is unusually lush and full of life. If they leave an offering, the chwinga timidly presents itself to them. If not, the chwinga's natural curiosity forces it to shadow the characters and spy on them.

The scent of honey foreshadows the chwinga's appearance, and harmless bees follow it around. It has a fascination for humanoid hair and is likely to latch onto a bearded dwarf or a character with curly tresses. While the chwinga accompanies the party, any vegepygmies that encounter the group flee as soon as they discern the chwinga's presence. The chwinga's affinity for the natural world keeps it from following characters into shrines or dungeons.

#### Queen's Decree
If the characters look under the wagon, read:

>>A moss-covered stone disk lies half-buried in the mud underneath the wagon. Concentric rings of inscriptions cover its surface—some written in Common and others etched in jagged cuneiform.
>>

The tablet is a proclamation from an Omuan queen to her rivals in Mezro. The Mezroans couldn't read the Omuans' native script, so the tablet contains the same message written both in Common and Old Omuan. It reads, "Queen Napaka proclaims that the free people of Omu fear nothing. Brave new gods protect us, as Ubtao did before but does no longer. Omu will rise again, and Napaka shall reclaim all that is hers by right of conquest."

Using the tablet, the characters can translate any message written in Old Omuan. The tablet is 3 feet in diameter and weighs 200 pounds, but characters with ink and parchment can copy it or take a rubbing. If the characters move the tablet from the cart, they end up taking the chwinga with it.

### 12. Wongo's Shrine

>>Carvings of monkeys hanging by their tails decorate two cracked obelisks that stand before a shrine enclosed by broken walls. Past the obelisks is a courtyard filled with horsetails and arum lilies. Five archways open into darkness at the base of the ruin. Mounted above the central arch is a stone plaque bearing a cuneiform inscription.
>>

The shrine to the trickster god Wongo (represented by a su-monster) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods. The inscription above the central arch is written in Old Omuan and reads as follows: "Better to be Wongo's friend than his enemy."

***Portcullises.*** Portcullises are raised into the lintels above four of the five entrance corridors. When a character claims the puzzle cube from area 12B, the portcullises slam shut and seal off these corridors. Each portcullis weighs 600 pounds and can be lifted by one or more characters with a combined Strength score of at least 20. A character can prevent a portcullis from dropping by jamming it with at least two iron spikes.

#### 12A. Cracked Obelisks
Creatures that pass between these two obelisks hear in their heads a cacophony of shrieking monkeys. The sound fades once the creatures move elsewhere. The shrieks are annoying but harmless. The obelisks are not magical, and their effect can't be dispelled.

#### 12B. Test of Friendship

>>A ten-foot-tall stone statue of an evil-looking monkey balances on its tail atop a stone dais in the middle of this twenty-foot-high chamber. The statue's limbs are splayed, with hands and feet cupped. On the wall behind, a sculpted relief shows a monkey-like creature tearing into a giant serpent. Cuneiform inscriptions are carved above and below the relief. Four masks of painted stone protrude from the walls; they depict the heads of a lion, a **zebra**, a boar, and a vulture.
>>

The wall relief shows the trickster god Wongo (a su-monster) fighting his hated enemy, Moa (a jaculi). Inscriptions in Old Omuan explain how Moa betrayed Wongo to the god Ubtao (see "Legend of the Nine Gods").

***Statue and Puzzle Cube.*** A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the statue, which is easy to climb. A character who searches the statue's base uncovers the following inscription written in Old Omuan: "Wongo's friend knows where to pour the water." Wongo's "friend" (the vulture) can be identified by figuring out the logic puzzle written above the masks in the viewing corridors (area 12C).

When a character pours a pint or more of water into the statue's right hand or one of its cupped feet, the liquid sizzles and transforms into 1d3 **steam mephits** that fight until destroyed. The statue can create up to six steam mephits in this fashion, after which no more mephits can be created until the next dawn. A steam mephit reduced to 0 hit points loses its form and disappears.

When a pint or more of water is poured into the statue's cupped left hand, Wongo's puzzle cube appears by magic on the statue's head. When the puzzle cube appears, the character who poured the water hears a snarling, disembodied voice say, "Take the prize and curse your friends, or fight my children to claim it. What is your choice?" If a character takes the puzzle cube, the masks on the walls deliver their curses (see area 12C). If no character takes the cube immediately, the portcullises slam shut over the entrance corridors in area 12A as four **su-monsters** (see *appendix D*) are teleported into the room, clinging to the statue like startled children to a protective parent. The su-monsters leap down and attack. Once the su-monsters appear, taking the puzzle cube doesn't trigger the masks' curses. The summoned su-monsters are real, and their bodies don't disappear when they die.

***Masks.*** Characters who examine the stone masks on the walls see that their eyes are open holes, allowing one to peer into the adjoining corridors (area 12C). The masks are extensions of the walls and can't be removed without destroying them.

#### 12C. Viewing Corridors
Each of these four corridors ends in a molded stone mask that juts into area 12B. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around each mask. Inscriptions in Old Omuan are carved into the walls above the masks on this side.

>**Lion Mask (L**). The inscription above this mask reads, "I ate one of the boar's friends." A character who peers through the mask sees a ray of blue light falling from the ceiling onto the right hand of the statue in area 12B.
>
>**Boar Mask (B**). The inscription above this mask reads, "The vulture is lucky to be alive." Through this mask, a character sees a ray of blue light falling onto the left foot of the statue in area 12B.
>
>**Zebra Mask (Z**). The inscription above this mask reads, "My only friend starved to death." Through this mask, a character sees a ray of blue light falling onto the right foot of the statue in area 12B.
>
>**Vulture Mask (V**). The inscription above this mask reads, "One of the others has no friends." Through this mask, a character sees a ray of blue light falling onto the left hand of the statue in area 12B.
>

When the masks deliver their curses (see area 12B), any character who has looked through a mask in the last hour must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or transform into the creature depicted on the last mask they looked through. This curse functions as a *polymorph* spell and ends after 24 hours.

A **zebra** has the same statistics as a **riding horse**. Statistics for the **boar**, **lion**, and **vulture** also appear in the *Monst**er Manual*.

### 13. Amphitheater

>>A ruined amphitheater looms over the surrounding buildings. Vines cling to its steps, and animal statues line its stands. The muddy ground outside is stripped clean of vegetation. An eerie silence hangs over the area. No birds cry, no insects chirp, nothing stirs.
>>

The amphitheater is the lair of the **King of Feathers**, a powerful tyrannosaurus rex with magical abilities. As they approach the amphitheater, characters can't fail to notice giant clawed footprints in the mud. From toe to heel, each footprint spans over 5 feet. Closer to the ruin, they find long, slender feathers in scarlet, orange, and green hues, and heaps of dung large enough to bury a dwarf.

The amphitheater is an open-air, semicircular structure with tiered seats overlooking a ruined stage. The Omuans used it for public debates and plays both comic and tragic. Narrow passages and rubble-strewn chambers spread beneath the grandstands. This darkened maze is home to five **deinonychuses** (see *appendix D*). While the tyrannosaurus is out hunting, the deinonychuses leave their lair and prowl throughout the amphitheater, attacking other creatures on sight. Strewn about their lair are Omuan relics (see "Treasure" below).

#### Hail to the King
During the day, there is a 50 percent chance that the **King of Feathers** rests in the amphitheater. At night, this chance decreases to 25 percent. If the beast is out hunting, there is a cumulative 20 percent chance per hour of it returning. The **King of Feathers** is a feathered **tyrannosaurus rex**, with these changes:

- The **King of Feathers** is a monstrosity with 200 hit points.
- It can see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible.
- It can innately cast *misty step* at will, requiring no components. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom.
- It has the Legendary Resistance trait and the Summon Swarm action option (see below). It can't use the Summon Swarm action while it is grappling a creature with its jaws.

>***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the **King of Feathers** fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

>***Summon Swarm (Recharge 5–6).*** The **King of Feathers** exhales a **swarm of insects (wasps)** that forms in a space within 20 feet of it. The swarm acts as an ally of the **King of Feathers** and takes its turn immediately after it. The swarm disperses after 1 minute.

#### Treasure
A search of the rooms under the amphitheater uncovers an electrum platter inscribed with images of Chultan feasting rituals (25 gp), an Omuan death mask made of painted gold (250 gp), and a *helm of telepathy*.

> ##### The King of Feathers
>The monstrous tyrannosaurus known as the **King of Feathers** is the undisputed lord of Omu. Most other dwellers of the Forbidden City live in fear of its thunderous approach and steer well clear of the amphitheater, its lair.
>
>The **King of Feathers** can be encountered anywhere within Omu. At first, tease the characters with glimpses of it moving through distant fog or have them hear its roar echoing over the ruins. It might appear while the heroes are exploring the ruins or taking a rest. Alternatively, it might interrupt a fight that's going badly for the party (or is too easy).
>

### 14. Tomb of the Nine Gods
A vine-draped obelisk marks the entrance to the Tomb of the Nine Gods. For full details, refer to chapter 5.

### 15. Ruined Bazaar

>>A derelict market hall stands on the street corner ahead. Frayed cloth awnings hang in tatters above a broad alley lined with stalls.
>>

Kobolds live in hidden cellars underneath the ruined market hall and have set six traps throughout the bazaar. A character has a cumulative 20 percent chance of finding a trap for each minute spent searching the bazaar. When a trap is found, have the character make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the check succeeds, the character spots the trap (a hidden, spring-loaded catapult) and its triggering mechanism (a tripwire or pressure plate) without triggering it. Once spotted, the trap is easily disarmed or avoided (no check required). A failed check indicates that the character accidentally set off the trap, which duplicates the Weapon Invention attack of a **kobold inventor** (see *appendix D*).

After the characters find three traps, they spot a **kobold** disappearing down a well-hidden staircase on the outskirts of the bazaar. If they follow the creature, it leads them to the cellars under the marketplace.

#### Kobold Cellars
The kobolds live in cellars not shown on map 3.1. All but one of the staircases leading into their lair has been caved in or blocked with heaps of furniture. As the characters make their way through the cellars, read:

>>Guttering torches cast dim light under the arches of a wine cellar roughly 20 feet square. The cracked ceiling is 8 feet high. In an alcove on the far side of the room, a pile of treasure twinkles in the torchlight. Kobolds gather around it.
>>

Kakarol, a **kobold scale sorcerer**, rests on the pile of treasure. Two **kobold inventors** and ten **kobolds** are also present. Statistics for the kobold scale sorcerer and kobold inventor appear in *appendix D*.

The kobolds rally to defend Kakarol. While they fight off intruders, Kakarol and his inventors make ranged attacks from the rear. If things look dire, Kakarol throws himself at the characters' mercy.

#### Treasure
Kakarol wears a torn, 6-foot-long tapestry of a macaw decorated with garnet beads (75 gp) as a cloak. His hoard contains 30 gp, 250 sp, 1,800 cp, a colored glass statuette of a dragonfly (25 gp), four bloodstones (50 gp each), and a *potion of greater healing*.

#### Development
Kakarol believes that **Acererak** is going to transform him into a dragon. As such, the kobold is arrogant, greedy, and vain—traits that can be used against him. He knows nothing of **Acererak**'s true aims, nor has he been told about the Soulmonger. Kakarol's kobolds spy on most other factions in the city. If gifted with enough treasure, he could become a useful early warning system for the adventurers.

### 16. Papazotl's Shrine

>>Crocodiles wallow in this muddy lake bed, from which rises a walled ruin. Two columns flank the entrance, carved with images of a long-legged bird with a needle-like beak. At the building's front, slimy steps ascend to an entry arch.
>>

The shrine to the trickster god Papazotl (represented by an eblis) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods. The water around the shrine is 2 feet deep.

#### 16A. Shrine Entrance
A plaque above the shrine entrance displays an inscription in Old Omuan: "Papazotl teaches us to bow before no one." Characters who remember the cult's motto gain an edge when they explore Papazotl's tomb in chapter 5.

Four hungry **crocodiles** lurk in the shrine's flooded courtyard. These creatures are the offspring of a **giant crocodile** that nests to the rear of the shrine. If the characters attack the crocodiles, their mother joins the fray 2 rounds later.

#### 16B. Mosaic Floor

>>Moss clings to the stonework throughout this hall. The mosaic floor depicts a tall bird using its long, pointy beak to pin a monstrous frog-like creature with tentacles sprouting from its shoulders. Set into the far wall is a set of heavy stone doors.
>>

The mosaic shows the trickster god Papazotl (an eblis) fighting his enemy, Kubazan (a froghemoth). Inscriptions in Old Omuan surround the mosaic. If the characters translate these, they learn the story of how Kubazan disobeyed Papazotl and was cursed (see "Legend of the Nine Gods").

The doors are not locked but hang heavy on their hinges. Each door weighs 600 pounds, so one or more characters must have a combined Strength score of 20 or higher to force it open.

#### 16C. Chamber of Command

>>An empty pedestal stands in the middle of this chamber. Six statues face it from alcoves on the walls. They depict bare-chested humans with the heads of different animals. From left to right, the heads resemble those of a lizard, a jaguar, a lobster, a toucan, a bat, and a frog.
>>

A character who examines the pedestal finds a riddle inscribed on its base. (Give players a copy of handout 15 in *appendix E*.) Unlike other inscriptions in the trial chambers, this riddle is etched in Common:

>>Comes with sunshine
>>
>>Leaves with night
>>
>>Hides in darkness
>>
>>Does not bite
>>
>>Always joined to its caster
>>
>>Never strays from its master
>>

The answer to the riddle ("a shadow") is a clue to finding the secret chamber (area 16D). If a character holds a light source close to the statue with the head of a bat, a crawlway appears in its shadow. The crawlway entrance is otherwise hidden behind an illusory wall that can be dispelled with a *dispel magic* spell. The crawlway, which is 2 feet wide and 3 feet high, leads to area 16D.

***Puzzle Cube.*** If a character searches the pedestal, they discover the outline of a stone hatch on its upper surface. No matter how hard the characters try, they cannot pry the hatch open. Papazotl's puzzle cube within only emerges when all six statues are blindfolded (see area 16D). When this occurs, read:

>>The pedestal rotates, and an ornate stone cube emerges from a hatch on its surface.
>>

The characters can now safely take the puzzle cube.

#### 16D. Hidden Room

>>A strange grid is etched into the far wall of this stone cell.
>>

When a character enters this chamber, give the players a copy of handout 16 in *appendix E*. This grid is a puzzle key. If the letters from the riddle in area 16C are entered into the grid (minus spaces), the letters in the darkened squares spell out "cover eyes." This phrase provides a clue to obtaining the puzzle cube in area 16C.

### 17. Waterfall
A river courses through a rocky ravine before plunging 50 feet into a 30-foot-deep pool. A creature that goes over the waterfall must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12 (5d4) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one. There is no safe path from the top of the waterfall to the city below.

#### Vision of Acererak
The first character to look out across the city from the clifftops near the waterfall sees a vision of Omu's fall:

>>A city of magnificent, whitewashed buildings stretches out before you. Sunlight sparkles off of glass domes and windows, yet all is not well. Black smoke coils from fires across the city, corpses litter the streets, and wraiths circle the rooftops like vultures. A sphere of utter darkness grows out from the heart of the city, blotting out the light as it expands toward you. You turn away, and when you look back, the darkness is gone. The city is a half-flooded, overgrown ruin.
>>

While in Omu, the character who saw the vision has the same dark dream whenever he or she takes a long rest. In the dream, the character is standing in the city during its fall and sees a skeletal figure walking alone through the dead streets. He wears tattered robes and holds a skull-tipped staff, and his sunken eyes contain points of dead light. With each dream, the figure (**Acererak**) gets a little closer.

### 18. Nangnang's Shrine

>>Monoliths adorned with prancing, frog-like figures rise from the swamp. Beyond, a ruined edifice shaped like an arrowhead squats in the muddy water. Bushes and trees grow from its roof. At the pointed front of the building, steps ascend to a stone door caked in slime.
>>

The shrine to the trickster god Nangnang (represented by a grung) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods. The water around the shrine is 2 feet deep.

![[059-307.webp|right|300]]

#### 18A. Shrine Entrance
The shrine is home to a gold-skinned **grung elite warrior** named Chief **Yorb**. Four orange-skinned **grung elite warriors** wallow in the flooded courtyard with **Yorb** and his trained **hadrosaurus** mount. One red-skinned **grung wildling** and seven green-skinned **grungs** lurk on the shrine's 20-foot-high rooftop. See *appendix D* for these creatures' statistics.

The grungs on the roof unleash arrows to ward off intruders. If the intruders fight back, more green-skinned **grungs** close in from nearby buildings, with 1d4 appearing at the end of each round until twenty have arrived.

The grungs are jumpy and distrustful of strangers. At first, **Yorb** is more interested in scaring away intruders than he is talking with them. If the characters rescue his favored son in area 5 and have the means to communicate with the chief, **Yorb** opens up to them. He currently has no idea his son is missing.

The grungs worship the dead trickster god Nangnang. If the characters enter into negotiations with **Yorb**, he can recount the full legend of Omu's nine trickster gods (see "Legend of the Nine Gods").

***Shrine Doors.*** The doors to the shrine stand ajar. If the tide of battle turns against Chief **Yorb**, he retreats into the shrine with his elite guards and bars the doors. A character can force open the barred doors with a successful DC 25 Strength check.

#### 18B. Chamber of Greed

>>Torches shed light over rooms filled of treasure: chests heaped with coins, polished amphorae, strings of pearls, and ornate pieces of armor. Set into the floor in front of another double door is a mosaic depicting a frog-like humanoid beating a leopard that has snakes emerging from its shoulders. Cuneiform inscriptions are woven above and below the combatants.
>>

The inscriptions are written in Old Omuan. The one above the mosaic reads, "Nangnang teaches us to serve only ourselves." The inscriptions below tell how Nangnang (a grung) stole a spear belonging to Shagambi (a kamadan). For details, see "Legend of the Nine Gods."

While the treasures remain in the shrine, they look and feel real. If a character removes a treasure from the shrine, the illusion drops and the treasure reverts to its true form: gold coins become disks of tin, silver decanters revert back to clay jugs, and glittering armor becomes rusty scrap metal. A *detect magic* spell reveals that the treasures radiate auras of illusion magic while in the shrine. None of these "treasures" are valuable.

***Locked Doors.*** The stone doors to area 18C are locked, with neither keyhole nor handle. Above the double door, the following message is carved into the stonework in Old Omuan: "Whoever among you is the richest, bring me your gifts." To date, even Chief **Yorb** hasn't learned what lies on the other side of the doors. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the doors. The doors swing open if a creature approaches them while carrying one or more of the treasures found in the shrine. However, if another creature in the shrine is also carrying such treasure, the doors remains closed. A *knock* spell also opens the doors.

#### 18C. Puzzle Cube

>>In the middle of this dusty room, a stone cube rests on a pedestal carved and painted to resemble a squat, humanoid frog.
>>

Nangnang's puzzle cube can be safely removed from its pedestal.

### 19. Obo'laka's Shrine

>>A pair of needlelike columns mark the entrance to a walled ruin. In the courtyard beyond, banyan roots envelop a squat building. The stone doors that seal the entrance are carved with images of snarling bears with long, sharp claws.
>>

The shrine to the trickster god Obo'laka (represented by a zorbo) contains one of nine puzzle cubes needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

#### 19A. Shrine Entrance
A plaque above the shrine's entrance bears the following message in Old Omuan: "Obo'laka teaches us to tread warily and stay in the light." This message sheds light on how to obtain Obo'laka's puzzle cube. The doors are slightly ajar and have rusty hinges that squeal loudly when the doors are opened.

When the characters arrive, four **zorbos** (see *appendix D*) are lurking around the perimeter of the shrine. They investigate the sound of the squealing doors but won't attack large groups, preferring to pick off loners and stragglers.

#### 19B. Gallery of Carvings

>>The walls of this dark corridor are covered with painted reliefs showing Omuan people hunting, harvesting fruit, planting crops, crafting weapons, feasting, fighting, weaving, and skinning animals. Eight empty torch brackets protrude from the walls under the reliefs.
>>

To disarm the puzzle cube trap in area 19E, the magic torches from that room must be placed in the brackets in this hall.

***Barred Secret Door.*** A character who searches the walls and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a secret door just inside the entrance. The door is triple-barred from the west side. It can't be opened manually from this side, though three *knock* spells will do the trick.

#### 19C. Sun Pool

>>A glorious sun is carved on the ceiling, directly above a pool of still water. The ceiling reflected in the pool doesn't show a sun carving, but rather a moon carving.
>>

The pool is a magic portal that connects to the pool in area 19D. Characters who immerse themselves in the pool surface in area 19D.

#### 19D. Moon Pool
If the characters enter this room via the pool, read:

>>A full moon is carved on the ceiling here, directly above the pool. The walls are decorated with reliefs of the Omuan people carrying out daily chores.
>>

The ceiling reflected in the pool doesn't show a moon carving, but rather a sun carving. To travel back to area 19C, a character must duck under the pool's surface.

***Locked Secret Door.*** A secret door in the south wall requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot. Even when found, there's no obvious way to open the door, although a *knock* spell works.

A character who studies the wall reliefs and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check observes that one of the figures on the wall is crafting a key. If the character pushes the key, the secret door pops open, revealing a dusty, web-filled tunnel (area 19F) beyond.

#### 19E. Chamber of Sacraments

>>Eight torches illuminate this room. The light washes over a floor mosaic showing two creatures locked in combat: a small bear with sharp claws and a rabbit with a spiral horn on its forehead. In the middle of the room, a robed figure stands next to a waist-high pedestal, atop which rests a stone cube. The figure is bald and has one hand on the cube. It takes a moment to realize that the figure is a statue.
>>

The floor mosaic shows Obo'laka (a zorbo) fighting I'jin (an almiraj). Inscriptions in Old Omuan underneath the mosaic explain how I'jin ruined Obo'laka's attempt to placate Ubtao (see "Legend of the Nine Gods").

The statue is a petrified Red Wizard (LE male Thayan human **mage**) named Voj. He failed to disarm the puzzle cube trap before touching it, and its magic turned him to stone. If a *greater restoration* spell or similar magic is cast on Voj, he reverts to flesh, realizes he's not alone, and attacks anyone who would deny him the cube.

Voj takes orders from Zagmira and knows the legend of Obo'laka and I'jin. If the characters defeat him, they find some valuables on his person (see "Treasure" below) that aren't obtainable while Voj is petrified.

***Puzzle Cube.*** Any creature that touches the puzzle cube must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be petrified. Even on a success, a creature holding the cube must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns until the puzzle cube is removed from the shrine. When the torches in this room are inserted into the empty brackets in area 19B, Obo'laka's puzzle cube can be handled safely.

***Torches.*** Each torch burns with a flame that never wears its wood down. The torches can be extinguished, but they reignite every time they reenter this chamber. Relighting a torch by any other method proves impossible. If all eight torches are inserted into the empty brackets in area 19B, the puzzle cube can be handled safely.

***Treasure.*** Voj carries an *immovable rod*, a leather pouch containing three tiger eye gemstones (10 gp each), and a red, leather-bound spellbook, which contains all the spells he has prepared.

#### 19F. Secret Passage

>>This dark passage is choked with dust and webs. It's clear that no one has been through here in years.
>>

Traversing this corridor is the easiest way to transport the torches in area 19E to area 19B without dousing their flames in the pools. The secret door leading to area 19B has three wooden bars across it. Once the bars are removed, the door pulls open easily.

### 20. Royal Palace

>>Thousands of bats swirl above a great ruin. Behind a 15-foot-high circular wall, you see crumbling arcades, vine-choked statues, empty plazas, and buildings overgrown with banyan roots. Streets that aren't flooded are choked with rubble.
>>

The palace looks abandoned and has been looted of all treasure. Snakes slithering through the rubble are mostly harmless (but see area 20A and 20B below). The bats flying above the ruin are also harmless.

The Fane of the Night Serpent (see chapter 4) lies under the palace. There are two entrances: a large entrance to the north (area 20A) and a hidden entrance to the south (area 20B). Watching over each entrance are three type 1 **yuan-ti malisons** in snake form. They slither out of hiding, revert to their true forms, and attack anyone who isn't accompanied by yuan-ti.

#### 20A. Main Entrance to the Fane
The north entrance to the Fane of the Night Serpent is easy to find:

>>A worked tunnel descends into the earth here. Muddy cart-tracks wind back and forth from the entrance.
>>

The tunnel slopes down to area 1 of the yuan-ti temple (see chapter 4).

#### 20B. Secret Entrance to the Fane
The south entrance to the Fane of the Night Serpent is hidden behind palms and thorny bushes. Yuan-ti who pass through here always try to cover their tracks. To find the entrance, a character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check while searching the vicinity.

>>Lifting aside the palm fronds, you uncover a narrow, rough-hewn passage descending into the earth.
>>

This passage connects to area 23 of the yuan-ti temple (see chapter 4).

# Chapter 4: Fane of the Night Serpent
![[060-401.webp|right|300]]

Under the ruined palace of Omu lies a yuan-ti temple dedicated to an apocalyptic god known as Dendar the Night Serpent. The temple was originally part of the palace, but the yuan-ti have expanded and modified it to suit their needs over the years. When **Ras Nsi** steals one of Omu's puzzle cubes (see chapter 3), the characters must delve into the temple to recover it. Characters captured by yuan-ti also end up here.

## Schemes of the Yuan-ti
Before running this chapter, review the information on yuan-ti in the Monster Manual. Additional information appears in *Volo's Guide to**Monsters*.

### Ras Nsi
**Ras Nsi** leads the yuan-ti of Omu on a divine mission to usher forth Dendar the Night Serpent and trigger the end of the world (see *appendix D* for more information on **Ras Nsi** and his evil plans). His version of the apocalypse is not imminent, since **Ras Nsi** is distracted with fears of his own mortality. He has fallen victim to the death curse and is growing weaker by the day, and neither he nor his yuan-ti priests have been able to ascertain the cause or find a remedy. As **Ras Nsi**'s power wanes, his rivals are preparing to dispose of him and continue their holy mission.

**Acererak** promised to help the yuan-ti if they would guard the Tomb of the Nine Gods. **Ras Nsi** doesn't know that **Acererak** is playing him for a fool. If the characters convince **Ras Nsi** that **Acererak** is a common enemy, he is of a mind not to stand in their way, provided that they vow to destroy the Soulmonger. Above all else, **Ras Nsi** values his own life.

### Fenthaza
The cruel yuan-ti malison **Fenthaza** is second in power only to **Ras Nsi** and serves as the temple's high priest. As one of Dendar's "nightmare speakers," she interprets the dream visions of the serpent god and pleases her with torture and sacrifice.

**Fenthaza** has long resented **Ras Nsi** for hanging onto the threads of his humanity. Now her visions portend ruin at **Ras Nsi**'s hands, and she actively plots against him. Her dreams have revealed a treasure called the Black Opal Crown, hidden deep within the Tomb of the Nine Gods. She's convinced that the crown is the key to unleashing Dendar the Night Serpent. **Fenthaza** wants to murder **Ras Nsi** and obtain the crown from the tomb. The priest is patient and cunning, and she won't take action against **Ras Nsi** unless the odds are stacked in her favor. Captive characters soon become cat's-paws in **Fenthaza**'s coup.

> ##### Temple Roster and Reinforcements
>If the yuan-ti detect intruders inside the temple who aren't prisoners, they try to ring the loud gong in area 9. The Temple Roster table summarizes the positions of yuan-ti across the lair and indicates how they react when intruders are detected or the gong is struck.
>
>Once an alarm is raised, begin tracking how much time the characters spend in the temple. At the end of each hour, roll percentile dice and consult the Temple Reinforcements table to see what else arrives. Reinforcements enter the temple from area 1 or 23 and behave as you desire.
>
>The temple is a living community. Outside combat, inhabitants move between chambers, feed, wash, rest, and engage in all the villainous deceptions of yuan-ti life. You can use the Temple Reinforcements table to simulate this.
>

## Getting Inside
The two entrances to the yuan-ti temple are located amid the ruins of Omu's royal palace (see chapter 3, area 20). Map 4.1 provides an overview of the temple. The main entrance leads to area 1 on the map, and the secret entrance leads to area 23.

Adventurers are most likely to enter the temple as infiltrators or captives. If they've forged an alliance with the Red Wizards in chapter 3, they'll be looking for Zagmira's spy in the temple harem (area 10).

### Infiltrating the Temple
Human characters can pose as yuan-ti purebloods if they dress and act appropriately, and can even lead other characters into the temple as captives. They must bluff their way past the yuan-ti guards. Malisons are the easiest to fool: their inherent disdain for the lower strata of yuan-ti society means that they pay little heed to purebloods moving through the temple.

The temple denizens have racial tics that are difficult to mimic and they speak in a patois that combines the Common and Draconic tongues. To avoid drawing suspicion when talking, a human character pretending to be a yuan-ti pureblood must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check.

Nonhumans have a much harder time fooling the yuan-ti without the aid of magic. Nonhuman characters attempting to pose as yuan-ti purebloods have disadvantage on any ability checks made to act in disguise.

### Captured by the Yuan-ti
Characters captured by the yuan-ti are stripped of their gear, fitted with manacles (one set binding the wrists and another binding the ankles), and confined to the pits in area 8. Their gear is stored in area 13 until it can be studied and inventoried by the storeroom's guardian, Azi Mas. If the characters don't escape within 1 hour, they are visited by the yuan-ti spymaster Yahru and his bodyguards (see area 17). Yahru asks questions about their mission. He and his bodyguards then escort the characters to **Ras Nsi** or **Fenthaza**.

Yahru enjoys political games and uses the characters to play **Ras Nsi** and **Fenthaza** against one another. If the characters answered Yahru's questions angrily or arrogantly, they are taken to **Ras Nsi**. If they reacted in a calm, civil manner, they are brought to **Fenthaza**.

#### Audience with Ras Nsi
**Ras Nsi** meets with prisoners in the throne room (area 11). He wants to know why the characters invaded Omu. If he finds their answer unsatisfactory, he views them as dangerous and has them put to death immediately. If **Ras Nsi** learns that they've come to put an end to the death curse, he is intrigued. If they reveal that the cause lies in the Tomb of the Nine Gods, he releases them, gives them any remaining puzzle cubes they need to enter the tomb, and grants them safe passage out of Omu if they succeed in destroying the Soulmonger. He won't help them further, since that could incite a yuan-ti revolt.

#### Audience with Fenthaza
**Fenthaza** meets with prisoners in her quarters (area 5). She sees the characters as pawns in her plot to overthrow **Ras Nsi**. To determine whether they can be trusted, she assigns them to work as slaves under Slavemaster Issar (area 19). Issar assigns each character a labor, determined by rolling percentile dice and consulting the Slave Labors table. (More than one character can be given the same task.) As they perform labors, characters see how the temple functions and might find ways to escape.

If the characters perform their labors without incident or complaint for 1 day, they are brought before **Fenthaza** once more. She promises them their freedom if they agree to overthrow **Ras Nsi**. She also allows them to keep any puzzle cubes in **Ras Nsi**'s custody. If they agree, she gives them the armory passphrases (see area 4) and encourages them to carry out a slave uprising. She also offers to ritually transform human characters into yuan-ti purebloods so they can get closer to **Ras Nsi** (see area 9). While the characters sow confusion, she assembles her guards and priests (see areas 6 and 7), ambushes **Ras Nsi**, and attempts to kill him.

If the coup is thwarted, **Fenthaza** and her confederates are put to death. If the coup succeeds, **Fenthaza** concludes that the characters have outlived their usefulness and tries to eliminate them. If the characters flee before she can betray them, **Fenthaza** sends her air elemental (see area 5) to hunt them down and kill them.

#### Slave Labors

| d100 | Labor | Development |
|:---:|---|---|
| 01–15 | Muck out the dinosaur pen in area 2. | The character learns that Nahth (area 1) is susceptible to bribery. |
| 16–40 | Help Azi Mas rearrange the contents of the storeroom (area 13). | Azi Mas shares his suspicions that **Fenthaza** is planning a coup. |
| 41–60 | Assist Xopal in the poison distillery (area 14). | Xopal sends the character, unescorted, to gather fungi from area 22. |
| 61–75 | Scrub the yuan-ti bathing in area 16. | The character learns that **Fenthaza** had a prophetic dream about the Black Opal Crown, a treasure which the yuan-ti believe has the power to usher forth Dendar the Night Serpent. |
| 76–90 | Clean the yuan-ti nests in area 18. | The character overhears one yuan-ti whisper to another, in Common, "White feather, black mask." See area 4 for the significance of these words. |
| 91–00 | Feed a dead prisoner to the hydra in area 21. | The characters find a folded-up piece of parchment hidden on the dead prisoner. On one side, it bears a crude map of the temple. |

#### Temple Roster

| Area | Creature(s) | Notes |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | Nahth (**type 1 yuan-ti malison**), 4 **yuan-ti broodguards**, 3 **swarms of poisonous snakes** | The yuan-ti remain here, pulling reinforcements from area 2. The swarms are confined to the pits. |

| 20 | 4 **yuan-ti broodguards** | The yuan-ti guard the secret entrance. If combat erupts, one of them flees to area 19 to alert the yuan-ti there. Intruders caught trying to sneak past the guards are taken to area 19 for questioning. |
| 21 | 1 **hydra** | The hydra attacks swimmers as well as creatures that travel north of area 18. If a rowboat bell is rung, the hydra appears in 1d6 rounds and attacks unless it is properly fed. |

#### Temple Reinforcements

| d100 | Creature(s) |
|:---:|---|
| 01–15 | 1d4 **yuan-ti purebloods** escorting a **type 3 yuan-ti malison**. |
| 16–30 | 1d4 + 1 **yuan-ti purebloods** escorting 2d4 captives (male and female Chultan human **commoners** of any alignment). |
| 31–45 | 2d4 **yuan-ti purebloods** returning to the temple from an expedition or patrol. |
| 46–60 | 4 **yuan-ti broodguards** (see *appendix D*) carrying a **type 2 yuan-ti malison** on a litter. |
| 61–70 | 1 **yuan-ti malison** returning to the temple. Roll a d6 to determine its type: 1–2, type 1; 3–4, type 2; 5–6, type 3. |
| 71–75 | 1 **yuan-ti abomination** arriving at the temple to challenge **Ras Nsi**'s leadership. If **Fenthaza** is alive, she uses her influence to arrange a showdown between **Ras Nsi** and the abomination in the fane (area 9). If **Fenthaza** is incapacitated or dead, the abomination bullies its way to **Ras Nsi**'s throne room (area 11), where it is killed. |
| 76–85 | 2d4 insane **cult fanatics** (NE male and female humans of mixed ethnicities) seeking an audience with **Ras Nsi**, to pledge their devotion to Dendar the Night Serpent. The cult fanatics bring tribute in the form of treasure (roll once on the Treasure Hoard: Challenge 0–4 table in *chapter 7* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). |
| 86–00 | 2d6 **tribal warriors** (N male and female Chultan humans) delivering tribute to **Ras Nsi**. This tribute consists of food, drink, and treasure (roll once on the Treasure Hoard: Challenge 0–4 table in *chapter 7* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). |

## Locations in the Temple
Map 4.1 shows the layout of the entire temple. The following features are common throughout.

#### Ceilings
Unless otherwise noted, chamber ceilings are 20 feet high and corridor ceilings are 10 feet high.

#### Doors
Doors are made from worked stone, with 4-inch-wide holes spaced along their bottoms to allow Medium and smaller snakes to pass through. Doors are unlocked unless noted otherwise.

#### Illumination
Oil lamps provide dim light throughout the complex. Each lamp burns with a tall green flame as bright as torchlight.

#### Portcullises
Iron portcullises secure certain areas of the temple. The bars of a portcullis are 1 inch thick and spaced 4 inches apart. A portcullis can be raised or lowered using an iron lever nearby. If the lever can't be reached, the portcullis can be forced up or down by characters with a combined Strength of 30 or more, but doing so breaks the mechanisms that keep the portcullis from dropping. A *knock* spell also raises a closed portcullis.

#### Ramps
In place of stairs, the temple has stone ramps, which snake-bodied yuan-ti find much easier to climb.

#### Teleporters
**Ras Nsi** created five magical teleporters (in areas 8 through 12) that no one else is permitted to use. Each looks like a raised, faintly glowing stone disk with a serpentine glyph carved into the top of it. Each disk radiates an aura of conjuration magic under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell.

If **Ras Nsi** steps onto one of these disks, he can continue his movement from any other disk in the temple. A character with proficiency in the Arcana skill can do the same thing by stepping onto the teleporter and succeeding on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds but the character has no destination disk in mind, he or she appears atop a randomly determined one.

### 1. Main Gate
If characters approach this area from the north, read:

>>A wide passage slopes down to a set of bronze doors. Coiled serpents decorate the metal, with a sliding hatch at head height. Four-inch-wide holes pierce the base of each door.
>>

When opened, the bronze doors slide into wall niches to either side of the tunnel. To pull the doors apart, the yuan-ti broodguards under Nahth's command tug on heavy chains on the south side of the gate. To bypass the doors without opening them, yuan-ti malisons transform into snakes and slither through the holes at the bottom of the doors.

A **type 1 yuan-ti malison** named Nahth (pronounced NAWTH) and four **yuan-ti broodguards** (see *appendix D*) defend the main gate. Strangers are denied entry unless they are accompanied by one or more yuan-ti.

Nahth is greedy. After allowing characters to pass through the gate, he demands a bribe in the form of food (preferably meat) or treasure (minimum 10 gp). If the characters refuse to pay up, Nahth picks a fight with them. Combat here draws reinforcements from area 2.

#### Snake Pits
Beyond the main gate are three pits covered with iron grates. When enemies attack, the broodguards remove the grated covers and form up in a defensive line on the south side of the open pits. Each pit is 5 feet across, 10 feet deep, and filled with a **swarm of poisonous snakes**. The walls of each pit are too smooth to climb without the aid of gear or magic. A creature can skirt around the edge of a pit with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check but falls if the check fails. A creature can also attempt to clear the pits with a standing jump or running jump (see the *Player's Handbook* for jumping rules), provided there are no broodguards lined up along the far side.

#### Treasure
Nahth has a crocodile skin pouch containing 28 gp and wears gold ceremonial bracers sculpted to resemble bats (150 gp for the pair).

### 2. Hall of War

>>Four pillars carved with serpent reliefs support the 20-foot-high ceiling of this large room, in the middle of which is an 18-foot-high statue of a coiled cobra, facing north. Torches with green flames flicker on the walls, and the air reeks of dung. Two wagons are parked in one corner, and a triceratops is confined to a metal pen in another. To the west are a pair of dark alcoves, and to the south is a wide, pillared hall.
>>

Yuan-ti troops muster in this hall before heading into the city. Unless they have been drawn elsewhere, a **yuan-ti pureblood** named Soakosh (pronounced SOH-kawsh) and four **yuan-ti broodguards** (see *appendix D*) are stationed here. Two **basilisks** chained to hooks in the western alcoves are trained not to look their yuan-ti masters in the eye. Chewed bits of stone (the remains of petrified victims) litter the floor in the alcoves. The **triceratops** confined to the metal pen in the northwest corner is docile until threatened. The yuan-ti use it to pull supply wagons.

Soakosh is fat and has a forked tongue. He's rarely seen without a bag of his favorite food at hand: candied grung eggs.

If the alarm is raised, Soakosh commands the broodguards to unchain the basilisks from their hooks and lead them into battle like war hounds. If the alarm has not been raised but combat ensues here, one broodguard runs to sound the gong in area 9.

If the triceratops is threatened with fire or injured by an attack, it smashes through the walls of its pen and heads toward area 1.

#### Giant Cobra Statue
The statue is not dangerous. A character can climb it with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Wagons
The supply wagons in the northeast corner are empty.

### 3. Hall of Serpents

>>The walls of this pillared hall bear reliefs of a giant serpent and its yuan-ti worshipers doing terrible things.
>>

The wall reliefs show the legend of Dendar the Night Serpent and the rise of **Ras Nsi**. Characters who examine them see the following tableaus:

- A giant serpent coils in the underworld, devouring the dreams of sleeping creatures.
- Yuan-ti terrorize Chultans, feeding their nightmares to the great serpent.
- A yuan-ti malison (**Ras Nsi**) wielding a flaming sword and wearing a gold crown set with a black opal leads the snake people to a great door to the underworld.
- The door to the underworld opens, releasing the serpent. It devours the sun and plunges the world into terror and darkness.

A character who searches the reliefs and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers that the black opal in **Ras Nsi**'s crown is a stone button. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also sees tiny holes hidden among the scales of the Night Serpent carvings.

If a character presses the button in **Ras Nsi**'s crown, the carvings of the Night Serpent expel a soporific gas that fills the hallway and lingers for 1 minute. Any creature that moves into the gas or starts its turn inside it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The gas has no effect on creatures that cannot be poisoned, and creatures that fail the save fall unconscious for 1 hour. Using cloth or wax, characters can plug the hundreds of holes and prevent the gas from flowing out.

### 4. Armory
The armory door has an *arcane lock* spell cast on it. Officially, only **Ras Nsi**, **Sekelok**, and **Fenthaza** know the command phrase to bypass the spell ("white feather"). Speaking the command phrase while standing within 5 feet of the door suppresses its magic for 1 minute, during which time the door can be opened normally. The door can also be forced open with a *knock* spell or a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.

When the characters peer inside, read:

>>Gleaming scimitars, serpent helms, and suits of scale armor cram the racks of this vault. Large bones and horned skulls litter the floor, and a shield made from the shell of a tortoise hangs on the far wall.
>>
>>A large skeletal serpent slithers out from behind the racks, raises its head, and says in Common, "They will tell us the passphrase! So Ukurlahmu has spoken."
>>

A **bone naga** named Ukurlahmu (pronounced oo-ker-LAH-moo) has orders to protect the armory from thieves, but it struggles to remember faces. It only attacks creatures who fail to speak the correct passphrase. The current passphrase is "black mask." Characters are given three chances to utter the correct phrase before Ukurlahmu attacks. Before it attacks, the naga uses a bonus action to speak a magic command word that causes two **minotaur skeletons** to rise from the bones on the floor. The skeletons obey the naga.

Ukurlahmu speaks strangely. When it asks a question or makes a demand, it prefaces every sentence with "It will..." or "They will..." (for example, "It will tell us why it is here and what it wants"). When it makes a statement or answers a question, it always ends its sentences with "... so Ukurlahmu has spoken."

#### Treasure
The armory contains ten suits of scale armor, fifty scimitars, twenty longbows, twenty shortbows, and fifty quivers containing twenty arrows each. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the shield hanging on the wall. The shield has a minor magical property: words spoken by the shield's bearer are amplified and sound ten times louder than normal.

The tortoise-shell shield belongs to **Sekelok**, and only he is allowed to touch it. If a character removes the shield from the wall, Ukurlahmu coldly demands that it be returned it to its hook, attacking if this instruction is ignored.

### 5. Fenthaza's Quarters
Two **type 2 yuan-ti malisons** stand guard in the corridor outside this room. Combat in the hallway alerts the yuan-ti broodguards in area 6, which arrive in 1 round. The room can be described as follows:

>>A haze of incense lingers inside the chamber. Faded murals decorate the walls, and throw rugs and cushions lie scattered on the floor. An engraved chest rests in one corner next to a stone urn covered with snake carvings. A creature with the head and upper body of a dark-skinned woman and the lower body of a serpent coils in the middle of the room.
>>

![[063-403.webp|right|300]]

**Fenthaza**, a **yuan-ti nightmare speaker** (see *appendix D*), lairs here. If an alarm is raised, **Fenthaza** relies on her guards to protect her while she releases the creature trapped in the stone urn (see below). **Fenthaza** tries to incapacitate interlopers and confine them to area 8. A particularly irksome foe might be shackled to the altar in area 6, where she can torture it at her leisure.

One of the more powerful figures in the temple, **Fenthaza** ruled the yuan-ti after their abomination leader died, and she performed the ritual that transformed **Ras Nsi** into a malison. Recently, her visions have led her to doubt **Ras Nsi**'s capabilities. In turn, **Ras Nsi** has started to cede power to his champion, **Sekelok** (area 12).

#### Stone Urn
The stone urn stands 4 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds. Its stone lid weighs 25 pounds. Trapped within the urn is an **air elemental** that obeys **Fenthaza**. If the urn's lid is removed by someone other than **Fenthaza**, the elemental flies out and attacks.

**Fenthaza** uses the elemental to hunt down and slay escaped prisoners. Once it has completed its task, the elemental always returns to its mistress.

#### Treasure
**Fenthaza** carries a ring of keys that unlock the manacles and shackles worn by the prisoners in area 8. She wears a holy symbol of Dendar the Night Serpent (25 gp) around her neck.

The chest is unlocked and contains 200 gp, a black leather quiver embroidered with a quartz-studded star map (75 gp), and a ceremonial dagger in a gold scabbard embossed with a scene of stampeding jungle animals (25 gp).

### 6. Sacrificial Chamber
Unless they are lured to area 5 by sounds of battle, four **yuan-ti broodguards** (see *appendix D*) stand guard in this chamber, one in each corner.

>>A bloodstained altar stands in the middle of this room. It has shackles bolted to its top and niches carved into its sides. Housed in each niche is a human skull. Grooves run down the altar to gutters on the floor, allowing spilled blood to drain into the walls. Clay urns overflow with wet bones and gore.
>>

**Fenthaza** routinely sacrifices prisoners on the altar. As they die, their blood drains into the pool in area 9. A captured character who insults or otherwise annoys **Fenthaza** might end up here, shackled to the altar.

#### Chanting Skulls
The altar has six niches (one at each end and two on each long side). The human skull in each niche radiates an aura of abjuration magic under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell. If combat ensues here, the skulls start to chant in Abyssal. The skulls stop chanting when they are removed from their niches or when combat ends. Each skull has AC 9, 1 hit point, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. As long as one or more skulls are chanting, all yuan-ti in the room gain the following benefits:

- Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks
- Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects

#### Portcullis
A portcullis seals the entrance to area 8. A bronze lever is set into the wall south of the gate, out of sight of area 8. Lifting the lever raises the portcullis, and pulling the lever down causes the portcullis to drop.

### 7. Evil Oracle

>>Steam rises from a stone basin filled with viscous black and purple liquid. Three serpentine creatures surround the pool. Each has the head and upper body of a dark-skinned woman and the lower body of a snake.
>>

**Yuan-ti priests** use the pool to commune with Dendar the Night Serpent. Three priests named Arakiti, Kultha, and Nyss are here at all times. They are loyal to **Fenthaza** and are **type 3 yuan-ti malisons**, with these changes:

- Add the following to the list of spells that the yuan-ti can innately cast at will: *eldritch blast* (2 beams; +5 to hit; 1d10 + 3 force damage per beam), *minor illusion*, and *poison spray*.
- They don't carry longbows.

#### Oracle Pool
The sludge within the pool conducts the reveries of Dendar the Night Serpent. A creature that enters the sludge or starts its turn in the pool takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage.

Any creature that gazes into the pool for more than a few seconds receives a brief, nightmarish vision. In this vision, the creature is being swallowed whole by a giant snake. When the vision ends, the creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and is afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "*Madness*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

> ##### Prisoners of the Yuan-ti
>Yuan-ti captives not put to work as slaves are imprisoned in cells until they can be sacrificed to Dendar the Night Serpent. Ten sample prisoners are described below, and you can create others. All prisoners wear manacles on their wrists and ankles (see area 8 for details). They've been stripped of their armor and weapons unless noted otherwise. All seek to escape the temple and make their way back to their homes or return to civilization.
>
>- Tahvo, a ten-year-old boy (LG male Chultan human noncombatant with AC 10 and 2 hit points), wears a flower garland and prays constantly to Tymora.
>- Sev, a **yuan-ti pureblood** who looks human except for his forked tongue, is suffering the effects of blue mist fever (see "Diseases") and throws stones at illusory blue monkeys only he can see.
>- Oloma Authdamar (CG female Turami human **scout**) is a former crew member of the Star Goddess (see chapter 2). She leapt from a porthole as the ship crashed, and the yuan-ti captured her in the jungle. Oloma carries a concealed dagger.
>- Pottery Shard, a **tabaxi minstrel** (see *appendix D*), was kidnapped while traveling from Port Nyanzaru to Fort Beluarian.
>- Gorvax, a **firenewt warrior** (see *appendix D*) is eager to escape and return to the Valley of Lost Honor.
>- A Harper named Lomar Dral (LG male Turami human **mage** with no spell slots remaining). While searching for **Artus Cimber** in Port Nyanzaru, he was drugged by the yuan-ti guide **Salida** and woke up a prisoner in Omu.
>- Mung, a Batiri goblin, was caught by the yuan-ti while foraging in the jungle. He is malnourished and suffers from 3 levels of exhaustion (see appendix A of the Player's Handbook).
>- Kanush Natombe (N male Chultan human **tribal warrior**) foolishly traveled to Omu to prove his worth to another man. Kanush is malnourished and suffers from 4 levels of exhaustion.
>- Zilla Atazi (LE female Chultan human **bandit**) was a pirate aboard the Dragonfang. Captain **Elok Jaharwon** threw Zilla overboard for insubordination. The yuan-ti captured her after she washed ashore.

### 8. Prisoner Pits
An iron portcullis seals this chamber. The lever to raise it is located in area 6.

Characters captured by the yuan-ti are confined here. If this is how the characters first arrive, read:

>>The stench of sweat fills the humid air. You are chained to the wall of a dank, partially flooded pit. Other prisoners whimper nearby, lit by faint torchlight from the hole above.
>>

If characters peer into this room through the portcullis, use this description instead:

>>Muffled sobs and moans rise from four pits with circular iron grates covering them. A chain hooked to each grate stretches over a pulley bolted to the ceiling and coils around an iron winch set into a nearby wall. Iron manacles dangle from hooks on the south wall. To the north, a faintly glowing stone disk covers the floor of an otherwise empty alcove, and carved into the top of the disk is a serpentine symbol.
>>

The room contains four pits, each one a bell-shaped chamber 10 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter. The pits are flooded to a depth of 3 feet. Covering each pit is a 600-pound circular iron grate that requires one or more characters with a combined Strength score of at least 20 to lift. Alternatively, a character can use the iron winch near each pit to lift or lower its lid with a successful DC 12 Strength check. Climbing the slippery, sloped walls of a pit requires a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.

New prisoners are slapped in chains and dropped into a random pit. The yuan-ti strip all prisoners of their belongings, which are kept in the storeroom (area 13) until they are properly inventoried. If the yuan-ti need to get a prisoner out of the pit, they disconnect a hook from the lid and use it to hoist the prisoner out by the manacles.

Each pit contains 1d3 prisoners, and the "*Prisoners of the Yuan-ti*" sidebar describes several. If a player character dies, you could introduce a replacement character here as a prisoner hoping to be rescued.

Prisoners are forced to wear manacles on their wrists and shackles on their ankles. The manacles impose disadvantage on ability checks made to climb or swim. The shackles reduce a prisoner's walking speed by half and impose disadvantage on ability checks made to jump. **Fenthaza** (see area 5) carries the keys for these bindings. See "*Adventuring Gear*" in chapter 5 of the *Player's Handbook* for rules on breaking, escaping, and unlocking manacles (and shackles).

#### Teleporter
The engraved stone disk in the northern alcove is one of **Ras Nsi**'s magic teleporters (see "Teleporters").

### 9. The Fane

>>An underground cathedral opens before you. At one end, a sculptured balcony perches atop five rearing stone serpents. Blood dribbling from the serpents' jaws falls into a semicircular basin, and from there flows along a sloped trough into a wide stone bowl set into the floor. South of the bowl is a mezzanine, prominently situated atop which is a cauldron of steaming broth that exudes fleshy odors. To the west, a huge gong carved with snake patterns stands on a second balcony.
>>

During rituals, the fane swells with yuan-ti, but the room is unguarded otherwise. When struck, the gong can be heard throughout the temple complex. One strike announces the start of a serpent ritual: when sounded, all the yuan-ti within the temple complex arrive here within half an hour. Two or more strikes in quick succession signal an alarm: when sounded, yuan-ti throughout the temple converge on this location as quickly as possible (see the Temple Roster table).

#### Blood Pool
Blood spilled in area 6 is channeled into this room, and the central pool contains 3d6 inches of viscid, days-old blood from previous sacrifices. The yuan-ti wallow in the blood from time to time, and slaves are sometimes brought here to be eaten alive by crazed revelers or transformed into yuan-ti (see "Yuan-ti Rituals" below).

#### Cauldron
A stew made from boiled flesh sloshes inside the cauldron, which is heated by a volcanic vent in the floor underneath it. Upturning the cauldron is an action that requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. When the cauldron is tipped, each creature on the floor within a 15-foot cone of the cauldron must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### North Balcony and Teleporter
**Ras Nsi** and **Fenthaza** use the north balcony to address underlings. To climb up, a character must succeed on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. The balustrades around the balcony provide half cover against ranged attacks originating from the room below.

Set into the back wall is an alcove with an engraved stone disk on the floor—one of **Ras Nsi**'s magic teleporters (see "Teleporters").

#### Portcullis
A portcullis seals the entrance to area 10. A bronze lever is set into the wall north of the gate, out of sight of area 10. Lifting the lever raises the portcullis, and pulling the lever down causes the portcullis to drop.

#### Yuan-ti Rituals
Once every ten days, the yuan-ti gather in the fane for a depraved ritual. The ceremony takes place over the course of one night, with a skeleton crew guarding the rest of the temple complex during these periods.

During the ritual, mesmerizing incense is burned in the wall sconces. (See area 13 for more information on the incense.) **Fenthaza** preaches to the congregation from the north balcony. As the ceremony reaches fever pitch, she joins the revelers in the blood pool to feast on the slaves before slithering back to her quarters. On occasion, human slaves are transformed into yuan-ti purebloods or broodguards during these rituals. To undergo the change, slaves must bathe with snakes in the blood of sacrificial victims while under the influence of temple drugs. The transformation leaves each slave with 1d6 levels of exhaustion. Once they've shed their old skin, those who survive the process are taken to their new home in the yuan-ti nests (area 18) to recuperate. Those who die are fed to the hydra in area 21.

**Fenthaza** can arrange for captured human characters to be transformed into yuan-ti purebloods so they can roam freely within the temple complex and get closer to **Ras Nsi**. The transformation can be undone only by a *wish* spell or divine intervention. Characters who survive it gain a random form of indefinite madness (see "*Madness*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). A human that undergoes and survives the ritual retains its traits and gains the following yuan-ti racial traits.

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** You know the *poison spray* cantrip. You can cast *animal friendship* an unlimited number of times with this trait, but you can target only snakes with it. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast *suggestion* with this trait. Once you cast it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

***Magic Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Poison Immunity.*** You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.

### 10. Harem
An iron portcullis seals the entrance to this chamber. To raise it, a creature must lift a lever in area 9.

>>A fountain of cool water bubbles on the floor ahead. The scent of lilies fills the air, and silken drapes drift lazily in the heat. Archways open into shaded booths heaped with cushions and trays of sugared sweets. Lounging about are a dozen scantily clad humanoids with eyes like those of snakes and scaly patches on their arms, legs, necks, and backs. Watching over them are a pair of inhuman bipedal reptiles.
>>

**Ras Nsi**'s concubines live in luxury within these chambers. Eleven **yuan-ti purebloods** and a **doppelganger** disguised as a pureblood comprise the harem. Two **yuan-ti broodguards** (see *appendix D*) watch over the harem at all hours.

**Ras Nsi** used to spend much of his time here, sampling the harem's delights. Since the death curse took hold of him, he has cloistered himself elsewhere. The purebloods neither help nor hinder the characters, and they fear **Ras Nsi** enough not to betray him willingly. Despite **Ras Nsi**'s efforts to hide the effects of the death curse, the concubines know that he is sick and dying.

**Ras Nsi**'s yuan-ti champion, **Sekelok** (area 11), is fascinated by the concubine Neema and courts disaster by visiting her in the dead of night. Neema browbeats the other concubines to cover up her affair.

#### Doppelganger Spy
The doppelganger infiltrated the temple by killing and assuming the form of a male yuan-ti pureblood named Ishmakahl (pronounced ISH-mah-kawl). It has been sent by Zagmira, a Red Wizard, to spy on **Ras Nsi**. Unfortunately for its employers, the doppelganger has had little contact with **Ras Nsi** since arriving at the fane; however, it has learned a few things by eavesdropping on **Sekelok** and Neema's intimate conversations.

Ishmakahl appears as a handsome Chultan man with eyes like a snake's. If the characters make contact with the doppelganger on behalf of the Red Wizards, it offers to help them steal any puzzle cubes from **Ras Nsi**'s lair (area 12). Ishmakahl knows the layout of the temple and knows there's a secret door somewhere in the throne room (area 11) that leads to **Ras Nsi**'s lair. The doppelganger also knows that **Ras Nsi**'s lair can be reached via the fane's teleporters, though it doesn't know how to activate them. It advises the characters to break into the lair when **Sekelok** next visits the harem.

Ishmakahl is secretly contemplating a defection to the yuan-ti. If its plan shows any signs of backfiring, the doppelganger reveals itself to **Ras Nsi** or **Sekelok**, and warns him about the intruders.

#### Teleporter
The eastern booth contains an alcove, set into the floor of which is a faintly glowing stone disk engraved with a serpentine symbol. This is one of **Ras Nsi**'s magic teleporters (see "Teleporters").

#### Treasure
Characters who loot these chambers gain the following treasures: a white gold tiara made from two intertwined vipers with topaz eyes (750 gp), a jade trinket box shaped like a flytrap with curling golden leaves (250 gp), and two golden cobra candlesticks (75 gp each).

### 11. Throne Room

>>Four pillars support the vaulted ceiling, and steps ascend to an iron throne carved in the likeness of a hydra. Painted on the wall behind it is a large blue triangle. To the south, an engraved stone disk is set into the floor of an alcove. A ten-foot-wide opening in the east wall leads to a flooded cave.
>>

Circumstances determine this room's occupants:

- During the day, **Ras Nsi** (see *appendix D*) "sits" in the throne while addressing two **type 1 yuan-ti malisons** who routinely advise him. Standing guard in the middle of the room is **Ras Nsi**'s champion, **Sekelok** (see below), and three **yuan-ti broodguards** (see *appendix D*). Hidden behind the throne are four **ghouls** that obey **Ras Nsi**'s commands. Each ghoul has a blue triangle tattooed on its forehead.
- At night, **Ras Nsi** retires to area 12, leaving the other yuan-ti (including **Sekelok**) and the ghouls here. **Sekelok** sometimes sneaks off to the harem (area 10).
- If the gong in area 9 is struck, **Sekelok** and the other yuan-ti leave to investigate while the ghouls hide behind the throne and **Ras Nsi** withdraws to area 12.

#### Sekelok
**Sekelok** is a tall, muscular yuan-ti pureblood. He has the statistics of a **champion** (see *appendix D*), with these changes:

- **Sekelok** is neutral evil.
- He wears no armor, but his scales are as hard as steel (AC 18).
- He is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.
- He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- He speaks Abyssal, Common, and Draconic.
- He has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- He has the Innate Spellcasting trait described below.

>***Innate Spellcasting.*** **Sekelok**'s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

>- At will: *animal friendship* (snakes only), *poison spray*
>- 3/day: *suggestion*

**Sekelok** is **Ras Nsi**'s trusted bodyguard and takes grim pleasure in slaughtering his master's enemies. **Ras Nsi** delights in forcing those who offend him to duel **Sekelok**, either to the first cut or to the death.

**Sekelok** has a secret affair with Neema, one of **Ras Nsi**'s concubines (see area 10). His motivations here are confused: while he remains staunchly loyal to **Ras Nsi**, the subterfuge fuels his ego. If **Ras Nsi** discovers the affair, he flays both parties alive for their betrayal and feeds them to his pet hydra (see area 21).

#### Secret Door
A secret door in the western corner of the north wall leads to **Ras Nsi**'s lair (area 12). To locate the secret door, a character must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check while searching the walls. If the characters have been told about the secret door, they gain advantage on the skill check.

#### Teleporter
The engraved stone disk in the southern alcove is one of **Ras Nsi**'s magic teleporters (see "Teleporters").

### 12. Ras Nsi's Lair

>>Shadows dance over this opulent bedchamber. Cushions lie in one corner, and decorative shields line the walls. Treasures are heaped around the room: gold and silver coins; a gilded harp; a jeweled wine flask; pillows of silk; and fine clothes draped over wooden mannequins. To the east, an engraved stone disk is set into the floor of an alcove. To the west, a rectangular steel plate mounted on the wall is polished to a mirror-like sheen.
>>

At night, **Ras Nsi** (see *appendix D*) rests here, weakened by the death curse that is slowly consuming him. If enemies corner **Ras Nsi**, shields leap from the walls to protect him (see "Flying Shields" below). During waking hours, **Ras Nsi** returns here only if he's in danger.

If the characters defeat **Ras Nsi** and question him, he reveals the following information to save his skin:

- **Ras Nsi** is slowly rotting to death. He doesn't know the cause of his affliction and has no way to cure it.
- Before he dies, **Ras Nsi** wants to bring forth Dendar the Night Serpent and destroy the world.
- The yuan-ti believe there's a locked gate somewhere under the Peaks of Flame that prevents the Dendar from entering the world. **Acererak** has promised to help **Ras Nsi** unlock the gate and bring forth the Night Serpent. In return, **Ras Nsi** defends the Tomb of the Nine Gods.
- Nine stone puzzle cubes are needed to enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods. **Ras Nsi** doesn't know how to use the cubes to unlock the tomb.
- The tomb entrance is marked with an obelisk. (**Ras Nsi** can provide directions and/or an escort.)
- **Acererak** slew the nine gods of Omu before enslaving the city's inhabitants, which he used to build his tomb.

#### Flying Shields
As a bonus action, **Ras Nsi** can speak a command word ("Ssilum") that causes five shields to fly off the walls and levitate around him. While they're active, **Ras Nsi** gains a +10 bonus to his AC. If an attack that would normally hit **Ras Nsi** is blocked by the shields, one of the shields is struck and disabled as it falls to the floor, reducing **Ras Nsi**'s bonus to AC by 2. When there are no more active shields, the effect ends, and **Ras Nsi** can't use this power again until he finishes a long rest. A *detect magic* or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the shields. Only **Ras Nsi** can activate the shields, and the effect is confined to this room.

#### Teleporter
The engraved stone disk in the eastern alcove is one of **Ras Nsi**'s magic teleporters (see "Teleporters").

#### Treasure
**Ras Nsi** wields a *flame tongue* longsword and carries a *sending stone*. The companion stone is in **Salida's** possession (see "Finding a Guide").

**Ras Nsi**'s lair contains treasures from distant lands. The collection includes a Sembian wine flask (50 gp), a bejeweled Amnian doublet with matching money pouch (75 gp), a fine Cormyrean cloak (100 gp), a gilded Moonshae harp (250 gp), and three large cushions covered in Turami silk (25 gp each). Hidden under one of the cushions is **Ras Nsi**'s leather-bound spellbook, which contains all the spells he has prepared (see *appendix D*). In addition, his hoard contains thirty 50 gp gemstones in a clay urn, 150 pp in an unlocked wooden chest, 350 gp and 900 sp scattered on the floor, and a froghemoth statuette made of painted wood with three amethyst gemstones for eyes (100 gp each).

***Puzzle Cubes.*** If **Ras Nsi** has taken one or more puzzle cubes from the shrines of Omu, they can be found among the items in his hoard.

### 13. Storeroom
The southwest double door is locked. Using thieves' tools, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

>>Stacks of sturdy wood crates, bundles of cloth, and clay amphorae litter the floor.
>>

Supplies gathered from the world above are stored in this chamber. An awakened **giant constrictor snake** named Azi Mas serves as custodian for the provisions. When fresh goods arrive, Azi Mas personally checks them and mentally catalogs them. The rest of the time, he remains coiled in the shadows. The snake is bored and enjoys chatting with yuan-ti visitors. Should other creatures enter from the southwest, Azi Mas ambushes them and tries to take a hostage. If outmatched, he whines and pleads for mercy.

Long ago, a jungle druid used an *awaken* spell on Azi Mas, giving him an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak Common. After serving him for the duration of the enchantment, the serpent slithered off and found its way to Omu. Azi Mas has a good memory; he can remember names and faces and is quick to warn his masters if yuan-ti pass through whom he hasn't seen before.

#### Treasure
The storeroom contains fifty bolts of cloth; six crates of bronze bars; three barrels of salt and spices; and three chests containing rope, oil, lanterns, paper, and blankets. From the supplies, characters can assemble enough gear to make five explorer's packs.

***Mesmerizing Incense.*** Also present is a sealed case containing ten blocks of temple incense. Lighting a block creates a hazy cloud that fills a 20-foot-diameter sphere and moves with the block. Any creature that starts its turn in the cloud and breathes the air must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or fall into a dreamlike stupor laced with nightmarish visions. Though it remains awake, the creature is poisoned. Even yuan-ti are vulnerable to this effect, which lasts for 1 hour after a creature leaves the cloud, or until it receives a *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic.

### 14. Venom Distillery
The south door is locked, and the lock contains a cleverly hidden poison needle trap. To pick the lock, a character with thieves' tools must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity check. Finding the trap requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check; once found, it can be disabled with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check. A character who tries to pick the lock without first disabling the trap must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the character is pricked by the needle, takes 5 (1d10) poison damage, and is blinded. The blindness is permanent but can be cured with a *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic.

>>The air in here is moist and sticky. Natural light spills from cracks in the ceiling, and mud coats the floor. Stone workbenches are laden with clay bottles of various shapes and sizes. Toadstools, snakeroot, and belladonna plants grow among the clutter, fed by water seeping from above. Standing near the plants is a hairless man with scaly skin and a bronze syringe. Lurking in the shadows around him are five slouching humans that reek of decay.
>>

Yuan-ti use this chamber to extract venom from snakes. Xopal (pronounced zoh-PAUL), a **yuan-ti pureblood**, bottles and blends the venom to create deadly new strains. Five human **zombies** serve Xopal as laborers.

Xopal carries a bronze syringe containing three doses of a poison cocktail. As an action, he can make a melee weapon attack with the syringe (+3 to hit), which deals 1 piercing damage and injects one dose of poison on a hit. Any creature injected with a dose of poison must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, the creature is poisoned for 1 hour whether or not its save succeeds.

Xopal believes it's his destiny to transform into a much more powerful form of yuan-ti—a metamorphosis that will occur when he develops a poison so virulent that even innate immunity to poison can't withstand it. Xopal uses the zombies as test subjects; once he's overcome their immunity, he plans to conduct further tests on live yuan-ti.

#### Bottled Poisons
The presence of so many poisons makes combat in this room hazardous. If a workbench is exposed to explosive force, such as that generated by a *thunderwave* or *fireball* spell, the bottles smash and create a 15-foot-radius sphere of poisonous vapors that lasts for 1 minute. Any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn within the sphere must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

Among the poisons is a stoppered bronze jug used for fermenting jungle roots into soporific gas. Removing the stopper releases the gas, which fills a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the jug. See area 3 for the effect of the soporific gas.

#### Treasure
Xopal carries a brass key that unlocks the south door.

Characters who search through the poisons can loot twenty doses of serpent venom, five doses of essence of ether, and five doses of torpor (see "*Poisons*" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

### 15. Snake Pit

>>A rickety wooden walkway threads around the walls of a deep pit. Foul odors waft up from below. Somewhere in the gloom beneath you, thousands of snakes writhe.
>>

Despite appearances, the rickety wooden walkway is safe. The yuan-ti sometimes hurl disobedient slaves into the pit to be devoured by the serpents. The pit is 50 feet deep and filled with poisonous snakes. When a creature falls or sets foot in the pit, a **swarm of poisonous snakes** forms around it and attacks. A virtually inexhaustible number of swarms can be created in this fashion. A swarm that has nothing to attack ceases to exist as its constituents slither apart.

To climb the wet cavern walls, a character must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

### 16. Blood Baths

>>The iron stench of blood floods this chamber. Along one wall, a row of gore-filled pools sink into the floor. Blood trails and bloody footprints run between the pools.
>>

When they awake each day, the yuan-ti ritually bathe in the blood of sacrifices. The blood is contained within these stone baths and heated by thermal vents underneath each pool. When the characters enter, four **yuan-ti purebloods** and two **type 2 yuan-ti malisons** bathe in the warm pools. Five slaves in loincloths (male and female Chultan human **commoners** of various alignments) tend to their every need. Give names to slaves as needed (see the "Chultan Names" sidebar in the book's introduction).

The blood-drenched yuan-ti keep their weapons at the back of each alcove. If they hear the gong alarm sound, the yuan-ti command their slaves to remain here while they arm themselves and head quickly to area 9. If combat breaks out here, reinforcements from area 17 arrive in 1d3 rounds.

### 17. Sauna

>>Heat rises from an enormous oval stone set into the floor of this chamber. Discarded skins are heaped around it, and shelves underneath it are lined with jars. A snake-headed yuan-ti sheds his skin while two strong, bare-chested human men with spears look on.
>>

The oval stone is 8 feet tall and made of porous rock. Situated atop a volcanic vent, it transfers heat evenly throughout the room. The yuan-ti come here to shed their skins and polish their scales.

Thirty jars line the shelves underneath the oval stone, and each one contains a scented ointment that yuan-ti use to keep their skin supple and to ease the shedding of their skin. The ointment is not valuable.

Unless they have been fought and defeated elsewhere, two enslaved men (NE male Chultan human **gladiators**) watch Yahru (pronounced YAH-roo), a **type 1 yuan-ti malison**, as he sheds his skin (a process that can take up to an hour). Yahru is **Ras Nsi**'s spymaster, and he doesn't like to be disturbed. Characters passing themselves off as yuan-ti purebloods are instructed to leave the room at once. Enslaved characters are ordered to smear ointment on Yahru's skin to expedite the skin-shedding process.

Yahru abhors physical combat, and he values his bodyguards too much to risk their lives in a pointless battle. Unless the characters provoke a fight, he tries to find out more about them and learn any secrets they might possess, while providing as little information as possible. If Yahru obtains information that would clearly benefit **Ras Nsi** or **Fenthaza**, he chooses which superior to bequeath it to. Yahru enjoys playing them off against each other.

If his bodyguards are defeated and he is facing death, Yahru offers small bits of information for the promise of freedom. In addition to the layout and defenses of the temple, Yahru knows the following:

- **Ras Nsi** commands the yuan-ti of Omu, but his command is tenuous. The high priest, **Fenthaza**, is **Ras Nsi**'s chief rival.
- **Ras Nsi** is slowly being eaten away by a magical disease for which there is no known cure.
- **Ras Nsi** has made a pact with a powerful lich named **Acererak**, who conquered Omu long ago and built a tomb beneath the city. The tomb's entrance is marked with an obelisk. (Yahru can provide directions.)
- **Acererak** slew the nine gods of Omu before enslaving the city's human and minotaur inhabitants, which he used to build his tomb.

### 18. Yuan-ti Nests

>>These dank catacombs have been converted into sleeping quarters. The walls are lined with alcoves that now serve as nests for yuan-ti.
>>

When the characters arrive, twelve of the eighteen alcoves are occupied by six **yuan-ti malisons** (two each of types 1, 2, and 3) and six **yuan-ti purebloods**. The remaining six alcoves are currently not in use. Passing through the area without being spotted is impossible unless the characters use magic to hide themselves.

If the gong in area 9 is struck, all the yuan-ti in this room gather their weapons and investigate.

### 19. Slave Grotto

>>A campfire casts warm light over this cavern. Heaps of dead grass and palm fronds are scattered about, and the muddy floor is pitted with footprints.
>>

When they're not working, 2d10 slaves (**commoners** of various races, alignments, and genders) dwell here. For slave names, see the "Chultan Names" sidebar in the book's introduction. Three **yuan-ti broodguards** (see *appendix D*) guard the slaves for Slavemaster Issar, a **type 3 yuan-ti malison** wearing a red cloth headdress. Issar is more interested in gazing at his own reflection in a hand mirror than putting the slaves to work.

Issar is too stately to speak to the "meat" under his command. Instead, he's chosen a Chultan slave boy named Khoti to translate his subtle, unspoken gestures. A twitch of the tail could be interpreted as an order to fetch water, or the flick of the tongue an approval. In truth, Khoti makes up most of what he sees. Issar couldn't care less either way, as long as the correct amount of deference is shown. If strangers appear before Issar, Khoti questions them on his master's behalf.

#### Slaves
Under Issar's supervision, the slaves are supposed to be widening these caverns to create new sleeping quarters for the yuan-ti. However, progress has been slow. The slaves wore down or broke most of their tools, and Issar is waiting for the delivery of new tools.

The slaves are physically healthy, but their wills have been broken by mental trauma and tranquilizing drugs. Their emotions surface only during rest, when the dreams of the Night Serpent wrench them screaming from their troubled sleep.

The slaves are not chained. Presented with an opportunity to escape, most become paralyzed with indecision. Breaking their fugue requires strong words and a successful DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check. Armed slaves who come to their senses try to slaughter as many yuan-ti as they can. They know the temple's defenses and general layout, except with regard to areas 11 and 12 (which they've never seen).

#### Treasure
Issar carries an iron key that unlocks the double door to area 13. His red cloth headdress is sewn with malachite gemstones (250 gp), and he preens in a golden hand mirror (75 gp).

### 20. Underground River

>>An underground river opens before you. Stalactites hang low over its surface, and dripping water echoes in the dark.
>>

The river links various sections of the complex. The water varies between 5 and 30 feet deep, and the current isn't strong enough to present a hazard to swimmers. To the north and south, the river descends into submerged tunnels that spread for miles under the jungle.

#### Rowboats
When the characters arrive, a pair of rowboats are pulled up on the shore near the tunnel to area 23 (see chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more information on rowboats). A cowbell dangles from a hook at the prow of each boat. Ringing either bell summons the hydra in area 21, which arrives in 1d6 rounds.

#### Yuan-ti Broodguards
Guarding the rowboats and watching the secret entrance (area 23) are four **yuan-ti broodguards** (see *appendix D*). If they detect intruders not disguised as yuan-ti, one broodguard runs to warn the yuan-ti stationed in area 19 while the others attempt to repel the interlopers.

The broodguards stop and question characters disguised as yuan-ti purebloods. To bluff their way past the guards, the characters must succeed on a group DC 10 Charisma (Deception) check. If the group check succeeds, the broodguards wave them inside without checking their story. If the group check fails, the broodguards march them to meet Slavemaster Issar in area 19.

### 21. Hydra's Lair

>>An underground river widens to form a flooded grotto. To the west, a pebble-strewn bank rises to a door recessed in the cavern wall. Near the middle of the lake, bones cling like a tide mark to a rocky pillar.
>>

A **hydra** lurks underwater in this vicinity. **Ras Nsi** treats the monster as his beloved pet and regularly feeds it slaves, prisoners, and subordinates who've defied him. The hydra's victims are bound and ferried on rowboats over the deepest part of the river. To call the monster, their captors sound the rowboat bell and hurl the hogtied victim (or victims) into the water.

While it remains fed, the hydra avoids any boats that ply back and forth. When a rowboat bell is sounded, the hydra surfaces within 1d6 rounds. If it's not fed immediately, it attacks the boat. The hydra attacks any boats that venture north of area 18. Swimmers are also fair game.

### 22. Fungi Cavern

>>The passage widens into a cavern filled with fungi. Toadstools, puffballs, and other tuberous growths cover the walls and floor. Against the far wall, a malformed skeleton lies buried under a patch of buttery mold. A brass key hangs around its neck.
>>

A patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) clings to the ceiling above the entrance and drops on the first creature that passes underneath.

A patch of yellow mold (see chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) covers the skeletal corpse. If a creature touches the mold, it ejects a cloud of deadly spores.

The corpse belongs to Kukuga, a yuan-ti pureblood who secretly worshiped Zuggtmoy (the demon queen of fungi). Kukuga concocted a fungal brew that would transform his body into a form closer to that of his demonic mistress. Instead, it led to his sudden and horrific death. Xopal (area 14) occasionally ventures into the cavern to harvest poisonous toadstools from his corpse.

To remove the brass key without disturbing the mold, a character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The key unlocks the door to the venom distillery (area 14).

### 23. Secret Entrance
If characters enter this tunnel from the surface, read:

>>The passage winds into the bowels of the earth. The air is wet and sticky, and the walls are slick with moisture. Harmless centipedes crawl across the floor as you descend.
>>

The tunnel is roughly 100 feet long. Characters who climb the tunnel toward the surface emerge amid the ruins of Omu's royal palace (see chapter 3, area 20B).

# Chapter 5: Tomb of the Nine Gods
![[064-501.webp|right|300]]

**Acererak** built the Tomb of the Nine Gods not only to house the remains of Omu's trickster gods, but also to slay interlopers. However, few today even know the tomb exists, and thus it remains an enigma. Rare are the tavern tales that lure adventurers to its gates, and its horrors remain undocumented in the libraries of Candlekeep. The reason for this is simple: not one person who has entered the tomb has lived to tell the tale.

## History of the Tomb
As the characters plumb the depths of the Tomb of the Nine Gods, they'll learn snippets of its grisly past.

### Rise of the Tomb
After **Acererak** murdered Omu's gods, he enslaved the Omuans and forced them to carve a grand tomb under one of the cliffs surrounding the city. The archlich devised brutal trials for each burial chamber, and sprinkled riddles and illusions throughout to deceive intruders. When the building work was done, he fed his slaves into the death trap to test its efficacy. The archlich turned some of his victims into undead and flesh golems, then locked them inside the tomb to serve as guardians. **Acererak** then resumed his wanderings.

In **Acererak**'s absence, the tomb snared adventurers from faraway lands and harvested their souls to feed the archlich's phylactery, which remained hidden on another plane. Every few decades, **Acererak** returned to tinker with his dungeon's traps, add treasure to its vaults, and reap a bounty of hoarded souls. His planar wanderings have influenced the tomb's mishmash of architectural styles, and have populated it with strange and deadly monsters.

### Nourishing the Atropal
On one of his journeys through the cosmos, **Acererak** stumbled upon an atropal (see *appendix D*). He brought it to Toril, ensconced it in the cradle of his tomb, and began feeding it necromantic energy, hoping to transform it into a deity: one able to claim dominion over death. Unleashed on Toril, the newborn death god would glut itself on life until none but the dead walked the world.

To nurture the atropal, **Acererak** needed an untold number of souls. The archlich made a bargain with the Sewn Sisters, a coven of night hags feared throughout the Lower Planes. Seduced by the prospect of a near-endless supply of souls, the hags joined **Acererak** in his tomb. With their assistance, the archlich crafted the Soulmonger—a necromantic device that could reap the souls of the dying from across Toril and feed them to the atropal. Leaving the Sewn Sisters behind as nursemaids, **Acererak** abandoned his tomb to watch the rise of the death god from afar.

## Exploring the Tomb
To survive the tomb's horrors, the player characters must call on every ounce of their cunning and willpower.

### General Features
The following features are common throughout the tomb. Some levels of the tomb have additional features that are described at the beginning of their respective sections.

#### Ceilings
Unless specified otherwise, ceilings in the tomb are 8 feet high in corridors and 12 feet high in rooms.

#### Crawlways
Certain areas of the tomb are accessible only by way of narrow tunnels. These crawlways are 3 feet high and 2 feet wide.

#### Lighting
All areas of the tomb are unlit unless noted otherwise.

#### Secret Doors
Most secret doors within the tomb slide open on stone runners. The handles that unlock them are hidden within the features of relief carvings along the walls, including inside the jaws of many graven skulls.

A secret door can be spotted by any character within 5 feet of it who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 20 or higher, or with a search and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### Staircases
Stairs in the tomb are carved out of the living rock, and each step is topped with a single slab of cut stone. The skulls and bones of dead Omuans fill niches along the walls of each staircase. Staircases run 25 feet between each level of the tomb.

#### Tracks
Explorers have broken into the tomb recently, and **Withers** and his tomb dwarves make frequent patrols. Their trails crisscross back and forth, making other creatures in the tomb difficult to track. The freshest tracks belong to the **skeleton keys** (see "Tomb Inhabitants" below). Any character who tries to follow a **skeleton key**'s trail can do so with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check, finding the way to the nearest unexplored location marked with a skull symbol on the dungeon map.

### Tomb Inhabitants
A grim pageant of monstrous residents lurks in the tomb, waiting to greet visitors.

#### Withers and the Tomb Dwarves
**Withers**, **Acererak**'s undead custodian, oversees the undead maintenance crew that keeps the tomb's traps in working order. To assemble that team, **Acererak** abducted dwarf miners and transformed them into wights to exploit their expertise at underground construction. **Withers** acts as supervisor for the dwarves and serves as **Acererak**'s adjunct when the archlich visits the tomb. Using his scrying pool at area 25, **Withers** can command Omu's gargoyles and speak to agents on the surface world.

**Withers** and his crew use the staircase at area 26 to roam unseen through the tomb's many levels. When their work is done, they retreat to their secret headquarters on level 2 of the tomb (areas 27 and 28). **Withers** avoids contact with the characters when possible, confident that **Acererak**'s traps will defeat them.

#### Legendary Monsters
Two legendary monsters dwell in **Acererak**'s tomb: a beholder guarding a treasure vault (area 44) and an aboleth lurking in an underground lake (area 65). These creatures can't use lair actions within the tomb, and the regional effects of each creature's lair are localized to the levels where they dwell.

Despite being the dungeon's creator, **Acererak** doesn't count the Tomb of the Nine Gods as his lair. Consequently, no lair actions or regional effects are ascribed to the archlich in this adventure.

#### Skeleton Keys
To unlock the final gate to the Soulmonger, the adventurers must acquire five skeleton keys—each the carved skull of an animated human skeleton that roams the tomb. The characters can capture and control these skeletons, or can simply snap a skull off its spine.

A **skeleton key** has the statistics of a **skeleton**, with these changes:

- The **skeleton key** is unaligned.
- It has a climbing speed of 30 feet and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- It wields a pair of daggers and can make two melee weapon attacks (+4 to hit) as an action. Each dagger attack deals 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage on a hit.
- When reduced to 0 hit points, a **skeleton key** falls apart, though its skull and bones remain intact.
- A **skeleton key** does not trigger any trap placed in a room or on a door of the tomb.

Each **skeleton key** has a skull that extends into a carved key-like shape. These shapes match the keyholes of the skeleton gate in the lair of the Sewn Sisters (area 71). The Skeleton Keys table summarizes the location and shape of each key.

***Finding a Skeleton Key.*** Each of the first five levels of the tomb has its own **skeleton key**. A **skeleton key** can be encountered in any of the locations marked with a skull symbol on the level map. You choose a **skeleton key**'s location. You can also change your mind and relocate the **skeleton key** to make it easier or harder to find.

Apart from unlocking the skeleton gate in area 71, the skeleton keys perform no function. When the characters enter an area containing a **skeleton key**, it might be standing in the middle of the room, standing in a corner, walking across the ceiling, or clinging to a wall. A **skeleton key**'s primary goal is to avoid capture or destruction, so it flees if it can.

![[065-502.webp|right|300]]

#### Skeleton Keys

| Tomb Level | Key Shape |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Triangle |
| 2 | Square |
| 3 | Pentagon |
| 4 | Hexagon |
| 5 | Octagon |

#### The Sewn Sisters
In the lowest level of the tomb, a coven of night hags nurses the atropal to its apotheosis. See area 71 and "The Sewn Sisters" sidebar near that section for more information on the hags.

#### Tomb Guardians
Adventurers who have perished inside the tomb are stitched together by tomb dwarves and bolted into suits of armor. Once complete, these shambling golems are released into the tomb to hunt intruders.

A **tomb guardian** is a **flesh golem** clad in plate armor, giving it AC 17. One or two tomb guardians should appear whenever you feel the need for combat. As the characters delve deeper into the tomb, they should come to know these monsters well.

#### Trickster God Spirits
The spirits of the nine trickster gods of Omu haunt the tomb. Although they cannot escape it, these spirits can inhabit adventurers within the tomb (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods").

### Fabled Treasures
Among the many treasures hidden in the tomb are four fabled art objects that hold special value. **Acererak** uses them to lure adventurers to the tomb.

Any character with proficiency in the History skill who lays eyes on one of these treasures can recall its lore with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (History) check.

#### Black Opal Crown
The Black Opal Crown was once worn by the archmage Sadamor of Netheril. Legend speaks of how Sadamor saw the depths of humanity's evil reflected in the opal of his crown. Heartbroken, he created a doomsday device—a *sphere of annihilation*—to swallow the world but was consumed by his own creation.

The yuan-ti nightmare speaker **Fenthaza** (see chapter 4) believes that the Black Opal Crown can awaken Dendar the Night Serpent. If the characters find the crown, **Fenthaza** tries to kill them before they escape Chult with it. The crown rests in the maze of death (area 49).

#### Eye of Zaltec
For centuries, this fist-sized ruby surmounted the Great Pyramid in Nexal, capital city of the Maztican Empire. The gem is a relic of the cult of Zaltec, and its dagger-like point was plunged into the hearts of countless sacrifices.

An adventuring band known as the Company of the Yellow Banner entered Omu to find the Eye of Zaltec and was never seen again. The Eye of Zaltec is guarded by a stone juggernaut (area 62).

#### Navel of the Moon
Said to be carved from a chunk of the moon, this polished egg-shaped stone was given as a gift by the ruling syl-pasha of Calimport to his sailor daughter. It is said that anyone who holds the stone can always find the way home to his or her loved ones.

The tabaxi hunter **Bag of Nails** (see chapter 3) came to Omu in search of the Navel of the Moon but failed to find it. The Navel of the Moon is set into the pendulum of a grandfather clock inside a secret room (area 56).

#### Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare
This jeweled goblet was crafted from the skull of a long-dead Omuan king and served as a symbol of office for the royal line of Omu. The legendary Chultan hero Ch'gakare (pronounced chuh-GAH-kah-ree) is said to have beheaded the king after escaping the Nine Hells on the back of a mastodon.

Princess Mwaxanaré (see "Kir Sabal," and *appendix D*) is keen to recover the Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare as part of her bid to reclaim the throne of Omu. To obtain it, characters must first survive the perils of the hall of the golden mastodon (area 67).

### Spell Restrictions
Many spells have altered effects when cast in the Tomb of the Nine Gods, including spells cast from magic items or artifacts, and class abilities that duplicate the effects of spells. **Acererak**'s magic and the magic of the *amulet of the black skull* (see *appendix C*) are unaffected.

Spells that would normally allow creatures to transport into and out of the tomb either fail or deposit their recipients in area 57. Spells that normally allow one to pass through stone fail, and divination spells cast within the tomb provide false readings. Spells designed to communicate over long distances are similarly foiled. These alterations are summarized in the Modified Spells table. Spells not included in the table might suffer similar alterations, at your discretion.

Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally, as does magic that involves the creation of an extradimensional space. Any spells cast within an extradimensional space (such as that created by *rope trick*) are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast in the tomb.

##### Modified Spells
| Spells | Effect |
|---|---|
| *Antimagic field* | This spell does not prevent the spirits of trickster gods from inhabiting hosts. The spell also has no effect on the Soulmonger. |
| *Arcane gate* | Any creature that tries to enter or leave the tomb using this spell appears in area 57. |
| *Astral projection* | This spell fails if cast in the tomb or if its intended destination is inside the tomb. |
| *Augury* | This spell returns false readings if cast in the tomb. |
| *Banishing smite* | Any creature banished by this spell appears in area 57. |
| *Banishment* | Same as *banishing smite*. |
| *Clairvoyance* | This spell fails if the sensor is meant to appear inside the tomb. |
| *Commune* | This spell returns no answer if cast in the tomb. |
| *Dimension door* | Same as *arcane gate*. |
| *Divination* | Same as *augury*. |
| *Etherealness* | The caster enters the Border Ethereal but can't move through surfaces or doors in the tomb. Ethereal characters might encounter one or more of the Sewn Sisters. |
| *Find traps* | This spell fails if cast in the tomb. |
| *Gate* | Any creature in the tomb that steps through the gate created by this spell appears in area 57. |
| *Passwall* | This spell does not allow passage through surfaces or doors in the tomb. |
| *Plane shift* | Same as *arcane gate*. |
| *Stone shape* | This spell has no effect on surfaces, doors, sarcophagi, stone blocks, or statues in the tomb. |
| *Teleport* | Same as *arcane gate*. |
| *Teleportation circle* | Same as *arcane gate*. |
| *Transport via plants* | Same as *astral projection*. |
| *Tree stride* | Same as *astral projection*. |
| *Wish* | This spell can't be used to escape the tomb. |
| *Word of recall* | Same as *arcane gate*. |

### Replacing Dead Characters
If a character dies in the Tomb of the Nine Gods and you need a hook to introduce a new party member, choose from the suggestions below or work with the character's player to devise something appropriate:

- The replacement character broke into the tomb centuries ago but was imprisoned inside a magical carving. When one of the other characters accidentally leans against this carving, the replacement character is released from captivity.
- The replacement character hails from another world (Athas, Krynn, Oerth, medieval Earth, or any other milieu of your choosing) and is trapped in stasis within the tomb as one of **Acererak**'s trophies. If the character is touched, the archlich's binding magic ends.
- The replacement character is a clone of the fallen adventurer. The hags in area 71 created and tortured the clone to gain information about the adventurers' presence in the tomb. Having escaped, the new character suffers from amnesia and has scant memory of the hags. The clone has gear scavenged from dead adventurers.
- The new character is the sole survivor of a doomed adventuring company that breached the tomb in order to find and destroy the Soulmonger.

## Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods
**Acererak** trapped the spirits of Omu's nine trickster gods in the tomb he constructed in their name, and they're not happy about it. The spirits don't know the tomb's layout or defenses, but they offer advice and magical powers to those they inhabit. Of course, their assistance comes at a price.

##### Trickster Gods
| Spirit | Align. | Personality | Inherited Flaw | Enemy | Power |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| I'jin (female) | CN | Fickle and unpredictable | "I never stick to a plan." | Obo'laka | The host's Dexterity score becomes 23, unless it is already higher. |
| Kubazan (male) | CG | Wild and spirited | "I am fearless and not afraid to take great risks." | Papazotl | The host's Strength score becomes 23, unless it is already higher. |
| Moa (male) | LG | Truthful and kind | "I must always speak the truth." | Wongo | The host can use an action to turn invisible. Anything the host is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the host's person. The effect ends if the host attacks, casts a spell, forces a saving throw, or deals damage. |
| Nangnang (female) | NE | Selfish and cruel | "I won't share with others." | Shagambi | The host can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. It gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. |
| Obo'laka (female) | LN | Nervous and obsessive | "I am risk-averse and a slave to routine." | I'jin | The host can attune to one additional magic item. When Obo'laka leaves the host, all magic items to which the host is attuned are no longer attuned to it. |

| Wongo (male) | CE | Violent and deranged | "I act without concern for the well-being of others." | Moa | The host can use an action to unleash a psionic assault on a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the target's next turn. |

### Spiritual Inhabitation
The spirits are bound inside magic items scattered throughout the tomb. When a creature of the humanoid type touches such an item, the trickster god bound within attempts to inhabit that creature. With a successful DC 16 Charisma saving throw, the creature resists the god's power, and that god can't attempt to inhabit the same creature for the remainder of the adventure. On a failed save—or if the creature chooses to forgo the save—the god's spirit inhabits the creature's body. The trickster gods can tell whether or not a creature is humanoid, and they have no interest in possessing other types of creatures.

While inhabiting a host body, a trickster god acts like an overbearing passenger. The host creature remains in control of its actions but inherits a flaw from the god, as well as a special power. When a trickster god inhabits a player character, give the player that god's card (see *appendix F*). A character doesn't know what power and flaw are gained from a specific trickster god until that god inhabits the character for the first time. Both the flaw and the power end when the spirit leaves the host.

### Leaving a Host
A trickster god never willingly leaves a host, but its spirit is forced out if a host dies or leaves the tomb, or if a host is targeted by the break enchantment function of the *dispel evil and good* spell. A trickster god can also be forced out by another trickster god (see "Fighting Over a Host" below).

When the spirit of a trickster god is forced out of a host, it returns to the magic item to which it is bound and cannot inhabit that host again for the remainder of the adventure. If the item is destroyed or taken from the tomb, the trickster god's spirit finds another object within the tomb to inhabit. The spirits of the trickster gods can't be destroyed and can never leave the tomb.

### Fighting Over a Host
When the spirit of one trickster god inhabits a host that is already inhabited by a trickster god, the two gods battle for the right to remain in the host. Assign "even" to one god and "odd" to another, then roll any die. The result determines which god is victorious, with the losing god forced out of the host. The host has no influence over which god gets forced out.

### Roleplaying the Spirits
A trickster god can use the host character's senses and speak to the host's mind. The character retains his or her alignment and can think independently. However, if the character has a flaw that runs counter to the trickster god's flaw, the character's flaw is suppressed until the trickster god's spirit leaves the character's body.

You can roleplay the voices of the trickster gods in the characters' heads, but let the players roleplay their characters' inherited flaws. If a player neglects to roleplay a trickster god's flaw, have the inhabiting spirit attempt to goad the character into behaving more like it. You can award inspiration to a player who roleplays a trickster god's flaw particularly well.

All the trickster gods are eager to get their revenge on **Acererak**. They can offer only limited guidance regarding the tomb and its denizens, but they encourage the characters to seek out other trickster god spirits and offer supernatural assistance in the final battle against the archlich.

Each trickster god (except Unkh) has its own rival in the tomb that it would prefer to avoid. The Omuans dreamed up colorful stories to explain these antipathies, but in truth, the spirits simply represent conflicting points on the alignment axes. When rival spirits occupy different characters in the same group, they try to make their hosts bicker and defy each other whenever possible.

## Level 1: Rotten Halls
Map 5.1 shows this level of the dungeon. The air is stale and humid here. Moss covers the walls, which are decorated with screaming skulls and hung with rotting tree roots and dead vines.

![[067-505a.webp|right|300]]
#### Ceiling Cracks
Thin shafts of daylight and moonlight spill through tiny rock fissures, forming pools of natural light as shown on map 5.1. A Tiny creature can use these narrow fissures to enter and leave the tomb.

#### Underground River
Muddy rainwater seeps from the jungles above, flowing through the tomb as a sluggish underground river that is treated as difficult terrain. The water is 3 feet deep, with the tunnel ceiling above it varying from 6 inches to 3 feet over the surface. The water is unfit for drinking.

### 1. Acererak's Warning

>>Near the base of the cliffs, a fifteen-foot-tall obelisk of cracked stone is draped with vines and black moss. Behind it, you see a dark passageway obscured by withered creepers. A second, smaller tunnel burrows into the base of a cliff to the east.
>>

The tunnel leading to the tomb's true entrance (area 4) is obscured by vegetation and cannot be detected unless the characters search for it. However, any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check around the areas of the false entrance (area 2) or the open gallery (area 3) notices something more:

>>Three stone gargoyles watch you from narrow ledges carved into the cliff side. Each has the face of a bearded devil, its mouth agape in a silent scream.
>>

The three **gargoyles** are perched on the ledges overlooking the obelisk, at the points marked G on map 5.1. The ledges are 30 feet above the ground, 5 feet wide, 2 feet deep, and spaced 25 feet apart. The gargoyles swoop down and attack anyone who tries to topple or damage the obelisk, or who attacks them first.

#### Obelisk
The obelisk radiates a strong aura of abjuration magic under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell or similar magic, and a paladin using Divine Sense can detect a fiendish presence within the obelisk. Clearing the vines and moss from the south face of the obelisk exposes a message carved into it in Common. (Give the players a copy of handout 17 in appendix E.) The message reads as follows:

>>Fear the night when the forsaken one seizes death's mantle and the seas dry up and the dead rise and I, **Acererak** the Eternal, reap the world of the living. Those who dare enter take heed: The enemies oppose.
>>
>>One stands between them.
>>
>>In darkness, it hides.
>>
>>Don the mask or be seen.
>>
>>Speak no truth to the doomed child.
>>
>>The keys turn on the inside only.
>>

The warnings **Acererak** has placed on the obelisk and on the grand staircase (area 7) provide clues to overcoming some of the challenges of the tomb. The obelisk's clues pertain to features and locations on level 1, specifically the true entrance (area 4), the devil face (area 5B), Obo'laka's tomb (area 10), Moa's tomb (area 14), and Wongo's tomb (area 16).

Characters with a combined Strength of 60 or more can topple the obelisk, breaking it off at the base. Breaking or destroying the obelisk releases a cloud of black smoke that coalesces into a **nalfeshnee** demon. The demon appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the obelisk and attacks those responsible for the obelisk's desecration. After 1 minute, the demon disappears and returns to the Abyss.

The teleportation function of the ebon pool (area 81) returns characters to the obelisk even if it is toppled or destroyed.

### 2. Gallery of Tricksters

>>Alcoves run the length of a narrow tunnel, each one featuring a bestial statue standing or squatting above a basin of oil.
>>

The statues depict the nine trickster gods, with each facing pair of alcoves dedicated to two trickster gods who oppose each other. Moving down the hall from west to east, the opposing statues depict Moa (jaculi) and Wongo (su-monster), I'jin (almiraj) and Obo'laka (zorbo), Papazotl (eblis) and Kubazan (froghemoth), and Nangnang (grung) and Shagambi (kamadan).

Each statue is 3 feet tall and can't be moved from its pedestal. When any character carrying a puzzle cube (see chapter 3) enters the tunnel, the oil basin matching the cube's trickster god bursts into flame. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of divination magic around the statues. The oil basins give off an aura of conjuration.

Only eight trickster gods are initially visible; the statue of Unkh (flail snail) is hidden behind a secret door at the end of the tunnel, though it functions the same as the others. Bringing Unkh's puzzle cube into the tunnel lights Unkh's brazier, giving characters advantage on ability checks made to find the secret door.

#### Treasure
A golden pendant shaped like an eye hangs on the Unkh statue. It is worth 25 gp and radiates an aura of divination magic. If a character wearing the pendant passes within 10 feet of the obelisk at area 1, the pendant tugs the character toward the hidden tomb entrance (area 4). The pendant is also of use in area 79.

### 3. False Entrance
After 20 feet, a puzzle door sealing off a small chamber beyond blocks this false entrance into the tomb.

>>A short tunnel ends at a slab of worked stone, whose edges are marked by relief carvings of grinning skulls. Four lines engraved at the center of the slab cross one another to form a star, with both ends of each line marking the location of a cube-shaped cavity cut into the door—eight cavities in all.
>>

Each cavity is sized to hold one of the puzzle cubes recovered from the shrines of Omu (see chapter 3). However, there are nine puzzle cubes in total and only eight cavities.

If puzzle cubes representing every trickster god except Unkh are inserted into the cavities in such a way that the cubes of rival gods are opposite to one another, a stone block slowly descends over the tunnel entrance. Any character in the tunnel must decide whether to stay or to flee, which requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Characters who stay or who fail the check are trapped when the stone block seals off the tunnel. Once the tunnel is sealed, caustic gas billows out from the mouths of the relief-carved skulls. Any creature trapped in the tunnel must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) poison damage and 5 (1d10) acid damage. While any affected creature remains in the tunnel, it must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. After 10 rounds, the gas valves close and the stone block rises back into the ceiling. Any puzzle cubes still in their cavities are pushed out, and the trap resets.

Any character searching the tunnel for traps spots the raised stone block with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. The weight of the block makes it impossible to hinder its descent. Any character who examines the puzzle door and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check notices holes in the mouths of the skulls. Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the gas from being released. Doing so while the trap is active is difficult, requiring six successful DC 10 Dexterity checks, each made as an action.

Beyond the false door is a gas-filled chamber. Any creature that starts its turn in this area takes 11 (2d10) poison damage and 11 (2d10) acid damage.

### 4. True Entrance
Thick foliage conceals the true entrance to the Tomb of the Nine Gods. Any character searching the base of the cliff at this location finds the entrance with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

>>Pulling aside the heavy undergrowth, you uncover an archway in the cliff face. Stone skulls peer down from the lintel, and old bones litter the threshold. As light strikes the entrance, a swarm of bats screeches out from within.
>>

The bats are harmless. Jungle predators use this tunnel as shelter, and the bones are a mix of grung and velociraptors. Any character who searches for tracks discovers boot prints leading into the tomb. The tracks are not recent and belong to the last group of treasure seekers to enter here.

#### 4A. First Puzzle Door

>>A slab of worked stone blocks the overgrown tunnel some twenty feet from the entrance. Grinning skulls mark the edges of the slab, in the center of which are nine cube-shaped cavities arranged in three rows of three.
>>

Give the players copies of the god symbols in handout 11 of appendix E. The individual squares can be cut out to be arranged by the players as they wish, or they can simply make notes on paper.

To open the door, the characters must fill the cavities with all nine puzzle cubes retrieved from the shrines of Omu (see chapter 3), but in the proper configuration. The cubes representing the trickster gods must be placed so that each god is opposite its rival's cube on the grid, with Unkh (who is neutral and has no rivals) in the middle. For example, a puzzle cube inserted into a corner of the grid must have its rival in the diagonally opposite corner. Diagram 5.1 shows one possible configuration, though others will work as long as Unkh is situated between I'jin (CN) and Obo'laka (LN), between Kubazan (CG) and Papazotl (LE), between Moa (LG) and Wongo (CE), and between Nangnang (NE) and Shagambi (NG).

If a puzzle cube is placed incorrectly, any previously placed cubes pop out. Electricity then erupts from the incorrectly placed cube, dealing 18 (4d8) lightning damage to any creature within 20 feet of the door. A *mage hand* spell can be used to place the cubes from farther away and avoid this damage.

A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of evocation magic around each of the cavities. If the characters place the cubes correctly, read:

>>The nine cubes flare with light, then disappear. Growling like an angry beast, the slab begins to slide up into the ceiling.
>>

When the door opens, the puzzle cubes teleport back to their respective shrines in Omu. Once the door has fully risen, it remains open for 1 hour before slowly sinking back into place. Characters who are outside when the door closes must revisit the city to recover the cubes.

![[068-503.webp|right|300]]

#### 4B. Second Puzzle Door
When the characters move past the first door, read:

>>Another slab blocks the hallway twenty feet beyond the first door. An iron lever is set into the door's surface, with a graven stone skull leering down from above.
>>

When a character reaches the midpoint of the hall, read:

>>The skull's jaws creak open, and a skeletal hand holding a crystal hourglass-style timer emerges from within. With a click, the timer rotates and sand starts to trickle into its lower globe.
>>

Count down slowly from 10, and let the players tell you what, if anything, their characters do in that time. If the characters don't pull the lever by the time you've finished your countdown, the lever and the sand timer retract as the door sinks into the floor, revealing area 5 beyond. The sand timer can't be budged or damaged.

After remaining open for 1 hour, the door slowly rises to seal off the passage once more. Characters can prevent the door from rising by jamming iron spikes into the surrounding floor seams. The lever resets when the door returns to its closed position. The door can't be opened from the north side.

***Pit Trap.*** Pulling the lever causes the floor between the two doors to split open along a central seam. Each creature standing on the floor when the lever is pulled tumbles into a 20-foot-deep pit lined with poisoned spikes. With a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, the character who pulled the lever can avoid falling by hanging onto it. The pit remains open until the lever is reset to its original position.

Each creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and is impaled on 1d4 spikes, each of which deals 3 (1d6) piercing damage and 5 (1d10) poison damage. Any creature that takes poison damage from one or more spikes is poisoned for 24 hours, or until the condition is removed with a *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic.

Spotting the seam along the floor requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Characters can hammer spikes into the floor to prevent it from dropping, but at least ten spikes are needed because of the floor's size and weight.

### 5. Trapped Corridor

>>A moss-covered corridor extends beyond the second door. Tree roots hang from the sagging ceiling, and the air reeks of rot and damp. Ahead, a bas-relief carving of a bearded devil's face adorns the wall at a T-shaped intersection. The devil's open mouth is a well of utter darkness.
>>

#### 5A. Poison Darts
Each X on the map marks a 5-foot-square pressure plate triggered by 20 pounds or more. When a plate is triggered, four poisoned darts shoot out from spring-loaded tubes in the walls. Each dart makes a ranged attack (+8 to hit) against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate. Any creature hit by a dart takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Moss obscures the tiny holes in the walls through which the darts are fired, but they can be spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. With a careful inspection of the floor and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notes irregularities in the floor's tile patterns that reveal the pressure plates. Wedging an iron spike or similar object under a plate prevents that plate from being triggered. Stuffing the wall holes adjacent to a pressure plate with cloth or wax prevents the darts from being fired.

#### 5B. Devil Face
Magical darkness and a permanent *silence* spell fills the mouth of the devil face and a large cavity behind it. The face is sculpted from stone and melds seamlessly with the surrounding wall, and its mouth is wide enough for a Medium or smaller creature to crawl through. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of illusion magic over the face.

The cavity behind the devil's mouth is home to a **shadow demon** that can see normally in the magical darkness. If any creature reaches into the mouth, the demon makes an attack against it with advantage, then continues attacking if any creature enters its abode.

A successful *dispel magic* (DC 16) cast on the demon's lair dispels the magical darkness and the silence. If the darkness is dispelled, the shadow demon emerges and attacks until reduced to half its hit points or fewer, at which point it flees to a darker area of the tomb.

#### 5C. Floor Hatch

>>A rusted iron grate is set into the corridor floor. Through its bars, you see muddy water flowing slowly past.
>>

The bars cannot be bent or broken, but they are spaced widely enough that a Small creature can squeeze through them. The grate can also be lifted by one or more creatures with a combined Strength score of 24 or more. Any creature that passes through the hatch drops into the sluggish underground river, which flows toward area 17.

### 6. Crystal Window

>>Creepers and vines cling to the walls of this corridor, at the end of which is an arched crystal window, six feet wide and ten feet high. Through it, you can see a dark chamber.
>>

The crystal window peers into Obo'laka's tomb (area 10), cannot be opened, and blocks all sound between area 6 and area 10. The window has AC 5, a damage threshold of 15, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

When any character approaches the crystal window and peers through it, read the boxed text in area 10, omitting the last sentence about the window.

If the characters enter area 10 through the broken window without taking appropriate steps to conceal themselves, the undead creatures in Obo'laka's tomb attack (see area 10 for more information).

### 7. Grand Staircase

>>A grand chamber opens ahead, fifty feet across and plunging down into darkness below. A stone balcony winds around the walls to connect four archways. Other balcony levels are visible below, with corridors radiating off in all directions. To the north, a stone staircase descends to the lowerlevels.
>>

The grand staircase connects the first four levels of the tomb, each of which is 25 feet below the level above. The balcony is 5 feet wide.

#### 7A. We Are Not Alone
The first character to reach this point on the map glimpses a tomb dwarf on the level below:

>>A hunched figure glares up at you from the balcony below, wearing a mask that is a replica of the devil face at the tomb entrance. Without saying a word, the figure steps out of sight.
>>

If the characters take action at once, they can catch the tomb dwarf. The tomb dwarf uses the statistics of a **wight**, except that it wields a battleaxe and a light crossbow. If it is not caught, the creature moves silently through the secret door to area 25. To any character leaning over the balcony to see where the figure went, it appears to have vanished into thin air.

#### 7B. Acererak's Second Warning
A bronze plaque is fixed to the east wall of the balcony on level 2, engraved with another of **Acererak**'s cryptic warnings in Common. (Give the players a copy of handout 18 in appendix E.) It reads as follows:

>>The ring is a path to another tomb.
>>
>>The dead abhor sunlight.
>>
>>Only a jewel can tame the frog.
>>
>>Bow as the dead god intoned.
>>
>>Into darkness descend.
>>

The clues on this plaque pertain to locations on level 2, specifically the gravity ring (area 19), the false tomb (area 20), Nangnang's tomb (area 24), Papazotl's tomb (area 22), and the devil pit (area 18).

#### 7C. Acererak's Third Warning
Another bronze plaque appears on the north wall of the balcony on level 3. (Give the players a copy of handout 19 in appendix E.) This warning reads as follows:

>>Walk through water with weapon in hand.
>>
>>Slake your shadow at the font.
>>
>>The vulture is the first step.
>>
>>Right the gods.
>>
>>The walls of history tell all.
>>

The clues on this bronze plaque pertain to features and locations on level 3, specifically the reflected hall (area 31), the magic font (area 33), I'jin's tomb (area 35), the golem pit (area 39), and Kubazan's tomb (area 42).

#### 7D. Acererak's Fourth Warning
The last warning is on a bronze plaque mounted to the west wall of the balcony on level 4. (Give the players a copy of handout 20 in appendix E.) It reads as follows:

>>Death to fire, dine or drown, precious air, and falling sand.
>>
>>The army sleeps in silence.
>>
>>The mirror holds twelve.
>>
>>Find the iron scepter's twin.
>>
>>The maze holds the key.
>>

The clues on this bronze plaque pertain to features and locations on level 4, specifically the elemental traps (area 47), Shagambi's tomb (area 48), the *mirror of life trapping* (area 50), the scepter in the crypt of the Sun Queen (area 53), and Unkh's tomb (area 55).

### 8. Magical Attraction

>>A rusting statue of a knight stands at the west end of this hall, gripping a large iron shield. Shards and flakes of rusted metal cover the floor around the statue's feet.
>>

A magical field around the statue attracts metal objects of any kind (not just ferrous metal). Any metal object that comes into direct contact with the shield disintegrates, showering the floor with powdered rust. Artifacts are immune to this corrosion. Any metal object not being worn or carried that enters the room is instantly drawn to the shield if it weighs 150 pounds or less. Any creature wearing or carrying metal items that enters the room or starts its turn there can feel the pull of the statue and must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to resist it. On a failed check, the creature loses its footing, flies across the chamber, and slams into the statue, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved. If the character is wearing metal armor, the check is made with disadvantage. The shield disintegrates only metal objects that come into direct contact with it, so a metal object stored in a backpack would be protected from destruction by the pack's leather.

A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation magic over the shield. The statue and shield are treated as a single Large object with AC 17; 40 hit points; immunity to piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the statue and shield are destroyed, the trap is disabled. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 17) cast on the statue shuts down the attractive field for 1 hour.

### 9. Magic Fountain

>>A large fountain crusted with moss rises in the middle of a circular room. Three marble maidens stand in the fountain, holding pitchers out of which water flows.
>>

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Obo'laka or Wongo receive advice when entering this area:

- Cautious Obo'laka advises against anyone drinking from the fountain.
- Reckless Wongo encourages his host to drink from the fountain.

#### Magic Fountain
Any creature that drinks from the fountain experiences a random magical effect, determined by rolling a d4 and consulting the Magic Fountain Effects table. Water removed from the fountain and stored in a container retains its magical properties, and a different effect occurs each time someone drinks from the container. Under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell or similar effect, the fountain radiates an aura of transmutation magic.

#### Magic Fountain Effects

| d4 | Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The creature drinking the water must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies and turns to dust. |
| 2 | The creature drinking the water loses the ability to speak for 8 hours. A *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic ends this effect. |
| 3 | The creature drinking the water magically changes sex. A *greater restoration* spell restores the creature's original sex, as does another drink from the fountain that yields this same result. |
| 4 | The creature drinking the water gains 2d10 temporary hit points. |

### 10. Obo'laka's Tomb

>>This vaulted tomb is overgrown with moss and creepers. A stone sarcophagus rests on a stepped dais in the middle of the floor. On the wall behind the sarcophagus, two large statues of bears grip a five-foot-diameter bronze disk embossed with a dozen glaring eyes. Six desiccated corpses slump on thrones in niches along the walls. Each corpse wears a black mask made of papier-mâché and feathers. An arched crystal window to the east offers a view of the tunnel beyond.
>>

See area 6 for a description of the crystal window.

The corpses slumped on the thrones are six dormant **wights**. If the eyes on the bronze disk spot intruders in the tomb (see "Disk of Eyes"), the wights rise and attack. The wights also attack if one or more of them takes any damage. They won't leave the chamber to pursue intruders. Once all intruders are dead or gone, the wights return to their thrones and fall dormant once more.

#### Disk of Eyes
Any character who studies the disk notices that its eyes are moving, their bronzed pupils flicking back and forth to scan the tomb for intruders. These eyes have darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If the eyes spot any humanoids inside the tomb, the wights awaken and attack. The disk of eyes can't perceive any humanoid that dons one of the papier-mâché masks worn by the wights, nor can it see in magical darkness or while covered with a blanket or similar object.

The bronze disk weighs 250 pounds. The bear statues grip the disk tightly in their stone paws, so that it can't be pried free without smashing the statues. Each statue is a Large object with AC 17; 45 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of divination magic around the disk.

#### Sarcophagus
Any creature wearing one of the wights' papier-mâché masks can push aside the lid of the sarcophagus with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. To all other creatures, the lid is magically locked and cannot be opened without a *knock* spell or a successful DC 20 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools.

#### Secret Doors
Secret doors are set into the back walls of two alcoves—one to the north and the other to the south. The secret door to the south has edges made of flint. Opening this door creates sparks that ignite the gas in area 11 (see that area for details).

#### Treasure
The bones of a zorbo (Obo'laka's animal form; see *appendix D*) lie in a dusty pile within the sarcophagus. A *ring of protection* rests atop the pile. The ring turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see "Lost Treasures").

***Obo'laka's Spirit.*** The spirit of Obo'laka tries to inhabit any character who touches the ring (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods"). When Obo'laka's spirit manifests, read:

>>As you touch the ring, the dust swirls into the shape of a small, feral, bear-like creature that billows toward you with a ghostly roar.
>>

If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Obo'laka's card (see *appendix F*). If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the ring and waits for another character to touch it.

### 11. Gas Pocket
This section of the underground river contains a buildup of flammable gas that has a rotten odor. If a torch, lantern, or other open flame is brought into the area, or if the secret door to area 10 is opened, the gas explodes. Each creature in the area of the gas pocket or within 15 feet of it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. The explosion burns away the gas, which builds up again after 8 hours.

### 12. Trapped Chest

>>Water pours from cracks and seams in the rough walls of this cavern, whose floor is a muddy pool that flushes out into the tunnel beyond. Just above the pool's surface, a large treasure chest dangles from rusty chains embedded in the ceiling.
>>

The chest is 6 feet long, 3 feet wide, 3 feet high, and suspended 1 foot above the surface of the 5-foot-deep pool. A keyhole shaped like a cackling demon skull decorates the front of the lid. Encircling the keyhole, a tiny inscription in Common reads, "I devour all but the greatest thieves."

The chest is locked and doesn't appear to be trapped. However, a *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of evocation magic around it. Picking the lock requires a successful DC 22 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools. This also disarms the lock's magical trap, allowing the chest to be opened safely.

If the check fails, the demon skull bites down on the thieves' tools and destroys them. If the check fails by 5 or more, the magical trap teleports the character making the check inside the locked chest, whereupon the character is restrained. The chains holding the chest then release it into the water, where it sinks to the bottom of the pool. Even if the chest is removed from the water, a character trapped within runs out of air after 5 rounds (see "*Suffocating*" in chapter 8 of the *Player's Handbook*).

The chest is a Medium object with AC 13, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Any character who attempts to pick the lock or hit the chest with a melee or ranged attack while it's underwater does so with disadvantage.

#### Treasure
The chest interior is lined with lead and contains 300 gp, a gold tankard embossed with a sad face that smiles when the tankard is filled (250 gp), and a stoppered bone tube containing a *spell scroll* of *remove curse*.

### 13. Stone Skull

>>A giant stone skull crusted with moss juts out from the end of the passageway. A flame flickers within each of its eye sockets, and a view into a chamber beyond can be seen through its open jaws.
>>

Any character who peers through the skull can see into area 14 (see the description below). The skull's jaws are opened wide enough to allow a Medium or smaller creature to climb though.

Each time a creature climbs through the skull's jaws, one of the flames in its eye sockets snuffs out. The third time a creature climbs through, the jaws clamp shut, making a melee weapon attack with a +10 bonus. On a hit, the target creature takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and is grappled (escape DC 19). While it remains grappled, the creature takes 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. When that creature exits the jaws, the flames in the skull's eye sockets reignite, the jaws open, and the trap resets.

The flames within the eye sockets give off no heat or smoke, and they can't be extinguished except in the manner described above. Any character searching the skull and succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notes that the lower jaw is hinged. A stout object jammed into the skull's jaw holds it open for as long as the object can withstand the damage. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the skull.

### 14. Moa's Tomb

>>Skulls crusted with dried mud glower from niches cut into the walls of this tomb. A stone sarcophagus stands at the center of the chamber, its lid adorned with a coiled serpent carved in relief. Behind the sarcophagus, resting atop a marble pedestal, is an ornate crystal box with a small humanoid skull floating inside it.
>>

If the characters enter this tomb from the secret passage along the river, they see the concave inner surface of the stone skull at area 13.

A maze of tiny passages is cut into the walls beyond the niches, and any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear the faint yet grotesque scuttling of insects from within. Hundreds of tarantula-sized undead spiders crawl through these warrens.

#### Nepartak's Skull
The skull in the crystal box belongs to **Nepartak**, the 10-year-old granddaughter of Napaka, the last queen of Omu. The magic of the crystal box preserves her consciousness, but centuries of solitude and horror have caused her mind to blank out the details of her plight. The first character to enter the tomb hears **Nepartak** call out telepathically:

>>The voice of a young girl echoes in your mind: "What's happening? Why can't I see?"
>>

**Nepartak** magically senses the presence of intruders, using telepathy to question all the characters. Roleplay her as a terrified child lost in the dark. In her panic, she might ask any of the following questions:

- "Where am I? How did I get here?"
- "Why can't I see anything?"
- "Are you friends of my father? Is he looking for me?"

To safely explore this area, the characters must calm **Nepartak** without revealing her true predicament. Lying to her requires a successful DC 12 Charisma (Deception) check. If the characters reveal that she's nothing more than a disembodied skull, if they fail three Charisma checks to deceive her, of if they simply ignore her, **Nepartak** grows increasingly anxious, then flies into a murderous rage.

>>The voice shrieks in horror as the skull's eye sockets flare with green flame. With a shattering crash, the crystal box explodes and the skull levitates into the air.
>>

**Nepartak** has the statistics of a **flameskull** but doesn't speak, instead communicating using telepathy out to a range of 30 feet. When she attacks, swarms of mummified spiders pour out from the niches at the start of the following round.

#### Undead Spider Warrens
Six swarms of undead spiders inhabit the warrens within the walls of the tomb. They are treated as **swarms of insects (spiders)**, except that they are susceptible to effects that can target undead.

The warrens are too narrow for Medium and larger creatures to enter, and Small creatures must squeeze to traverse them (see "*Movement and Position*" in chapter 9 of the *Player's Handbook*). Tiny creatures can move through the warrens freely. The swarms attack any creatures that enter the warrens or any creatures in Moa's tomb if **Nepartak** becomes enraged.

#### Treasure
The stone sarcophagus isn't locked and can be opened with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Inside, a bundle of faded cloth holds the serpentine bones of a jaculi (the trickster god Moa's animal form; see *appendix D*). A *staff of the python* rests atop these remains. The staff turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see "Lost Treasures").

***Moa's Spirit.*** The spirit of Moa tries to inhabit any character who touches the staff (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods"). When Moa's spirit manifests, read:

>>Green smoke billows from the staff, coiling around you like a serpent. A sibilant voice whispers in your ear: "Let me help you! I promise to be good."
>>

If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Moa's card (see *appendix F*). If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the staff and waits for another character to touch it.

### 15. Wind Tunnel

>>Carved birds soar across the walls of this corridor. Blocking the passage near its northern end is a large adamantine propeller with five sharp blades.
>>

With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character discerns that the entire floor of the corridor is a single pressure plate. The adamantine propeller has AC 20, 30 hit points, and immunity to all damage except force damage. It thunders into motion whenever more than 20 pounds of pressure is placed on the corridor floor. Once activated, the propeller spins up to full speed in 6 seconds. If the weight is removed from the floor, the blades take a full minute to slow to a stop.

While the propeller is spinning up or slowing down, a creature can leap through a gap between two blades with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failed check, the character takes 33 (6d10) slashing damage as it passes through the blades.

At full speed, the propeller deals 66 (12d10) slashing damage to any creature that passes through it, and the blades are turning too fast for a creature to leap between them. The rapidly spinning propeller also creates a wind tunnel effect, such that any creature that comes within 10 feet of the propeller or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw. A creature that fails the save is hurled northward into the pit in area 16. If this forced movement causes the creature to pass through the propeller, the creature takes damage from the spinning blades.

One can jam the propeller by fixing an *immovable rod* in place between two of the blades. Other magic items wedged between the blades are knocked aside as the propeller turns. The propeller destroys all nonmagical objects lodged between its spinning blades.

While the propeller is motionless, a creature that isn't incapacitated can jam the mechanism with its body. When the propeller begins to turn, the creature must make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the propeller is jammed until the start of the creature's next turn, when it can use its action to repeat the check. A creature that fails the check or chooses to extricate itself takes 11 (2d10) slashing damage and is ejected north of the propeller.

If the propeller is jammed for 3 consecutive rounds, it breaks down and becomes nonfunctional. At dawn the next day, **Withers** sends tomb dwarves to repair the damage and return the trap to its operational state.

### 16. Wongo's Tomb

>>A deep pit opens up at the entrance to this tomb, with a stone sarcophagus resting at the bottom. A snarling monkey-like creature decorates the sarcophagus lid. Beyond the pit, three treasure chests sit on stone daises. The chest on the left is carved of black onyx, the middle chest is made of rusty iron, and the chest on the right is cast of silver and glistening with frost.
>>

The pit is 20 feet deep. To unlock Wongo's sarcophagus, the characters must turn three keys hidden inside the treasure chests.

#### Treasure Chests
Each chest is 5 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 3 feet high. All three are unlocked and (for the most part) empty. The chests cannot be moved, and they are impervious to damage and spells.

Opening any chest reveals a 3-inch-long gold key protruding from an adamantine keyhole set into the underside of the chest's lid. The key cannot be removed, and adamantine clamps prevent it from being turned while the chest is open. When the chest lid closes, a muffled click sounds from within the lid as the clamps around the key release. Any character who climbs inside a chest and closes its lid can turn its golden key with ease.

If a chest's key is turned while the chest is shut, the chest locks and the clamps snap shut on the key once more. Any character inside the chest when this happens is trapped. At the same time, a button magically appears on the lid of Wongo's sarcophagus.

#### Sarcophagus
The sarcophagus lid is carved with a stylized image of Wongo in his su-monster form (see *appendix D*) and has been melded to the rest of the sarcophagus with powerful magic. Consequently, the lid cannot be removed. The stone sarcophagus is impervious to damage and spells.

Whenever one of the three chests is locked, a carved button magically appears on the sarcophagus lid above the monstrous image of Wongo. The material of each button matches its corresponding chest: onyx, rusty iron, or silver. Pressing the button simultaneously unlocks the associated chest and triggers a trap within it:

- Pushing the onyx button forces any creature inside the onyx chest to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 75 (10d6 + 40) force damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage turns to a pile of dust, leaving behind whatever gear it was holding or wearing.
- Pushing the rusty iron button causes any nonmagical metal objects inside the rusty iron chest (including objects carried or worn by a creature in the chest) to corrode into worthless piles of rust. Objects partly made of metal are ruined as their metal components decay.
- Pushing the silver button causes any creature inside the silver chest to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Once all three buttons on the sarcophagus lid have been pressed, read:

>>The stone sarcophagus turns to transparent crystal, revealing a mummified monkey-like creature within. Clutched in its desiccated claws is a fearsome mace.
>>

When the sarcophagus turns crystalline, it becomes brittle, having AC 5, 10 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It shatters if reduced to 0 hit points, whereupon the su-monster **mummy** within animates and attacks. In its first round of combat, the mummy activates its *mace of terror* to unleash a wave of terror against the characters. Thereafter, it makes melee attacks using the mace or its rotting fists.

#### Treasure
Wongo's mummy clutches a *mace of terror*. The mace turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see "Lost Treasures").

***Wongo's Spirit.*** Wongo's spirit is bound to the mace. If the mace hits or otherwise comes into contact with any character, Wongo's spirit tries to inhabit that character (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods"). When Wongo's spirit manifests, read:

>>Red smoke seethes from the head of the mace, forming the outline of a monkey with a long tail. With a roar, the smoky apparition leaps at you, screaming, "Let me in!"
>>

If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Wongo's card (see *appendix F*). If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the mace and waits for another character to come into contact with it. The mummy is friendly toward any character inhabited by Wongo's spirit, treating that character as an ally.

### 17. Underground Waterfall

>>The underground river plunges down into a dark, rocky chasm. Cold air swirls up from below like the breath of some monstrous creature. Through the gloom, you spot an ornate treasure chest resting on a ledge opposite.
>>

The treasure chest is a **mimic** in disguise. If any creature touches it, the mimic attacks in object form.

#### Ledge
The ledge is 15 feet from the lip of the waterfall. A successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check is required to climb around to the ledge.

The ledge is slippery and uneven. Any creature that takes damage while standing on the ledge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the rift, plunging 100 feet into the water at area 64. The fall deals 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage, or no damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw.

## Level 2: Dungeon of Deception
Map 5.2 shows this level of the dungeon. Mocking devil faces are graven into the walls, and the air reeks of rotting flesh. With no light to nourish it, the vegetation that fills much of level 1 doesn't extend down here.

![[070-506a.webp|right|300]]
### 18. Devil Pit

>>The walls and floor of this fifteen-foot-square room are cracked and carved with images of terrified humanoids falling. Set into the middle of the floor is a stone bas-relief of a bearded devil face, painted green. Forlorn cries echo from the black void of its gaping maw.
>>

The devil face forms the mouth of a 5-foot-wide cylindrical shaft that descends 10 feet before opening up in the ceiling of area 35. Magical darkness fills the mouth and the shaft. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals auras of evocation and illusion magic within the shaft.

A successful *dispel magic* (DC 16) cast on the darkness dispels it. If the darkness is dispelled, its fading essence magically coalesces into a **swarm of bats** that flies up out of the shaft and attacks any creatures in the room.

### 19. Gravity Ring

>>At a four-way intersection, the corridors to north and south curve upward and out of sight, but with no rails or steps to allow them to be climbed. The corpse of a half-human, half-goat creature in robes sprawls ten feet to the north. It grips a staff tipped with a bronze goat's head.
>>

The curving corridor forms a perfect circle, imbued with magical gravity that keeps creatures bound to the floor as they walk along it. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation within the corridor.

The corpse belongs to Devlin Bashir, a Calishite wizard and member of the Company of the Yellow Banner. Devlin's goat-like features are the result of a curse, and he was killed by tomb dwarves after he became separated from his companions. Any inspection of his remains reveals that he was killed by wounds from axes and crossbow bolts. Devlin's ink-stained robes contain a journal that hints at the tomb's mysteries (see "Devlin's Journal" below). A search of the corpse also yields more valuable belongings (see "Treasure" below).

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Papazotl or Shagambi receive advice when entering this area:

- Bossy Papazotl urges his host to order another character to walk the length of the circular hall.
- Wise Shagambi warns her host that the staff held by the fallen wizard might be cursed.

#### Mirror Tomb
The halfway point of the circular corridor, directly "opposite" the intersection, is an invisible planar gate that cannot be detected with magic. Any creature passing through this gate emerges into a parallel reality. Characters who walk the length of the circular corridor notice that Devlin's body is no longer present—nor are any companions who waited behind for them. If they step back through the gate, they return to their own world.

To test his traps, **Acererak** crafted a "mirror tomb" and hid it inside a demiplane. This mirror tomb is identical to the real tomb as it stood exactly one year ago. All objects and creatures encountered in the mirror tomb appear real, but they fade away if taken to the real world. The mirror tomb has the same magical defenses as the true tomb, and any character who dies in the demiplane is trapped by the Soulmonger.

Each dawn, **Acererak**'s magic replaces the mirror tomb with a fresh fabrication. Slain monsters reappear in their original locations, and moved objects teleport back to where they were found. When this occurs, characters inside the mirror tomb witness a strange distortion ripple through the air.

#### Devlin's Journal
When the characters find Devlin's journal, give the players a copy of handout 21 in appendix E, showing the journal's final entry. Earlier entries chronicle the exploits of the Company of the Yellow Banner in Chult. The company made landfall at Kitcher's Inlet and followed the River Olung to Lake Luo before cutting southwest into the jungle toward Omu. The journal describes harrowing encounters, the adventurers' search for puzzle cubes in Omu, their brushes with the yuan-ti, and the discovery of the true tomb entrance. Only the final entry mentions their experiences in the tomb, but no mention is made of Devlin's staff (see "Treasure" below).

Any character who spends 10 minutes poring over the journal can note a few brief mentions of the other company members: Lord Brixton (a Cormyrean knight), Bravus Boulderborn (a gold dwarf cleric of Moradin), Seward (a Chondathan human ranger), and Sephirius (a dragonborn paladin often referred to as "Seph").

#### Treasure
A search of Devlin's body also turns up an ink pot that never runs dry (100 gp) and a spellbook containing the following spells:

1st level: *alarm*, *comprehend languages*, *detect magic*, *expeditious retreat*, *identify*, *illusory script*, *sleep*, *Tenser's floating disk*

2nd level: *arcane lock*, *cloud of daggers*, *flaming sphere*, *knock*

3rd level: *dispel magic*, *fireball*

Devlin's staff is a *staff of striking*, but any character who attunes to it transforms into a goat-humanoid hybrid over the course of 3 days. Tieflings are immune to this curse. Throughout the first day, shaggy fur begins to grow all over the cursed character's body. After 24 hours, the character's eyes become goat-like, and stumpy horns sprout from the brow. On the last day, the character's fingers and toes meld into double digits, and the horns grow to full length. This transformation doesn't prevent the character from wielding weapons or casting spells. *Remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or any other effect that ends a curse restores the character's original appearance, but only a *wish* spell can rid the staff of its power to transform those who attune to it.

### 20. False Tomb
Nested in the ceiling of the western tunnel is a stone block. A character who searches the tunnel spots the block with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The block is part of the room's trap (see "Trap" below).

>>This room smells of wine. On a checkerboard marble floor, a gilded coffin sparkles in sunlight streaming down from the chamber's vaulted ceiling, which arches twelve feet overhead. Four huge stone gargoyle heads, their mouths agape, protrude from the walls.
>>

Illusion magic generates the sunlight that shines on the coffin. This light is treated as real sunlight, and creatures averse to sunlight are affected by it. The gargoyle heads are 5 feet tall and 5 feet wide, with mouths that are 2 feet in diameter. Behind each head, an airtight stone valve blocks a crawlway. The valves remain closed until the room's trap activates, though a *knock* spell or a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check can force open a valve. Casting *dispel magic* on the illusory sunlight dispels it and prevents the trap from triggering.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Kubazan or Moa receive advice when entering this area:

- Spirited Kubazan tries to persuade his host to throw open the coffin lid and pummel whatever is inside.
- Truthful Moa points out that this tomb doesn't match the symbolism of any of his godly companions.

#### Trap
The closed coffin is stuck to the floor with *sovereign glue* and has a hinged lid. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the coffin. A wooden plaque inside the coffin reads "Drown your sorrows" in Common.

If the illusory sunlight falling from the ceiling strikes the plaque when the coffin is opened, the stone block in the corridor outside the room slowly descends, sealing the entrance in 6 seconds. A creature that wishes to enter or leave the tomb during this time can do so, moving up to its speed. If the creature ends its movement under the block, it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature manages to get out from under the block on the side it was moving toward. If the save fails, the creature takes 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage. If this damage reduces the creature's hit points to 0, it is crushed to a pulp; otherwise, the creature is shoved into the room. The block is impervious to damage and spells. When fully lowered, the block is air-tight and refuses to be budged.

Four enormous cisterns filled with red wine are hidden in the walls behind the gargoyle heads. When the stone block seals off the entrance, the valves behind the heads open, causing the wine to pour from the gargoyles' mouths and nostrils. The wine floods the tomb at a rate of 1 foot per round. Trying to crawl into a gargoyle's mouth while wine is gushing out of it requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.

As the wine begins pouring into the room, all creatures present must roll initiative. Track the passage of rounds:

- At the start of round 3, three wine weirds (use **water weird** statistics) flow into the tomb from the northwest, northeast, and southeast cisterns. The weirds attack anyone in the tomb and are invisible while fully immersed in wine.
- After 12 rounds, the wine fills the tomb. Use the underwater combat rules in *chapter 9* of the *Player's Handbook* to handle fighting in these conditions. Visibility within the wine is limited to 5 feet.

The ability to breathe water does not help a character drowning in wine. When 10 minutes have passed, the stone block sealing the tomb rises back up to its niche in the ceiling. The wine cascades down the west tunnel, pouring down the grand staircase (area 7). At dawn the next day, **Withers** sends tomb dwarves to clean up the room and tunnel, after which the wine cisterns magically refill and the trap resets.

#### Escape Tunnel
The southwest crawlway ascends to area 24. When the tomb floods with wine, the liquid reaches as far as the sloped section of the crawlway.

### 21. Zombie Door
Adventurers on the balcony hear guttural moans coming from this door.

>>Three oval holes are carved into a nine-foot-wide, nine-foot-high stone door at human head height. As you approach, three humanoid heads stick out of the holes, each covered in putrid flesh and gnashing on an iron bit bolted to a chain bridle.
>>

The gnashing heads belong to three **zombies** that are chained to a pulley bolted to the ceiling on the south side of the door. The pulley is set up in such a way that when all three zombies move away from the door, they heave it open. The zombies won't move while fresh meat tempts them from the balcony, but if they are successfully turned, they raise the door as they flee toward the south.

The door weighs 1,000 pounds. Characters with a combined Strength score of 33 or more can lift the door. The zombies attack any creatures they can reach. **Withers** and his tomb dwarves replace destroyed zombies within 24 hours.

### 22. Papazotl's Tomb

>>Six glass cauldrons brimming with humanoid bones line the walls of this tomb, at the center of which stands an ancient chariot bearing a bronze sarcophagus with treasure strewn atop it. Paintings on the chariot's body show a tall bird with a long, sharp beak. On the south wall, a bronze shield bears the embossed image of a Chultan warrior carrying a spear, below an inscription that reads, "Bow before no one." Four bronze statues stand on pedestals to either side of the shield. They depict Chultan warriors: one holding a sword, two with spears, and one missing its face.
>>

Papazotl's bones are contained within the sarcophagus, but they are well protected (see "Glass Cauldrons" and "Bronze Shield" below).

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Nangnang or Obo'laka receive advice when entering this area:

- Greedy Nangnang encourages her host to grab some of the treasure from the chariot.
- Nervous Obo'laka warns its host that the cauldrons contain the bones of Papazotl's most zealous devotees who, even in death, might seek to protect him.

#### Glass Cauldrons
Disturbing the chariot, the sarcophagus, or the treasure lying atop it causes twelve **skeletons** to crawl out of the glass cauldrons (two per cauldron). All the skeletons act on the same initiative count. A cauldron disgorges one additional **skeleton** at the start of the skeletons' turn each round until the cauldron is destroyed or the tomb is cleared of interlopers. When no enemies remain, any remaining skeletons return to the cauldrons.

Destroying the cauldrons stops the flow of skeletons, as does bowing before the faceless statue ("Bow before no one"). Each cauldron is a Large object with AC 15, 22 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of conjuration around the cauldrons. An empty cauldron weighs 500 pounds.

#### Bronze Shield
The bronze shield hangs from the wall on leather straps. It radiates conjuration magic to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect.

If the chariot, the sarcophagus, or the treasure is disturbed, or if the shield is removed from the wall, the hunter embossed on it animates. Each round on initiative count 20, it flings a magical spear of force at the nearest character it can see, ignoring any creature that has bowed before the faceless bronze statue. The hunter can't see any creature behind the front-facing side of the shield. When it hurls a spear at a creature, the hunter makes a ranged spell attack (+10 to hit) and deals 18 (4d8) force damage on a hit. A target reduced to 0 hit points by this attack is disintegrated and turns to dust.

To stop the shield's hunter from attacking, a character must blind it by draping something opaque over the shield (such as a sack or cloak) or turning the shield to face a wall. The shield can also be destroyed; it has AC 15, 10 hit points, and is immune to all damage except force damage. If taken from the room, the shield vanishes and reappears on the wall between the statues.

#### Sarcophagus
The sarcophagus contains the brittle skull and bones of an eblis (Papazotl's animal form; see *appendix D*).

#### Treasure
The following treasures are strewn atop the sarcophagus: a gold torc (250 gp), three gold cups (75 gp each), five gold cloak pins (25 gp each), and an *amulet of health*. The amulet turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see "Lost Treasures").

***Papazotl's Spirit.*** The spirit of Papazotl tries to inhabit any character who touches the *amulet of health* (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods"). When Papazotl's spirit manifests, read:

>>Strange shadows shift across the walls, forming the outline of a long-legged bird. Its beak stabs at you as a voice echoes through your mind: "You will do as I command!"
>>

If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Papazotl's card (see *appendix F*). If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the amulet and waits for another character to touch it.

### 23. Bottled Genie

>>Ancient cobwebs fill this narrow corridor, whose midpoint features an arched alcove. Within the alcove, a dusty bottle stands on a table.
>>

The bottle is stoppered and contains a **dao** named Keshma al-Wazir, who was trapped centuries ago by **Acererak**. Anyone examining the bottle spots the genie waving from within and hears her muffled voice calling out. Keshma speaks Terran only. At first, she orders the characters to release her. If they refuse, she tries to bargain with them (see "Roleplaying the Dao" below). While trapped inside the bottle, Keshma can't attack or cast spells. Once she's released, she can cast the *tongues* spell to better communicate with her liberators.

If the bottle is broken or unplugged, the dao emerges in a whirlwind of sand. She fulfills whatever promise she made to the characters in exchange for her freedom, then casts *plane shift* in an effort to return to the Elemental Plane of Earth. (The attempt fails, naturally, and she winds up trapped in area 57.)

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Moa, Nangnang, or Papazotl receive advice when seeing the genie in the bottle:

- Truthful Moa advises his host not to break any bargains made with the dao.
- Greedy Nangnang advises her host to cut deals with the dao that benefit only the host and her.
- Proud Papazotl encourages his host to treat the dao like a servile lickspittle.

#### Roleplaying the Dao
Decades of imprisonment have done little to dent Keshma's imperious nature. As befits a dao, she regards the characters as lesser creatures and bargains with them only if they refuse her commands.

At first, Keshma promises the characters riches in exchange for freedom—the sapphires coiled through her braided hair and the platinum armbands (see "Treasure" below). Such baubles mean little to the dao in the greater scheme of things, but she feigns anguish in surrendering them. If the characters press for more, Keshma promises to take them anywhere in the multiverse. Finally, she offers to travel with them through the tomb and aid them three times with her spells.

Once freed, Keshma remains true to her word. However, she won't tolerate any slight to her honor. If she feels insulted, she attacks the characters and attempts to enslave them.

The dao could become a thorn in the characters' side or a difficult ally. Her ignorance of the tomb's defenses confines her to area 57 if she casts *plane shift*. If she escapes from area 57, she expects the characters to help her find a safe way out of the tomb. When she learns of the trickster gods, Keshma encourages the characters to seek them out and use them to defeat **Acererak**.

#### Treasure
The dao wears two sapphire cords (1,250 gp each), two platinum armbands engraved with dueling dragons (750 gp each), and a topaz belly-button gemstone (500 gp).

### 24. Nangnang's Tomb

>>The air here reeks of sulfur and brimstone. On the floor of this chamber, a pentagram traced in salt surrounds an ornate sarcophagus, its lid covered with figurines of prancing frog-like humanoids.
>>

An invisible **gray slaad** paces inside the salt pentagram. Magical wards prevent the slaad from disturbing the salt or leaving the circle's confines. If another creature attacks the slaad, enters the area of the boundary circle, or breaks any part of the circle or pentagram by sweeping or brushing away the salt, the slaad is freed. Hungry for carnage, the creature vents its rage on the characters before leaving the room in search of its control gem, not knowing that it is kept in area 28.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Obo'laka or Wongo receive advice when entering this area:

- Cautious Obo'laka thinks the salt pentagram could use more salt and encourages her host to add to it, if any salt is available. (Doing so doesn't break the wards that trap the slaad.)
- Reckless Wongo doesn't care much for salt pentagrams, and he urges his host to wreck the symbol and see what happens.

#### Sarcophagus
Arranged atop the sarcophagus are twelve painted wooden statuettes depicting grungs. They are cute but worthless. The lid of the sarcophagus can be lifted and pushed aside with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check. Within is a varnished clay urn containing the skull and bones of a grung (Nangnang's animal form; see *appendix D*), as well as a number of valuables (see "Treasure" below).

A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding the clay urn. The first creature to touch the urn or disturb its contents must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by an *Otto's irresistible dance* spell. Until the effect ends, the creature also takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage at the end of each of its turns as discordant, percussive music overwhelms its mind. Any creature under the effect of a *mind blank* spell or similar magic doesn't hear this music or suffer the psychic damage. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 18) dismisses the effect on the urn, allowing it to be touched safely.

#### Treasure
Inside the sarcophagus are a *potion of poison* disguised as a *potion of supreme healing* and a petrified grung egg that functions as a *pearl of power*. A spellcaster that attunes to the egg also gains resistance to poison damage. The egg turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see "Lost Treasures").

***Nangnang's Spirit.*** The spirit of Nangnang tries to inhabit any character who touches the egg (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods"). When Nangnang's spirit manifests, read:

>>As you touch the egg, a tendril of slime rises from its surface and transforms into a frog-like head that bobs toward you. A croaking voice sounds out in your mind: "Nangnang will help you now."
>>

If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Nangnang's card (see *appendix F*). If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the egg and waits for another character to touch it.

### 25. Scrying Pool

>>Behind the secret door, water fills a carved stone font.
>>

**Withers** uses this font to speak to creatures outside the tomb and contact his **tomb guardian**. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of divination over the water. When any character gazes into the font, read:

>>As the water begins to swirl, eerie light emanates from within the basin. Slowly, an image resolves on the water's surface.
>>

Those gazing into the font can see through the eyes of a random tomb guardian as it patrols the dungeon. Pick a random level (or roll a d6) and describe the guardian's path through it. The guardian relies on darkvision to see, so images in the pool are in black and white. The images fade and the scrying effect ends if no character gazes into the water.

Unless one of the characters gazing into the pool is wearing an *amulet of the black skull* (see *appendix C* and area 28), the tomb guardian becomes aware of the party's scrying after 1 minute. When that happens, read:

>>The surface of the pool explodes, and a hulking figure wearing plate armor and a bucket helm heaves itself up from the font.
>>

The **tomb guardian** is a **flesh golem** clad in plate armor (AC 17). As it emerges from the font, it attacks everyone in the chamber, fighting until destroyed. When the guardian appears, the pool loses its scrying power until the next dawn.

### 26. Spiral Staircase

>>Three archways overlook a circular chamber where a spiral staircase descends into darkness. The staircase walls are lined with unlit torches in iron sconces and set with niches containing moldering humanoid skulls and bones.
>>

This staircase descends from level 2 to levels 3, 4, and 5, with each level 25 feet below the level above. The bones and skulls in the niches belong to dead Omuans whom **Acererak** sacrificed to build the tomb. **Withers** and his tomb dwarves use these stairs to move between levels.

The torches can be removed from their brackets and taken elsewhere.

### 27. Forge of the Tomb Dwarves

>>Old wooden benches and shelves along the walls of this chamber are covered with gears, chains, trap components, and cages filled with rats. Lit iron braziers hang by chains from the ceiling. Along the north wall, a stepped dais is set with a bulky contraption: an iron maiden of sorts, attached to a network of steaming pistons, tubes, and bubbling vats of blood. Five masked dwarves operate the contraption.
>>

![[071-504.webp|right|300]]

When the characters arrive, five tomb dwarves are working inside the chamber. Each one has the statistics of a **wight**, except that it wields a battleaxe and a light crossbow. If the adventurers leave this area, there's a 50 percent chance that 1d4 of the other tomb dwarves prowling the dungeon are present when they return.

Any character who searches the forge uncovers enough gear to assemble two sets of thieves' tools, a set of artisan's tools, a set of alchemist's supplies, a set of mason's tools, and a set of smith's tools. The caged rats are used to test traps.

#### Iron Kiln
The dwarves use the iron contraption on the dais to craft **tomb guardians** from the corpses of slain adventurers. As the characters arrive, the tomb dwarves are in the process of unleashing their newest creation.

>>The iron contraption shudders as it opens, releasing a hissing cloud of steam. Through the roiling vapor, an armored figure wearing a bucket helm stomps into view.
>>

![[072-507.webp|right|300]]

The creature that emerges from the contraption is a **tomb guardian**—a **flesh golem** encased in plate armor (AC 17). This guardian was fashioned using the salvaged remains of Seward, an adventurer with the Company of the Yellow Banner, and a number of other unfortunate trespassers. Now a mindless undead, it attacks the characters on sight.

#### Treasure
Any character who searches the forge finds a *ghost lantern* (see *appendix C*) that once belonged to Seward. It lies on a bench next to some tools.

The spirit of a female moon elf warlock known as the Starfallen resides within the *ghost lantern*. If any character touches the lantern, the spirit can be seen within it. The spirit is insubstantial and can't be harmed, nor can it cause harm. It speaks and understands Common, Elvish, and Sylvan. If the lantern is destroyed, the spirit becomes trapped in the Soulmonger.

The Starfallen was slain almost a thousand years ago by a fomorian. After her death, her soul inhabited the lantern. The Company of the Yellow Banner found the lantern and began questing for a way to return the Starfallen to life. The fabled Eye of Zaltec was said to possess the power to raise the ancient dead. The company tracked the jewel to the tomb and perished without ever finding it.

The spirit of the Starfallen has weakened over time and grown forgetful. She remembers little of her past or her travels with the Company of the Yellow Banner, but certain things might jog her memory. If the players get stuck, you can use the Starfallen as a means to provide hints to keep the adventure on track.

### 28. Withers's Office

>>Candles dimly illuminate a cluttered office. A skeletal songbird rasps at you from a filthy cage in one corner. Other furnishing include a wooden writing desk and a tall-backed chair. Anatomical drawings sketched in charcoal hang on the wall behind the desk. Seated in the chair is the shriveled corpse of a humanoid wearing moldy robes and a bronze mask sculpted to look like a frowning visage. Around the figure's neck hangs a black skull-shaped amulet, and a number of severed hands crawl on the desk and floor around him.
>>

![[073-508.webp|right|300]]

Before he was turned into an undead creature, **Withers** was an Omuan engineer named Gorra. Like all of Omu's citizens, Gorra was enslaved and put to work constructing the tomb. When **Acererak** sacrificed his workers to their own dungeon, Gorra's traps performed the best. This pleased the archlich enough that he transformed Gorra into a **wight**, with these changes:

- **Withers** has an Intelligence of 16 (+3).
- He wears an *amulet of the black skull* (see *appendix C*) and doesn't carry a longbow.
- He has the Spellcasting feature described below.
- He has a challenge rating of 4 (1,100 XP).

>***Spellcasting.*** **Withers** is a 9th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13; +5 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

>Cantrips (at will): *acid splash*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*

>1st level (4 slots): *detect magic*, *expeditious retreat*, *feather fall*, *thunderwave*

>2nd level (3 slots): *darkness*, *hold person*, *rope trick*

>3rd level (3 slots): *dispel magic*, *lightning bolt*

>4th level (3 slots): *blight*, *wall of fire*

>5th level (1 slot): *telekinesis*

When the characters arrive, **Withers** is working at his desk. Seven **crawling claws** follow him around and obey his commands.

**Withers** is fiercely loyal to **Acererak**. His passion for learning followed him into undeath, granting him a rare chance to study for eternity. The walls of his office are covered in papers on natural history and anatomy, and he uses the scrying pool in area 25 to study the natural world through the eyes of Omu's gargoyles.

When he encounters the characters, **Withers** is keen to learn everything he can before killing them. He's particularly interested in current affairs in Chult and in the history of foreign lands. If the characters humor him, he behaves cordially while they answer his questions. Then with some regret, he finally announces that it's time for them to die. **Withers** would rather escape than be destroyed or captured, so he uses his spells to retreat if the battle goes against him, saving *wall of fire* to cut off pursuers when he flees.

#### Journals
**Withers** is a diligent scribe. His moldy journals track the history of Omu and the Tomb of the Nine Gods, and detail the arrival of the atropal and the construction of the Soulmonger. Any character who spends 10 minutes flipping through the journals finds an entry that stands out. Give that character's player a copy of handout 22 in appendix E. To flesh out the journals further, refer to the "History of Omu" section in chapter 3 and "History of the Tomb" earlier in this chapter.

#### Treasure
**Withers** has enough equipment on his desk to assemble a scholar's pack. A *manual of golems* (clay) lies open on his desk next to a spellbook containing all the spells he has prepared. On the inside back cover of the spellbook is what appears to be a name: Khomara Blackfire. "Khomara" and "Blackfire" are actually the command words for the *mirror of life trapping* in area 50.

The desk drawer contains a translucent, fist-sized gray stone that radiates an aura of enchantment to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. This stone is the control gem for the gray slaad in area 24. For more information on control gems, see the "Slaadi" entry in the *Monster Manual*.

**Withers**'s skeletal songbird is tame but cantankerous. It can't fly, but it can be sold to a buyer in Port Nyanzaru for 75 gp. **Withers**'s bronze mask is worth 25 gp.

## Level 3: Vault of Reflection
Map 5.3 shows this level of the dungeon, which an invisible beholder named Belchorzh the Unseen (see area 44) claims as its home. It doesn't have access to lair actions and regional effects; instead, it has infected its home with weird alien growth.

![[075-509a.webp|right|300]]
#### Alien Growth
The beholder's aberrant influence permeates the stonework across this level of the tomb, causing purple mold to sprout from the floors, walls, and ceilings. The mold smells like rotting corpses and occasionally releases clouds of harmless spores. As characters move through areas with alien growth, tiny eyeballs emerge from the mold to scrutinize them. Belchorzh can see through these eyes and uses them to track the party's progress.

Any effect that deals fire, necrotic, or radiant damage destroys a patch of alien growth on contact. However, the beholder doesn't take kindly to the mold's destruction. When a patch of growth is destroyed, the next nearest patch sprouts a stubby eyestalk that shoots a randomly determined eye ray at the nearest character. (Roll a d10 and consult the **beholder** stat block to determine which ray it produces.) After making this attack, the eyestalk quickly disappears back into the mold.

### 29. Jackal Mask

>>A huge carving of a snarling jackal's head protrudes from the wall at the end of this corridor. A chamber is visible through the gaps between its fangs.
>>

The gaps between the teeth are only 2 inches wide, but any character who looks through can see into area 35:

>>Four torches illuminate stone sphinxes crouched in the corners of this fifteen-foot-high room. The torches cast flickering light across hieroglyphs carved into the tiled floor. At the center of the room, a gold-inlaid funeral barge stands atop a three-foot-tall stone dais. Resting on the deck of the barge is a small golden sarcophagus decorated with horned rabbits. A dark shaft opens in the ceiling directly above the barge.
>>

This view is a magical window into the past. Whoever looks through the jackal's jaws sees a vision of I'jin's tomb (area 35) as it was just before the last person entered it. After a few moments, the vision reveals a person entering the chamber.

>>A slab of wall suddenly grinds upward to the east, and a dwarf wearing a turban and chain mail creeps into the tomb. He brandishes a shield in front of him as he treads cautiously across the floor.
>>

The magic here records the last moments of Bravus Boulderborn, hero of the Company of the Yellow Banner. The dwarf ignores any attempts by the characters to communicate with him.

>>A loud click sounds out as the dwarf steps onto one of the floor tiles. Then a deafening buzzing rises as locusts pour out from the mouths of the sphinx statues, quickly engulfing him. He tries to fight them off, to no avail. When the cloud of insects vanishes, nothing of the dwarf remains except its bones and gear.
>>

If all the characters turn away, the vision resets. When any character next looks through the mask, the dwarf is seen entering I'jin's tomb once more.

The jackal mask radiates an aura of divination to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. If any character uses teleportation or other magic to bypass the teeth and enter the tomb, the dwarf's moldering skeleton is discovered in area 35.

### 30. Iron Barrier

>>Ahead of you, the face of a snarling minotaur is etched into a sheet of iron that bisects the crawlway. Its eyes have been cut out, letting you see through the sheet, beyond which the tunnel continues onward.
>>

The minotaur face is etched into both sides of a 1-inch-thick, sharp-edged iron sheet that blocks the crawlway. The holes that form the eyes are 2 inches wide. The characters can use spells such as *gaseous form* and *misty step* to move past the iron sheet.

Any character who examines the barrier discovers that it slides up into the ceiling. Coiled springs provide resistance, and a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to lift the sheet. If the check succeeds, a hidden latch locks the sheet in place, allowing creatures to crawl underneath it. Unless it is wedged in place with an iron spike, a stout weapon, or a similar object, the barrier snaps down after 1 minute, sealing the crawlway once more. Any creature underneath the sheet when it snaps shut must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 44 (8d10) slashing damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is chopped in two.

### 31. Reflected Hall
A curtain of water separates two hallways that are basically mirror images of one another. When characters enter the first hall, read:

>>Still puddles of water cover the floor of this fifteen-foot-wide hallway. The walls are slick with moisture and set with murals showing animal-headed humanoids in armor, most of which appear to brandish real weapons hanging on the walls. A three-foot-high crawlway in the east wall is flush with the floor. At the far end of the hall, a rippling, transparent curtain of water fills a stone archway. Beyond the curtain, you see another hallway that looks similar to the one in which you stand.
>>

The tarnished weapons hanging on the walls are in poor condition and are held in place with hooks to make it appear as though the painted warriors are holding them.

Twelve painted figures line each hall, six on the west wall and six on the east wall, directly across from one another. Figures on facing walls are perfect reflections of each other.

***South Hall.*** From south to north, the warriors and weapons in this hall are as follows:

- Stork-headed males with handaxes (the figure on the east wall has the crawlway to area 36 between its legs)
- Lizard-headed females with maces
- Panther-headed males with blowguns
- Unarmed hawk-headed females (the east mural is illusory; see area 31A)
- Goat-headed males with sickles
- Frog-headed females with tridents

***North Hall.*** From south to north, the warriors and weapons in this hall are as follows:

- Frog-headed females with tridents
- Goat-headed males with sickles
- Unarmed hawk-headed females (the east mural is illusory; see area 31A)
- Panther-headed males with blowguns
- Lizard-headed females with maces
- Stork-headed males with handaxes (the figure on the east wall has the crawlway to area 32 between its legs)

#### 31A. Hidden Alcoves
Two alcoves are hidden behind 5-foot-wide, 8-foot-tall illusions of damp stone walls bearing paintings of hawk-headed female warriors. Touching the surface of either section of wall reveals that its stones and the images on them are illusions.

Each alcove contains a plinth bearing a crystal eyeball 1 inch in diameter: a pale purple eyeball to the south and a bright green eyeball to the north.

***Crystal Eyes.*** The nonmagical crystal eyes are two of the ten keys needed to open the vault of the beholder (area 44).

#### 31B. Curtain of Water
Clear water forms a 1-foot-thick, 7-foot-high, 10-foot-wide curtain between the two hallways, radiating an aura of conjuration magic to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 17) cast on the curtain causes it to vanish, leaving the archway open. The curtain magically reappears after 1 hour.

If any creature passes through the curtain of water carrying a trident, nothing happens. Any trident will do, not just the ones in the hallways.

If any creature passes through the curtain without a trident, the water erupts as a fierce wave flowing north and south. Any creature in either hall is slammed by the water and must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and is swept to the end of the hall with such great force that it falls prone. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half damage and falls prone, but is not swept away. The weapons hooked on the walls remain where they are.

Water expelled by the curtain disappears before it can flow beyond the confines of the hallways. The water also does not enter either of the hidden alcoves (area 31A), so creatures there are safe from the waves' effect.

The water conjured by the curtain leaks out of the hall through tiny cracks in the floor, leaving puddles behind.

### 32. Rotating Crawlways
Any character searching for traps or secret doors in this tunnel notices a narrow seam in the stonework with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. This seam marks one end of a 25-foot-long section of crawlway (marked "Tunnel A" on map 5.3) that rotates. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character can deduce that the seam represents a point where two sections of tunnel can detach from one another.

When 50 pounds or more of weight is applied to the floor at the midpoint of tunnel A, a mechanism causes the tunnel to quickly rotate 90 degrees clockwise and sink 5 feet as it turns. Both ends of the tunnel are immediately cut off, trapping creatures inside. At the same time, a second crawlway perpendicular to the first (marked "Tunnel B" on map 5.3) rotates 90 degrees clockwise and sinks into place, positioned where tunnel A used to be. Characters who are flying, in gaseous form, or otherwise effectively weightless do not trigger the trap and can move through the tunnel safely.

#### Rotating Tunnel
Read the following text to players the first time their characters are caught in a rotating tunnel:

>>With a loud grinding noise, this section of crawlway begins to rotate, instantly cutting off the exits ahead and behind. You can feel the passage sink about five feet as it turns. After a few seconds, it comes to a stop and the grinding abates.
>>

When tunnel B connects to the rest of the crawlway, a new passage running north to south is formed. Tunnel B is trapped similarly to tunnel A, except that both tunnels ascend 5 feet as they rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise when the trap triggers. The only way to return tunnel A to its original position is to trigger the trap from tunnel B, and vice versa.

Characters trapped in a section of tunnel not connected to the rest of the crawlway have no clear means of escape. The tunnel is airtight. A single creature consumes the available air supply in 24 hours, with multiple creatures dividing that time up between them. For example, four creatures trapped in the tunnel could survive 6 hours before they begin to suffocate.

#### Skeletal Remains
Any character who can see into tunnel B notices the body of an unlucky adventurer.

>>As a new tunnel rotates into place, you see a skeletal corpse lying on the floor of that tunnel, about ten feet away.
>>

The corpse belongs to Sephirius, dragonborn paladin of the Company of the Yellow Banner. Looting the body reveals several items of interest (see "Treasure" below).

#### Treasure
Sephirius wore no armor but carried a *+1 yklwa* (see "Buying a Special Item" in chapter 1 for more information on this weapon), a dungeoneer's pack, a pouch containing 8 gp, an ivory back scratcher shaped like a dinosaur claw (25 gp), a holy symbol of Bahamut (25 gp), and a red crystal eyeball measuring 1 inch in diameter.

***Crystal Eye.*** The nonmagical crystal eye is one of the ten keys needed to open the vault of the beholder (area 44).

### 33. Chamber of Opposition

>>This chamber contains a stone font filled with a steaming green liquid. Beyond it, a shadowy figure stands at an open door on the far side of the room. The figure's back is toward you.
>>

The stone font is attached to the floor and can't be tipped over. It is also impervious to damage and spells. It appears to hold 40 pints (5 gallons) of hot soup, but the liquid is illusory. Tactile exploration reveals that the liquid has no substance and the font is dry.

The dark figure is a magical, illusory duplicate of whichever character opened the door to the room. It copies the character's movements, allowing a shrewd player to use the duplicate to dispense with the liquid in the font. The shadow duplicate has the statistics of a **commoner** and is immune to poison damage. It perfectly matches the motions of the character who created it, always keeping its back to its creator as though it was a projected image 15 feet ahead.

If the character who created the shadow duplicate moves backward, the duplicate moves toward the font. If the character then mimes drinking from the font, the duplicate slurps up the "soup" at a rate of 5 pints per round, draining the font in 8 rounds. Once the font is drained of illusory soup, a treasure appears in the font that wasn't there before (see "Treasure" below). Casting *dispel magic* on the font causes the illusory soup to vanish, but the treasure does not appear. The illusory soup reappears 1 minute later.

The shadow duplicate can't exert pressure on objects and glides through any obstacles it encounters. Casting *dispel magic* on the figure causes it to vanish. It doesn't react to taking damage but disappears if it drops to 0 hit points or is made to leave the chamber. Closing the door to the room and reopening it creates a new duplicate of whoever opened the door. There can be only one shadow duplicate at a time.

The shadow duplicate has a terrible and deadly aspect. Any creature that looks upon its face sees a horrific visage locked in a silent scream and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. A creature that cannot be frightened automatically succeeds on the saving throw.

#### Treasure
If a shadow duplicate drinks all the illusory soup in the font, a 1-inch-diameter eyeball made of incandescent orange crystal appears at the bottom of the font and can easily be removed. If the eye is taken from the font and later put back, it disappears and the illusory soup effect is reset.

***Crystal Eye.*** The nonmagical crystal eye is one of the ten keys needed to open the vault of the beholder (area 44).

#### Empty Closet
East of the font is a dusty, empty room.

### 34. Peephole
If one or more characters approach this area from the south, read:

>>The corridor turns sharply to the left. At the corner just before the turn, a peephole is carved into the stone wall at a height of 6 feet.
>>

The peephole forms one end of a 5-foot-long tube cut through the solid rock wall. Magnifying lenses set throughout the tube give anyone who peers through the hole a clear view of the gold medallion in area 35A and the hieroglyph visible on the dial behind it. In addition, a creature looking through the peephole can communicate telepathically with creatures in area 35B. Using the peephole, a character can identify the correct sequence of floor tiles to step on in area 35B and communicate that information to everyone in I'jin's tomb.

### 35. I'jin's Tomb
Characters can reach this area via area 18, by lowering the stone block in the east wall (area 35A), or by slipping between the teeth of the jackal visage at area 29.

#### 35A. Stone Block
A 5-foot-wide, 5-foot-thick, 12-foot-tall block of solid stone fills the doorway leading to I'jin's tomb (area 35B). The block is featureless on the side that faces the tomb, and it is impervious to damage and spells. If the characters approach the block from the east, read:

>>The corridor ends at a block of stone on which is painted a seven-foot-tall jackal-headed humanoid with a circular gold medallion around its neck. All around the figure are carvings of locusts.
>>

Close inspection reveals that one of the carved locusts is a button that can be pushed. When this happens, the stone block sinks into the floor, creating an open passage to the tomb (area 35B).

The "medallion" worn by the jackal-headed painting is actually a 6-inch-diameter gold disk engraved with the face of a horned devil, its mouth agape. Lodged behind this disk is a clay dial etched with eight hieroglyphs. One hieroglyph (a vulture) is visible through a hole that forms the devil's gaping mouth, but the dial is locked in place and its remaining seven hieroglyphs are hidden from view behind the medallion.

If any character steps on a vulture floor tile in area 35B, the dial turns, revealing a new hieroglyph: a serpent. One hieroglyph at a time, the dial reveals the correct sequence of floor tiles to stand on: vulture, serpent, door, reed, scarab, scepter, foot, and urn. Stepping on a floor tile that matches the hieroglyph on the dial causes the dial to turn, revealing the next symbol in the sequence.

The gold medallion is attached to the stone block with *sovereign glue*, and removing it requires *universal solvent*. However, one can simply destroy the medallion to get at the dial underneath. Removing or destroying the medallion exposes the dial and its eight hieroglyphs.

Once the medallion is out of the way, the dial can be easily removed from its spoke inside the stone block. However, removing the dial releases a corrosive gas trapped within the block. The gas escapes through tiny holes hidden behind the dial and fills the 5-foot space directly east of the block. Any creature in this area when the gas is released must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A character who searches for traps can detect the holes hidden behind the dial with a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check; once found, these holes can be plugged with wax before the dial is removed, preventing the gas from escaping.

#### 35B. Tomb

>>Four torches illuminate stone sphinxes crouched in the corners of this fifteen-foot-high room. The torches cast flickering light across hieroglyphs carved into the tiled floor. At the center of the room, a gold-inlaid funeral barge stands atop a three-foot-tall stone dais. Resting on the deck of the barge is a small golden sarcophagus decorated with horned rabbits. A dark shaft opens in the ceiling directly above the barge, while to the south, a corridor is visible through a set of fangs carved into the wall.
>>
>>The skeleton of a dwarf sprawls on the floor east of the barge, clad in a tattered yellow turban and dusty chain mail, and clutching a bronze shield.
>>

To unlock I'jin's sarcophagus, eight floor tiles must be stepped on in the correct sequence (see "Hieroglyphic Floor" below and handout 23 in appendix E). Stepping on the tiles in the wrong order triggers a trap (see "Sphinx Statues" below).

The skeletal remains were once Bravus Boulderborn, a gold dwarf cleric of Moradin and former member of the Company of the Yellow Banner. Bravus died as a result of stepping on floor tiles in the wrong order, and his body lies atop a floor tile bearing the "foot" hieroglyph. A search of the body yields some valuables (see "Treasure" below).

Four torches light the room. As long as they remain in their brackets, they never burn out. If a torch is removed from its bracket, it burns down normally.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Nangnang or Shagambi receive advice when entering this area:

- Skittish yet greedy Nangnang wants her host to loot the corpse of the dead dwarf before anyone else can.
- Wise Shagambi suggests that there might be a clue nearby to suggest which floor tiles are safe to walk on.

#### Hieroglyphic Floor
The floor around the dais and the statues is covered with 5-foot-square stone tiles, each one etched with a hieroglyph. Give the players handout 23 in appendix E.

Characters can avoid triggering the floor tiles by flying or by climbing along the walls and ceiling. Climbing the walls requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Those who set foot on the tiles must traverse them in the proper sequence or suffer the consequences.

If any character steps onto a tile and the passage to the east is open, the stone block at area 35A rises to seal the tunnel. Any creature atop the block when it meets the ceiling must succeed on a DC 7 Dexterity saving throw to leap clear in one direction or the other. On a failed save, the creature takes 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is crushed to a pulp. Otherwise, the creature falls prone inside the tomb.

The correct sequence of floor tiles matches the order in which the hieroglyphs appear on the clay dial in area 35A: vulture, serpent, door, reed, scarab, scepter, foot, urn. Each time a character steps on a correct floor tile, a new hieroglyph clicks into view on the clay dial, with that view accessible by any character using the peephole in area 34. The dial rotates through all the hieroglyphs in the correct order. If any character steps on a hieroglyph out of order, the statues react as described in "Sphinx Statues." Stepping on the wrong tile does not reset the sequence.

When the final tile in the sequence is stepped on, the following things all happen at once:

- I'jin's sarcophagus opens.
- The stone block at area 35A sinks into the floor, creating an open passage to the east.
- Any locusts conjured by the sphinx statues are dispelled.
- The hieroglyphic floor is disabled. After 24 hours, **Withers** sends 1d4 tomb dwarves to reset the trap.

#### Sphinx Statues
Each of these statues depicts a life-size gynosphinx, and all four radiate auras of abjuration and conjuration to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. The statues are impervious to damage and spells.

When any creature steps on an incorrect floor tile, all four statues yawn and masses of magically summoned locusts fly out of their mouths. The locusts form a single cloud that fills a 15-foot cube centered above the offending floor tile. Each creature in the cloud when it forms, as well as any creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, takes 44 (8d10) piercing damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this trap is killed and eaten to the bone by the devouring locusts. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until another cloud of locusts is created.

#### Sarcophagus
I'jin's golden sarcophagus cannot be opened by any means other than stepping on eight floor tiles in the correct order. The sarcophagus is worth 7,500 gp intact but weighs 75 pounds. Removing it from the funeral barge causes four floor-to-ceiling walls of force (like those created by a *wall of force* spell) to surround the dais on all four sides. The walls last until destroyed or until the sarcophagus is returned to the barge.

The sarcophagus contains the fragile bones of an almiraj (I'jin's animal form; see *appendix D*), as well as its spiral horn, which functions as a *wand of wonder*. The horn turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see "Lost Treasures").

***I'jin's Spirit.*** The spirit of I'jin tries to inhabit any character who touches the horn (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods"). When I'jin's spirit manifests, read:

>>Streamers of light emanate from the tip of the horn. As they swirl around you, they form into a spectral rabbit with a single horn on its brow. A female voice whispers, "Quick, quick, let me in! We must stop **Acererak**!"
>>

If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player I'jin's card (see *appendix F*). If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the horn and waits for another character to touch it.

#### Treasure
Bravus's yellow turban is set with a peridot gemstone (500 gp). A search of Bravus's corpse also yields a nonmagical shield and a belt pouch containing a 500 gp diamond (the material component of a *raise dead* spell) and two 1-inch-diameter crystal eyeballs—one dark blue and one vibrant purple.

***Crystal Eyes.*** The nonmagical crystal eyes are two of the ten keys needed to open the vault of the beholder (area 44).

### 36. Chamber of Respite
The tomb's keepers have all but forgotten this tiny room lodged between two crawlways. Characters who shelter here are rewarded with undisturbed rest.

### 37. Winds of Pandemonium

>>Two balconies face each other over a vast pit. Between the balconies hover five wooden platforms, each one a disk ten feet across. A single torch burns above each balcony. On the east balcony stands a rough-hewn, fifteen-foot-tall statue of a hulking fiend with furled wings and clenched fists. Set into the wall on the west balcony is a rusty lever in the up position.
>>

Climbing the walls requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A crawlway is set into the northwest corner, at the same height as the balconies and floating platforms. Another crawlway extends off the east balcony. At the back of the west balcony, a staircase descends 10 feet to a landing and a secret door.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of I'jin or Kubazan receive advice when entering this area:

- Fickle I'jin urges her host to pull the lever. What harm could it do?
- Fearless Kubazan insists that his host jump to the platforms, even if others are better equipped to do so.

#### Floating Platforms
The circular wooden platforms are 10 feet in diameter and hover between 6 and 12 feet apart, as shown on map 5.3. They float at the same level as the balconies, 15 feet below the ceiling and 60 feet above the pit floor. A *detect magic* spell or similar magic reveals auras of abjuration and transmutation around each platform. Each disk is wide enough that characters can move 10 feet before jumping (see "*Movement*" in chapter 8 of the *Player's Handbook*). The platforms bob slightly when anything lands on them, as though they were floating on water. Any creature that falls from a platform to the pit floor takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. Casting *dispel magic* on a platform causes it to fall.

#### Wailing Winds
If the lever on the west balcony is pulled, the fiendish statue unclenches its fists to reveal a marble-sized object in the palm of each hand (see "Treasure" below). Simultaneously, howling winds rise up and fill the room. Returning the lever to its original up position causes the winds to abate and the statue's fists to close.

Have all party members roll initiative whenever the winds begin to howl. While the winds are howling, any creature not standing on a floating platform that starts its turn in the room must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, the winds cause creatures in the room to suffer disadvantage on all Strength-based skill checks, including checks made to jump to and from the floating platforms and checks made to climb the walls.

#### Statue
Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that the statue depicts a nycaloth. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals auras of transmutation magic radiating from the statue's clenched fists.

The statue weighs 15,000 pounds and is impervious to damage and spells. Casting a *knock* spell on the statue causes one of its fists to unclench for 1 round, during which time the object in that hand can be safely removed.

#### Treasure
The statue clutches a 1-inch-diameter pearly white crystal eyeball in its left hand and a similarly sized scarlet crystal eyeball in its right hand.

***Crystal Eyes.*** The nonmagical crystal eyes are two of the ten keys needed to open the vault of the beholder (area 44).

### 38. Revolving Room Trap
Three separate areas comprise this section of the tomb: a control room (area 38A), an access corridor (area 38B), and a revolving death trap (area 38C). Diagram 5.2 shows a side view of these areas.

![[076-510.webp|right|300]]

#### 38A. Control Room

>>This room is dark and dusty. A hulking figure wearing a bucket helm stands to the west, with one hand on an iron lever set into the wall. The south wall is sloped and has a large rectangular window five feet wide by seven feet high. The window looks into a hallway, through a rectangular hole in the hallway floor, and farther down into a well-lit room shaped like a cylinder tipped on its side.
>>

The helmed figure is a **tomb guardian**: a **flesh golem** clad in plate armor (AC 17). Its task is to pull the lever when it sees adventurers enter area 38C. The tomb guardian fights only in self-defense and has orders from **Withers** to not leave the control room. If it goes berserk, it ignores these orders.

***Window.*** The window in the south wall is stone magically rendered transparent from this side only. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 17) cast on the stone causes it to lose its transparency. If the tomb guardian is prevented from seeing into areas 38B and 38C, it won't pull the lever.

***Iron Lever.*** The lever protrudes from a vertical slot cut into the northwest wall. It rests in the up position. Pulling the lever down activates the trap in area 38C.

#### 38B. Access Tunnel
This hallway is 10 feet high and 5 feet wide. If the characters enter the hall through the crawlways from areas 30 or 37, read:

>>The walls of this narrow tunnel slope inward as they approach the ten-foot-high ceiling. Patches of mold cling to the walls and floor in the eastern half of the hall. Cut into the floor at the west end of the corridor is a three-foot-wide, four-foot-long rectangular hole with bright light spilling out of it.
>>

Any character standing next to the hole can peer down into a cylindrical room (area 38C), the curved floor of which is 15 feet below the hole.

The wall north of the hole acts as a one-way window, but it appears no different from the rest of the tunnel from this side. Creatures in area 38A can see into this tunnel, but creatures in the tunnel can't see into area 38A. Spells such as *detect magic* and *true seeing* do not reveal the window from this side.

#### 38C. Revolving Drum
The characters can enter this room through the rectangular hole in the ceiling (area 38B) or through a stone door in the south wall.

>>This room is shaped like a drum or cylinder lying on its side, with its south end tapering toward a small stone door. Carvings of demons decorate the stonework, with flickering flames in all their eyes.
>>

The flickering flames were created by *continual flame* spells, which fill the room with bright light.

When the lever in area 38A is pulled, three hidden locks seal the south door, a *wall of stone* spell blocks the rectangular hole in the ceiling (cutting off escape to area 38B), and the room begins revolving. When that happens, all creatures present should roll initiative.

Any creature that is not firmly attached to a wall, flying, or under the effect of a *gaseous form* spell or similar magic is knocked about the revolving room. The creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw at the start of each of its turns, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Revolving Room Effects

| d20 | Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1–6 | The demon faces exhale jets of a soporific gas that dissipates quickly. Each creature in the room that is not immune to the poisoned condition must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious. An unconscious creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. |
| 7–12 | The demon faces exhale jets of sparkling dust, which blind any creature in the room that does not succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. A creature's blindness lasts until it is cured with a *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic. |
| 13–18 | Stone spikes 6 inches long magically protrude from the walls. Any creature that takes damage from the room at the start of its turn takes an additional 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes. The spikes retract when the next room effect is triggered. |
| 19–20 | The demon faces spew jets of an incendiary gas that promptly ignites, filling the room with fire. Each creature in the room takes 45 (10d8) fire damage. |

While the room is revolving, an additional effect is triggered at the end of initiative count 10. Roll a d20 and consult the Revolving Room Effects table.

The room stops tumbling if the lever in area 38A is raised, or if the south door is opened or destroyed. The door's locks are hidden in the walls and can't be picked with thieves' tools, and it takes three separate *knock* spells to unlock them. The door can also be wrenched open with a successful DC 26 Strength (Athletics) check or attacked. It has AC 17; 50 hit points; and immunity to fire, piercing, poison, psychic, slashing, and thunder damage.

### 39. Golem Pit

>>A fifteen-foot-wide, fifteen-foot-deep pit dominates this chamber. At the bottom of the pit, an eight-foot-tall clay figure stands motionless beside a stone treasure chest. A silver key hangs from a cord around the figure's neck.
>>
>>Two nine-foot-tall stone statues stand atop plinths on either side of the pit. A third plinth against the south wall stands empty. One of the statues depicts a hooded and bearded male figure with his left hand held high, index finger pointed up. The other portrays an armored male knight with his gauntleted right hand extended, its palm facing inward toward the knight.
>>

An invisible wall of force (as created by the *wall of force* spell) covers the top of the pit, shielding the **clay golem** and the chest below. By manipulating the statues, characters can teleport the golem up to their level, or send one of their own into the pit.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Moa or Papazotl receive advice when entering this area:

- Thoughtful Moa warns that adamantine or magic weapons are needed to harm a clay golem.
- Bossy Papazotl insists that someone stand on the third plinth. ("It must be empty for a reason!")

#### God Statues
The two statues facing the pit represent Azuth (god of wizardry) and Torm (god of courage and self-sacrifice). Either can be identified with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) check. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of abjuration magic around each statue.

Any examination of the plinths reveals that each statue is set on a rotating, spring-loaded gear. If the statue of Azuth is rotated to the right, one creature inside the pit teleports onto the third plinth, forcing aside any other creature standing there. If multiple creatures are in the pit, randomly determine which creature is teleported. Rotating the statue of Torm to the right teleports anything on or above the third plinth into the pit. Even if nothing is there, a popping is heard as air rushes in to fill the empty space. When a statue that has been turned is released, it grinds back to its starting position.

The clay golem has orders to attack any creature that it sees and can reach. If the golem is destroyed, **Withers** uses his *manual of golems* in area 28 to create a new one after 30 days.

#### Stone Chest
The chest and its hinges are made of stone. The chest weighs 250 pounds and is fitted with a silver locking mechanism. Opening the lock requires the silver key that the golem wears around its neck. A *mage hand* spell or similar magic can lift the key from around the golem's neck without causing the golem to attack. A character using thieves' tools can pick the lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. However, opening the chest by any means other than the silver key releases a cloud of gas that fills a 15-foot cube centered above the chest (filling the entire pit). The gas instantly corrodes and destroys all nonmagical metal that comes into contact with it, including armor and weapons. Metal objects sealed in containers are protected.

The chest is a Small object with AC 12, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

#### Treasure
The chest contains two 1-inch-diameter glass eyeballs resting on a red cushion. One eyeball is pale green and the other is pink.

***Crystal Eyes.*** The nonmagical crystal eyes are two of the ten keys needed to open the vault of the beholder (area 44).

### 40. Curse of the Golden Skull

>>A golden skull rests on a pedestal in the middle of this small, dusty room.
>>

This cursed human skull plated in gold is the remains of a fool named Yaka—an entertainer who once amused the royal family of Omu. If any character touches it, the skull levitates into the air and begins to follow that character everywhere. The skull never strays more than a few feet away, teleporting back to the character's side if it loses sight of him or her. As it hovers, Yaka's skull supplies a stream of deadpan banter in a mocking, hollow voice. Unless the skull is magically silenced, its inopportune comments cause the character to make all ability checks with disadvantage.

Roleplay the skull as cruel and cynical, with a dark sense of humor. It knows nothing of the tomb but pretends to know all. **Acererak** has warded the skull with powerful magic, rendering it impervious to damage and spells. Its curse is too powerful to be broken with any spell other than *wish*, which can be used either to destroy the skull or end the curse. If the curse ends but the skull survives, it teleports back to its pedestal and waits for another character to touch it.

The curse can also be ended by feeding gemstones to the skull, which it craves. The skull chews up and destroys any nonmagical gem fed to it, leaving no trace of the gem behind. Once it destroys 10,000 gp worth of gemstones, the skull teleports back to its pedestal and the curse ends for the affected character.

### 41. Tomb Guardians

>>Two hulking figures stand in alcoves along this long hall, facing each other. Armor is bolted to their flesh, and they wear bucket helms and spiked gauntlets. Iron collars around their necks are connected by a spiked chain that stretches across the corridor.
>>

The **tomb guardians** in the alcoves attack any creature that attacks them or tries to move past them. They are **flesh golems**, with these changes:

- The golems are clad in plate armor (AC 17).
- With its spiked gauntlets, a tomb guardian deals 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) piercing damage with each successful Slam attack.
- Each tomb guardian has a challenge rating of 6 (2,300 XP).

#### Spiked Chain
The magical spiked chain that binds the guardians together prevents them from moving more than 15 feet apart. Additionally, as long as the chain is intact, damage dealt to either guardian is divided evenly between them. The spiked chain can be attacked separately and has AC 18, a damage threshold of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the chain breaks, both tomb guardians instantly go berserk.

### 42. Kubazan's Tomb

>>A four-columned portico juts out from the far wall, beneath which a stone sarcophagus rests in a wall recess. Four ceramic frog masks hang in niches around the sarcophagus. Beneath the masks, humanoid bones are strewn across the floor. To the east, a large carving of a tentacled frog-monster squats above a shrine. Offerings lie on a shelf before it. Four rectangular frescoes adorn the adjacent walls.
>>

To unlock sarcophagus, the characters must perform a simple ritual at the shrine while wearing the frog masks. The wall frescoes reveal what must be done.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Nangnang, Obo'laka, or Shagambi receive advice when entering this area:

- Greedy Nangnang urges her host to snatch up the gold coins on the wall shrine.
- Cautious Obo'laka warns against trying on the masks.
- Wise Shagambi is convinced that the frescoes are clues to understanding the power of the wall shrine.

#### Frescoes
Four frescoes line the east wall of the tomb, two on each side of the shrine.

***Fresco 1.*** This fresco shows a time when Kubazan used his tentacles to help the Omuans cast down a statue of the god Ubtao:

>>A frog-like behemoth uses its tentacles to help the Omuan people knock down a mighty statue. In the foreground, an old woman wearing a frog mask tosses five coins from her hand as though sowing seeds.
>>

***Fresco 2.*** This fresco shows a time when Kubazan helped a group of Omuan hunters kill a giant crocodile that was threatening the city:

>>A frog-like behemoth wraps its tentacles around a giant crocodile as Omuan hunters stab the crocodile with their spears. In the foreground, an old man wearing a frog mask holds a bug up to his open mouth.
>>

***Fresco 3.*** This fresco shows a time when Kubazan helped the Omuans find a missing child in the jungle:

>>A frog-like behemoth with four Omuan hunters riding on its back finds a small boy in the jungle. The hunters seem elated. In the foreground, a young woman wearing a frog mask holds a knife in one hand and a headless chicken in the other.
>>

***Fresco 4.*** This fresco shows a time when Kubazan got angry and the Omuans appeased him with treasure:

>>A frog-like behemoth wallows in a shallow pool as Omuans offer it urns of food and treasure as tribute. Cracks in the fresco obscure the head of the human figure in the foreground, but you can see that it grasps a lit candle.
>>

A search of the wall shrine reveals several items:

- A 6-inch-tall stone statuette of a froghemoth (see *appendix D*), which weighs 5 pounds and has an inscription on its base in Old Omuan: "Give thanks to me as others have done since the dawn of time."
- A copper bowl containing rat bones
- Four dead cockroaches
- A green wax candle with a salvageable wick
- 5 gp (loose)

#### Performing the Ritual
To open the sarcophagus, one or more characters must stand before the wall shrine and perform the following actions in no particular order:

- Donate at least 5 gp to the shrine while wearing a frog mask.
- Light a candle before the shrine while wearing a frog mask.
- Spill the blood of a living creature into the copper bowl while wearing a frog mask.
- Eat a bug (living or dead) while wearing a frog mask.

If any of these actions are performed incorrectly, three **wraiths** rise from the bones on the floor. The wraiths attack until they are destroyed and pursue any characters who flee this area. When the wraiths appear, any character wearing one of the frog masks is polymorphed into a **frog**, as though it had failed a saving throw against the *polymorph spell*.

#### Sarcophagus
Kubazan's sarcophagus is bereft of adornment, though a *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals auras of abjuration and evocation magic around it.

When the ritual is performed correctly, the sarcophagus lid unlocks and slides open. It contains the bones of a froghemoth (Kubazan's animal form; see *appendix D*) as well as some valuable items (see "Treasure" below). The sarcophagus lid is otherwise sealed shut with an *arcane lock* spell. It can be opened with a *knock* spell or forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. However, if the sarcophagus is opened by any means other than the ritual, a *prismatic spray* spell (save DC 19) erupts from the wall behind the sarcophagus. All creatures in the room, as well as creatures in the narrow hallway to the south, become targets of the spell.

#### Treasure
The sarcophagus contains a pair of *bracers of archery* and twenty brittle arrows in a rotting leather quiver. Each arrow shatters on impact and deals only 1 piercing damage on a hit. Carvings of froghemoths adorn the bracers, which keep the skin of any character attuned to them disturbingly moist. The bracers turn to dust and are destroyed if they leave the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see "Lost Treasures").

***Kubazan's Spirit.*** The spirit of Kubazan tries to inhabit any character who touches either of the bracers (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods"). When Kubazan's spirit manifests, read:

>>The bracers glow as watery light ripples across the walls. A monstrous, tentacled shadow rises from the sarcophagus, and the air fills with the stench of a swamp. A rumbling voice echoes through the tomb: "You are brave to summon me. Together, we will crush the undying one!"
>>

If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Kubazan's card (see *appendix F*). If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the bracers and waits for another character to touch one of them.

### 43. Veils of Fear
This room lies beyond a double door, the outside of which is carved with leering and laughing skulls. The doors are neither locked nor trapped, and they swing inward on rusty hinges to reveal the room beyond.

>>Ten feet from the doors, a thick tapestry curtain hangs from wall to wall. Its embroidery shows a scene of merriment: nobles feasting around a banquet table, a roast boar on a platter, and servants pouring wine.
>>

Two more curtains hang beyond the first, each showing the same image descending into horror. When the second curtain is revealed, read:

>>Another curtain hangs behind the first, showing the same scene but descended into depravity. The nobles fight with each other, partake in carnal encounters on the table, or sprawl on the floor in puddles of vomit.
>>

Behind the second curtain is a third:

>>A scene of horror confronts you: nobles feasting on servants, eating each other alive, and setting fire to the hall. The roast boar is alive and laughing on its platter.
>>

A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of enchantment magic radiating from the third curtain. Any creature that looks at this curtain must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of it. A frightened creature tries to leave the room as quickly as possible and cannot reenter. Once outside the room, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that saves against this effect is unaffected by the curtain thereafter and can reenter the room.

#### Lord of the Feast
When the final tapestry curtain is pulled aside, the dreaded Lord of the Feast confronts the characters:

>>The rotting head of a giant boar is mounted to the wall behind the final curtain. Fresh blood and gore spatters its tusks, dribbling down the wall beneath it.
>>

Any humanoid that can see the severed boar's head must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by it. On its turn, a charmed creature does nothing except approach the severed head and put its own head in the boar's mouth. Only one head can fit in the mouth at a time. If the boar's mouth is already full, a charmed creature waits patiently until the mouth is clear. Any creature that ends its turn with its head in the boar's mouth takes 22 (4d10) slashing damage as the boar's jaws clamp down. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it cannot be affected by the boar's head for 24 hours.

Destroying the Lord of the Feast ends its charm effect on all creatures. The boar's head is a Medium object with AC 5 and 22 hit points.

#### Treasure
Destroying the boar's head reveals three items lodged between its teeth: a bent pair of gold spectacles (25 gp), a leather eye patch set with a bloodstone (50 gp), and a platinum hair pin (75 gp).

### 44. Vault of the Beholder
An invisible beholder lairs in this circular chamber. To enter, adventurers must pass through a locked door.

#### 44A. Eyes of the Beholder

>>The corridor ends in a large door with a round mirror set into its surface. Ten circular indentations, each about an inch across, surround the mirror.
>>

The door is sealed tight and can't be opened with ability checks or magic. To open the door, ten crystal eyes found elsewhere in the dungeon (see areas 31A, 32, 33, 35B, 37, and 39) must be inserted into the indentations. Each eye lights up as it clicks into place. With each eye that is inserted, the reflections of the characters in the mirror become progressively unhealthier—losing weight, hair, and teeth as they come to resemble undead.

When all ten eyes are in place, they disappear and the door grinds open and remains open henceforth.

#### 44B. Inside the Vault
When the door opens, read:

>>The vault door grinds upward, revealing a domed, candlelit room fifty feet high. The polished marble floor is so perfectly reflective that it creates the illusion of standing at the entrance to a sphere. Nine alcoves filled with glittering treasure open up along the walls. In the middle of the chamber, a large spherical object hovers under a black silk drape twenty feet above the floor.
>>

The **beholder**, Belchorzh (pronounced BEL-korj), floats at the top of the room. **Acererak** cast a *wish* spell to render Belchorzh invisible. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 19) cast on the beholder or contact with an *antimagic field* ends its invisibility. Belchorzh reacts to intruders as described in the "Beholder Tactics" section below.

The hall contains one hundred lit candles. While the candles remain inside this vault, they burn indefinitely. If a candle is taken from the room, it burns down normally.

The floor beneath the dome is magically slick. Any creature that steps onto or starts its turn on the floor must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. When an untethered creature is shoved or otherwise moved across the floor, it travels in one direction and does not stop until it comes into contact with a wall or other barrier.

The alcoves contain treasure (see "Treasure" below).

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Kubazan, Obo'laka, or Wongo receive the following advice:

- Impulsive Kubazan urges his host to attack whatever is hiding under the black drape, with no warning or negotiation.
- Cautious Obo'laka thinks a beholder is hidden under the black drape and urges her host to flee at once.
- When he becomes aware of the beholder, reckless Wongo suggests that his host attack another party member, to trick the beholder into thinking it has an ally.

#### Black Drape, Iron Sphere
The black drape conceals a magical sphere of iron, 6 feet in diameter and floating 20 feet above the floor. A *Nystul's magic aura* spell placed on the sphere makes it seem like an evil aberration to features or magic that can sense such information.

The iron sphere is hollow and immobile, and it remains inert while the drape covers it. Belchorzh can use its telekinetic eye ray to remove the drape at any time, revealing the sphere and causing it to emit a magical magnetic field. Each creature in the room wearing metal armor is pulled to the sphere and becomes stuck to it, as does any metal weapon or object that isn't secured or being held. Any creature stuck to the sphere is restrained until the magnetic field deactivates.

Any ranged attack made in the chamber that uses ammunition made wholly or partly from metal has disadvantage on the attack roll; if the attack misses, the ammunition becomes stuck to the sphere.

Throwing the black drape over the sphere renders it temporarily inert, with creatures and objects stuck to it falling to the floor. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 16) cast on the sphere dispels the *Nystul's magic aura* spell, permanently deactivates the magnetic field, and causes the sphere to crash to the floor. This sends a web of cracks through the marble, negating the floor's frictionless effect and allowing creatures to move across it normally. The sphere also deactivates and falls if it comes into contact with an *antimagic field* or is destroyed.

The sphere is a Large object with AC 20; 100 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It weighs 1,000 pounds. While the magnetic field is active, any attack made against the sphere with a metal weapon automatically hits, though the weapon becomes stuck to the sphere after impact.

#### Beholder Tactics
The Tomb of the Nine Gods is not truly the beholder's domain, so it can't use lair actions.

The invisible beholder puts as much distance between itself and the adventurers as possible, while making sure to not catch the iron sphere in its Antimagic Cone.

Belchorzh doesn't pursue intruders who flee its vault. However, if the adventurers steal even one copper piece from its trove, the beholder uses the alien growth throughout this level of the dungeon against them. Whenever the characters come near a patch of the growth, it sprouts an eyestalk and attacks (see "Alien Growth").

The beholder knows Deep Speech and Undercommon, and it refers to itself in the third person. Haughty and defiant, it delights in the destruction of tomb robbers while refusing to yield. Any character who understands its words can translate a few of Belchorzh's choice sayings:

- "You fight like flumphs!"
- "You are no match for Belchorzh the Unseen's terrible eye rays!"
- "What ugly, imperfect creatures you are."

#### Treasure
The nine alcoves contain the following treasures:

- 12,000 cp, 5,000 sp, and 2,200 gp
- A clay chameleon statuette covered in crystal beads that change colors (25 gp)
- Three painted gold masks sized for children and shaped like the faces of a bat, a monkey, and a parrot, respectively (75 gp each)
- A gold coronet shaped like an octopus with mother-of-pearl eyes (2,500 gp)
- A *potion of diminution*, a *bead of force*, and a bronze *+1 shield* shaped like a screaming devil's face

## Level 4: Chambers of Horror
Map 5.4 shows this level of the dungeon. These corridors and chambers are choked with dust, their floors littered with rubble and the bones of dead Omuans.

![[078-512a.webp|right|300]]
### 45. Gargoyle Guardians

>>At the bottom of the grand staircase, a resonant mechanical rumbling emanates from a dark shaft opening up in the middle of this chamber's floor. Four cylindrical stone pedestals surround the shaft, each ten feet tall, five feet wide, and featuring a tiny slot in its side. Squatting atop each pedestal is a large four-armed gargoyle.
>>

Any character looking down on the room from one of the balconies above or another high vantage point notices something else:

>>Each gargoyle is contained within a square made of metallic tiles embedded in the top of its pedestal. Starting with the northernmost pedestal and going clockwise, the tiles are copper, silver, gold, and platinum.
>>

![[079-511.webp|right|300]]

Four **giant four-armed gargoyles** (see *appendix D*) are perched atop the pedestals, each one crouched within its square of tiled precious metal. The gargoyles remain motionless until they are provoked.

The slots in each pedestal are 4 feet above the floor and roughly the size of a standard coin. All humanoids must pay a tithe before leaving this room to avoid provoking the gargoyles' wrath. Specifically, each humanoid must insert a coin of the appropriate type into each pedestal (1 cp in the north pedestal, 1 sp in the east pedestal, 1 gp in the south pedestal, and 1 pp in the west pedestal). A gargoyle will always accept a more precious coin than the one required, so a character inserting a platinum coin into every pedestal could exit the room safely. A gargoyle will also accept a tithe of multiple coins of equal or greater value (10 cp instead of 1 sp in the east pedestal, for example). The pedestals have hollow cavities within them to store the coins (see "Treasure" below).

The gargoyles always know when they're being cheated. If any humanoid leaves the room without offering sufficient coin, any cheated gargoyles spring to life and attack the cheapskate. A gargoyle also springs to life and attacks if it or its pedestal is damaged in any way. The metallic tiles atop the pedestals can be pried loose, but they turn to dust if removed from this chamber.

#### Shaft
The shaft in the floor is 10 feet wide and 15 feet deep. It opens into the ceiling of area 58. To scale the smooth walls of the shaft, a character needs climbing gear or magic.

#### Treasure
Each pedestal is a hollow stone cylinder with 6-inch-thick walls. Characters with appropriate tools can smash through the stone to get at the coins within each pedestal.

The north pedestal holds 5 sp and 100 cp. The east pedestal hides 1 gp, 120 sp, and 200 cp. The south pedestal conceals 2 pp, 90 gp, 350 sp, and 500 cp. The west pedestal holds 10 pp, 630 gp, 7,200 sp, 5,000 cp, and the skeletal remains of an Omuan engineer.

### 46. Lizard Den

>>A six-foot-tall green devil face is carved into the far end of this hallway, its mouth agape. Painted murals on the walls show faceless humanoid figures doubled over in pain, clutching at their heads and ears.
>>

Despite the ominous murals and the devil face carving, this hall is devoid of traps. Any character who searches the devil face finds a **lizard** hiding in the carving's shallow mouth cavity. The recipient of an *awaken* spell cast by a Chultan druid, the lizard has an Intelligence score of 10 and speaks Druidic. The Company of the Yellow Banner captured it in Omu and brought it to the tomb thinking it might be useful for setting off traps. The lizard escaped and wound up here. It doesn't know what became of its captors and helps the characters any way it can if they promise to return it to Omu.

### 47. Elemental Cells
To reach Shagambi's tomb (area 48), the adventurers must pass through four cells thematically linked to fire, water, air, and earth. Unless the characters destroyed him, **Withers** (see area 28) senses when the secret door to area 47A is opened and uses the scrying pool in area 25 to observe the adventurers as they contend with the cells.

An *antimagic field* fills each cell, rendering magic items useless, suppressing ongoing magical effects, and preventing all spellcasting. See the spell's description in the *Player's Handbook* for full information.

#### 47A. Fire Cell

>>Waves of heat blast out of this cramped cell. The walls are scribed with relief carvings showing volcanoes setting cities ablaze. Rows of tiny holes are bored into the floor and the ten-foot-high ceiling. A human skeleton embedded in the opposite wall holds an iron sconce with a burning red candle in it.
>>

The skeleton is all that remains of a dead Omuan engineer. As long as the candle remains in this cell, it burns indefinitely. If taken from the area, it burns down normally.

***Secret Door.*** If **Withers** is watching, he tries to trap as many characters as he can in the cell by whispering a command word that causes the secret door in the south wall to slide shut and lock. No keyhole or visible opening mechanism can be found on the secret door. The secret door remains sealed until the characters escape from the cells or die trying. A wedge, spike, or similar object can be used to prevent the door from closing.

***Lava Trap.*** Molten lava begins pouring from the tiny holes in the ceiling as soon as any character comes within 1 foot of the candle or removes it from the sconce. The lava rains down and magically drains away through the holes in the floor. Each creature in the cell when the lava begins to fall must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that enters the cell for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must repeat the saving throw. Because of the cell's *antimagic field*, magic items and spells that provide resistance to fire offer no protection here.

***Extinguishing the Candle.*** If the candle is extinguished inside the cell, the *antimagic field* is dispelled and all creatures in the cell are teleported to one of the other cells, as follows:

- If the candle's flame is doused with water or some other liquid, creatures in the cell are teleported to the water cell (area 47B).
- If the candle's flame is blown out or smothered by a lack of oxygen (including being ground out against the wall or floor), creatures are teleported to the air cell (area 47C).

#### 47B. Water Cell

>>You appear in a cell that smells moldy. Its damp walls are covered with living snails and oysters, and feature sculptural reliefs of tidal waves destroying coastal cities and ships. A merfolk skeleton embedded in one wall clutches an iron sconce fitted with a burning red candle. Suddenly, lukewarm water begins to pour into the cell through rows of tiny holes in the ten-foot-high ceiling.
>>

The candle is a distraction and offers no way out of the cell. As long as it remains in this cell, the candle burns indefinitely until extinguished. If taken from the area, it burns down normally.

***Flood Trap.*** The water fills the cell at a rate of 1 foot per round, taking 10 rounds to fill the room. If the candle is left in its sconce, the rising water extinguishes it on the fourth round. Trying to stuff or block the holes doesn't stop the water from pouring in. Because of the cell's *antimagic field*, spells and magic items that enable characters to breathe underwater don't function here. Any character who runs out of air begins to suffocate (see "*The Environment*" in chapter 8 of the *Player's Handbook*).

***Snails and Oysters.*** There are dozens of snails and oysters clinging to the walls. A character can use an action to remove an oyster or snail from a wall, crack it open, and eat it. The first time an oyster or snail is removed from a wall, the cell's *antimagic field* is dispelled. Eating an oyster teleports a character (along with his or her possessions) to the air cell (area 47C), while eating a snail teleports a character (along with his or her possessions) to the earth cell (area 47D).

When the last character leaves the cell, rows of tiny holes open in the floor, allowing the water to drain out at a rate of 1 foot per round.

#### 47C. Air Cell

>>You immediately begin to choke as you are teleported to a room with no light, no sound, and no air.
>>

The cell's *antimagic field* douses magical lights, and nonmagical flames are snuffed out because of the lack of oxygen in the room. Creatures that can see in the dark can see the following:

>>Sculptural reliefs on the walls of this dark cell show tornadoes uprooting trees and tearing cities apart. An aarakocra skeleton embedded in one wall holds an iron sconce bearing an unlit red candle.
>>

Any creature that requires air to breathe immediately begins to suffocate unless it took the precaution of holding its breath before teleporting here (see "*The Environment*" in chapter 8 of the *Player's Handbook*).

Any character who cannot see can use an action to blindly search the cell by touch, then make a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the check succeeds, the character discerns one key feature of the room: either the wall carvings, the aarakocra skeleton, or the candle.

***Aarakocra Bones.*** The aarakocra skeleton embedded in the wall has hollow bones containing stale yet breathable air—each one essentially a tube sealed with wax. A character with a dagger or similar tool can use an action to pry a bone out of the wall, pierce the wax seal, and inhale the air within. The first time a bone is removed from a wall, the cell's *antimagic field* is dispelled. Any character who inhales the air is teleported (along with his or her possessions) to area 48.

***Unlit Candle.*** The candle can't be lit without air, but let characters waste time trying. The candle is not the means by which characters can escape the cell. If somehow lit, the candle burns indefinitely as long as it remains in this cell. If taken from the area, it burns down normally.

#### 47D. Earth Cell

>>The walls of this stone cell are covered with reliefs showing desert sands swallowing the ruins of civilization. A bas-relief of a robed medusa dominates one wall. It wears a stone necklace with an obsidian pendant and clutches an iron sconce with a burning red candle in it. Sand begins to fall from tiny holes bored into the ten-foot-high ceiling, and you hear a rumbling noise under the floor.
>>

The candle can be extinguished and relit, but is of no use to characters trying to escape the room. As long as it remains in this cell, the candle burns indefinitely. If taken from the area, it burns down normally.

Any character who searches the cell and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a seam running down the middle of the floor from north to south. The seam suggests the existence of a pit trap.

***Trap.*** The falling sand fills the room at a rate of 6 inches per round, turning the floor into difficult terrain after 1 round. Any character who can reach the ceiling can use an action to stuff a number of holes with cloth or wax, slowing the sand by 1 inch per round. If the sand reaches a depth of 12 inches, the floor splits open along its seam. When the pit opens, half of the floor swings down to the west and the other half drops to the east, and the sand stops falling. A 6-inch-wide ledge surrounds the pit on all sides. Any creature standing on the floor when it opens must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw; those standing along the walls have advantage on the save. On a successful save, a creature finds purchase on the ledge. A creature that fails the save falls.

The 10-foot-deep pit contains two giant stone rollers with interlocking stone teeth. Anything larger than a grain of sand gets chewed up between these rollers, taking 132 (24d10) force damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is ground to a pulp. A creature that passes through the rollers with at least 1 hit point remaining lands on an iron grate 5 feet below the grinders. A stone button is set into one of the walls above the grate and is visible only to creatures under the rollers. When pressed, the button causes the rollers to stop turning and retract into the walls, allowing creatures that survived the horrid trap to climb out with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

The pit is within the cell's *antimagic field*, so spells and magical effects that might otherwise allow a character to survive the rollers or ascend the pit won't work.

***Secret Door.*** Any character who searches the medusa bas-relief and succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check notices seams around the carving, suggesting the presence of a secret door. A successful check also reveals that the medusa's obsidian pendant is a button. The button won't depress unless the pit is open. A character can try to unlock the button using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check. Pressing the unlocked pendant causes the secret door's lock to release with a dull clunk, after which the door can be swung open to reveal area 48 beyond. The secret door has springs that cause it to close automatically unless it is held or wedged open. The door locks when it closes and can be opened only from within the cell.

### 48. Shagambi's Tomb
Each character who teleports into this tomb from area 47C appears atop a randomly determined teleportation rune (see "Teleportation Runes" below). Characters can also enter the tomb through the secret door at area 47D.

>>This tomb is filled with **terracotta warriors**, kneeling in neat ranks around a polished wooden coffin. Between the warriors, four aisles scattered with broken pottery lead up to the coffin, whose painted lid shows a leopard with serpents sprouting from its shoulders.
>>

If intruders are heard within the tomb, the terracotta warriors rise to defend it (see "Terracotta Warriors" below). To steal Shagambi's treasures, characters must move quietly.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Unkh or Wongo receive advice when entering this area:

- Nervous Unkh suggests that her host leave the tomb at once using one of the teleportation runes, though she can't decide which rune is best.
- Impulsive Wongo thinks it's a good idea to shatter as many terracotta warriors as possible, as quickly as possible.

#### Teleportation Runes
Three teleportation runes are scribed on the floor along the north, east, and south walls of the tomb. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals that each rune has a different aura—strong, steady conjuration magic from the eastern rune; flickering conjuration magic from the northern rune; and a combination of conjuration and transmutation magic from the southern rune.

Whenever a creature teleports into the tomb, roll a d6 to determine which rune it arrives on: 1–2, north rune; 3–4, east rune; 5–6, south rune. If more than one creature is teleported to the same rune, the previous creature is pushed harmlessly off the rune when the new creature appears. Additionally, the north rune is malfunctioning, and any creature arriving there takes 18 (4d8) force damage.

Any creature that moves from outside a rune into its space is instantly teleported to area 50. A creature that uses the south rune to teleport is also polymorphed into a random beast, as though it had failed its saving throw against the *polymorph* spell. Roll a d4 to determine the new form: 1, **baboon**; 2, **bat**; 3, **flying snake**; 4, **quipper**.

#### Terracotta Warriors
Forty-eight **terracotta warriors** guard the tomb. Use **animated armor** statistics, with these changes:

- Each **terracotta warrior** wields a shortsword. As an action, it can attack twice with the weapon (+4 to hit), dealing 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage on a hit.
- If a critical hit is scored against a **terracotta warrior**, it shatters and is destroyed.

The terracotta warriors remain perfectly still and pose no threat as long as the tomb remains relatively quiet. If any character talks loudly, steps on a piece of broken pottery, or makes any other equivalent noise while in the tomb, read:

>>All the terracotta warriors turn their heads to face you. As one, they pull their swords a few inches from their scabbards.
>>

After this single warning, the **terracotta warriors** attack if they hear any other noise. Without the use of magic, any creature walking through the tomb must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check to remain quiet. Moving through pottery shards imposes disadvantage on the check. Once roused into action, the terracotta warriors attack all the creatures in the tomb.

#### Coffin
Shagambi's coffin is trapped but not locked. When its lid is opened, a music box inside the coffin is activated, rousing the terracotta warriors if they can hear its haunting melody (even if the adventurers have been silent up to that point). Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check while gently lifting the coffin lid spots the trap's trigger wire, which can then be cut with thieves' tools and a successful DC 12 Dexterity check. The music box is activated on a failed check.

The bones of a kamadan (Shagambi's animal form; see *appendix D*) are bound in cloth inside the sarcophagus, along with valuables (see "Treasure" below).

#### Treasure
The following treasures are heaped around Shagambi's bones: 200 gp, five moonstones (50 gp each), the fine music box activated by the trap (250 gp), and an *instrument of the bards* (Canaith mandolin). The instrument turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see "Lost Treasures").

***Shagambi's Spirit.*** The spirit of Shagambi tries to inhabit any character who touches the mandolin (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods"). When Shagambi's spirit manifests, read:

>>Six shadowy serpents slither out of the mandolin and coil around your body. You hear a purring voice in your mind say, "I am not your enemy."
>>

If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Shagambi's card (see *appendix F*). If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the mandolin and waits for another character to touch it.

### 49. Maze of Death
Stone slabs seal off the entrances to this corner of the dungeon.

#### 49A. Stone Slabs
When the characters reach either entrance, read:

>>A stone slab blocks the end of this corridor. Painted on the slab is the image of a gaunt male humanoid wearing a hooded cloak, its face a mask of stars. The figure's withered left hand is raised with palm extended.
>>

The stone slabs are impervious to damage and spells, and they are fitted so snugly that even creatures in gaseous form can't slip past them. If any character stands in front of a slab and raises his or her left hand with palm extended, both slabs open at the same time, regardless of any efforts taken to prevent them from doing so. When this happens, read:

>>The slab sinks into the floor, revealing a dusty passageway beyond. Relief carvings on the walls depict crowds of humanoids fleeing a black star in the sky, with rays of light extending from it to turn those they strike to dust.
>>

If the stone slabs are raised up to seal off the exits once more (see area 49C), characters within the maze see a second image on the inner surface of each slab:

>>Painted on the inside of the slab is a male humanoid wearing a hooded cloak, once again with stars where his face should be. The figure holds up his right arm, which is severed neatly at the elbow.
>>

This image is visible only while the slabs are in their raised positions. From inside the maze, a character can make both slabs sink back down into the floor by standing in front of either slab while holding up his or her right arm—as long as that arm has been severed at the elbow. It doesn't matter how the arm is cut off, but sticking it in the *sphere of annihilation* in area 49B is one way to do it.

#### 49B. Green Devil Face

>>A green stone face of devilish countenance protrudes from the wall. The devil's mouth is agape and filled with darkness.
>>

The devil face is 6 feet tall, with a mouth 2 feet in diameter. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation magic on the face.

The darkness within the mouth is a *sphere of annihilation*, which can't be controlled or moved. Any character who stands within 5 feet of the sphere can hear a faint whisper emanating from it. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a character to make out words in Abyssal that translate as follows: "Darkness is coming for you. Your doom is at hand."

#### 49C. Black Opal Crown

>>In this central open space, a gold crown topped with a glittering black opal rests on a marble pedestal.
>>

If any creature removes the crown from the pedestal, two things happen simultaneously:

- The stone slabs in area 49A rise up to seal off both exits from the maze.
- Two **bodaks** (see *appendix D*) magically emerge from the *sphere of annihilation* in area 49B, seemingly unaffected by it, and begin scouring the maze for prey. Any creature killed by the bodaks is dragged back to the sphere and tossed into it. The bodaks crawl back into the sphere only if they're satisfied that there's nothing left in the maze to kill.

![[080-513.webp|right|300]]

***Treasure.*** The Black Opal Crown is worth 5,000 gp but can fetch up to four times that value if sold at auction in any major city. For more information on this item, see "Fabled Treasures."

### 50. Mirror of Life Trapping
Any creature teleported here from area 48 appears in a random spot near the center of the room and facing west, much to its peril.

>>This dusty room is fifteen feet square and empty except for an ornate, rectangular mirror mounted on the wall opposite the room's only exit.
>>

Attached to the west wall with *sovereign glue* is a *mirror of life trapping*. Any creature within 30 feet of the mirror that sees its reflection must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be imprisoned within one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. Constructs automatically succeed on the saving throw.

The mirror currently has three vacant cells. If the mirror traps a creature when its twelve cells are already occupied, it releases one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. The Prisoners of the Mirror table lists the mirror's current prisoners and summarizes how they react if set free or spoken to. Otherwise, roleplay them as you see fit.

The mirror has two command words. Speaking the word "Khomara" while standing within 5 feet of the mirror deactivates or reactivates it. (The mirror can't trap creatures while deactivated.) Speaking the word "Blackfire" along with a cell number frees the creature trapped in that cell.

Casting an *identify* spell on the mirror reveals its command words and magical properties. The command words are also written in the spellbook found in area 28.

#### Destroying the Mirror
If the mirror is destroyed, all creatures trapped within it are released at once. (See *chapter 7* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for the mirror's statistics.) Rather than running combat with so many creatures, assume that only the **invisible stalker** and the troll attack the party initially. The other creatures react to their liberation by turning on one another or running away, as follows:

- Lukanu and Zaal attack the gargoyle, destroying it in 4 rounds, and then help the characters deal with the **invisible stalker** and the troll.
- The stirge attacks A'tan, killing him in 1 round. After draining A'tan's blood, the stirge flies away to digest its meal.
- The doppelganger tries to flee but doesn't go far, hoping that the characters survive and returning to thank them if they prevail.
- Tlad Xolbrys uses his magic to help the characters unless it looks like they're near defeat, whereupon the drow turns against them.

#### Prisoners of the Mirror

| Cell | Prisoner | Notes | Reaction if Released |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | A'tan (CN male Chultan human **commoner**) | Omuan merchant trapped shortly after the fall of Omu; driven insane by his long incarceration | Follows his liberators around, talking nonsense |
| 2 | — | — | — |
| 3 | **Invisible stalker** | Mirror guardian | Tries to kill whoever released it, and vanishes if it succeeds |
| 4 | Zaal (**minotaur**) | Trapped by **Acererak** shortly after Omu's fall | Attacks any other creature it sees except Lukanu, whom it obeys |
| 5 | — | — | — |
| 6 | Yraggath (**troll**) | Driven insane by its captivity | Attacks anything it can eat |
| 7 | Tlad Xolbrys (NE male **drow mage**) | A visitor to Omu who was trapped during the construction of the Tomb of the Nine Gods | Aids or betrays his liberators to ensure his own survival |
| 8 | Pox (**doppelganger**) | Disguised as a male human adventurer named Biff Longsteel; followed the Company of the Yellow Banner into the tomb | Tries to join the party and stay out of harm's way |
| 9 | **Giant four-armed gargoyle** (see *appendix D*) | Mirror guardian | Attacks all other creatures, then stands guard next to the mirror |
| 10 | — | — | — |
| 11 | Lukanu (N female Chultan **champion**; see *appendix D*) | Bodyguard to Queen Napaka of Omu, trapped during the city's fall; wears *scorpion armor* (see *appendix C*) | Helps her liberators, but won't leave Omu until she learns what happened to Queen Napaka (see area 53) |
| 12 | **Stirge** | Trapped when it flew toward the mirror | Attacks the nearest warm-blooded creature |

### 51. Ghastly Door

>>What appears to be a large stone door looms at the end of the hallway, but it bears no handles or hinges. Jutting from the wall on either side of the door are two matching bronze sculptures—each the head and neck of a serpent with fangs bared. On the lintel above the door is inscribed the following message in Common: "Warm like flame, cold for the cruel, still for the dead, gruel for the ghoul."
>>

The stench of rotting flesh wafts from the bronze serpents. Close examination reveals dried blood in each statue's mouth and tiny tubes at the back of its neck. The tubes extend into secret rooms on either side of the door, where six **ghasts** are confined (three per room).

The stone door opens when a pint or more of fresh blood is poured into the mouth of each bronze serpent. The blood drips into the chambers holding the ghasts, driving them into a slurping frenzy that can be heard through the serpents' open mouths. Once sated with blood, the ghasts yank chains to hoist the door open.

The door weighs 1,000 pounds and can be lifted by characters with a combined Strength of 33 or more. If the characters do so, secret doors on either side of the hallway behind the door unlock and slide open. This releases the hungry ghasts, which fight until turned or destroyed. Each locked secret door can be opened with a *knock* spell or forced open by a character who succeeds on a DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check.

### 52. Throne Room

>>This vaulted chamber features a ten-foot-deep sunken floor surrounded by ledges without railings. Alcoves along the ledges hold painted wooden statues of hornet-headed humanoid warriors, each wearing a grass skirt and clutching a spear.
>>
>>A gruesome throne lashed together of bone and strips of skin stands atop the west ledge. A fearsome horned skull surmounts the throne, and small skulls are piled around it. The seat of the throne appears to be made of stretched skin and has a metal scepter resting on it.
>>
>>Shuffling about the sunken portion of the room are three gaunt humanoid figures in dusty robes draped in cobwebs, their eyes and mouths stitched shut. Armed with brushes and clay pots of pigment, they paint the walls and pillars with grim, poorly rendered illustrations.
>>

Four pillars support the ceiling, which is 15 feet above the ledges and 25 feet above the sunken floor. The wooden statues are harmless (their spears are merely decorative) and weigh 150 pounds each.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Obo'laka or Papazotl receive advice when entering this area:

- Cautious Obo'laka advises her host to not disturb the throne or pick up the scepter, but admits not knowing for certain that either is harmful.
- Shrewd Papazotl realizes that the throne is made from the bones of dead Omuans and the skull of Omu's great minotaur champion, Karagos.

#### Blind Artists
![[081-514.webp|right|300]]

The three creatures skulking about the room are undead servants of **Acererak**. Despite their blindness, each has the magical ability to perceive and paint scenes of pain, carnage, and death that have occurred in the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

One of the artists is presently painting over scenes depicting the fall of the Company of the Yellow Banner. All that remains is an image of a human male (the late Lord Brixton, whose remains can be found in area 63) choking on poisonous gas. The other two artists are in the process of painting images that capture the player characters' harrowing exploits in the tomb thus far. (Choose memorable moments in which one or more party members were badly wounded or killed.)

The undead artists have the statistics of **zombies**, with these changes:

- Instead of darkvision, each artist has blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. The artists are blind beyond this radius and immune to the blinded condition.
- They have no effective attacks and are worth 0 XP.

If the characters turn or destroy any of the artists, a **tyrannosaurus zombie** (see *appendix D*) bursts up from a cavity beneath the floor and attacks, leaving a 20-foot diameter hole and shattered floor tiles behind. While it's too big to squeeze down any 5-foot-wide corridors, it can easily traverse the wider passageway to the east.

#### Throne of Acererak
The throne is made from the skin and bones of slain Omuan warriors, and the skulls of Omuan children are piled around it. The skull atop the throne once belonged to a minotaur guardian of Omu named Karagos. Any creature that touches the skull or sits in the throne must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become cursed with the Rage of Karagos. When cursed, the creature gains 50 temporary hit points and goes berserk. Until the curse is lifted, the victim is forced to attack the nearest creature it can see with melee attacks. It can't make ranged attacks or cast spells, and if it can't see any creatures to attack, it does nothing. The curse ends if the berserk creature drops to 0 hit points, or if a *greater restoration* or *remove curse* spell is cast on it. When the curse ends, the temporary hit points granted by it disappear.

***Acererak's Scepter.*** The scepter on the throne is made of solid iron and has an adamantine head. It is nonmagical, weighs 12 pounds, and can be wielded as a mace. Its magical twin is hidden in area 53.

#### Secret Doors
Behind the statue in the northwest alcove, a secret door leads to area 53. The door is slightly ajar, and any character who searches the alcove finds it.

A properly closed secret door in the southeast corner of the room leads to a spiral staircase going up and down (area 26).

### 53. Crypt of the Sun Queen

>>The walls of this room are adorned with tile mosaics of a jungle city intermingled with frescoes of flowering plants, birds, insects, and humans wearing gold skirts and carrying spears and ornate jugs. The ceiling is painted to look like a clear blue sky. A small bejeweled cockroach rests atop a sarcophagus of black basalt in the middle of the room. A two-foot-diameter orb hanging from a chain above the sarcophagus is made of hammered gold to resemble a smiling sun.
>>

After **Acererak** slew the trickster gods of Omu and enslaved the city, Napaka, the city's elderly queen, chose not to flee, and instead offered herself as a sacrifice in exchange for the release of her people. **Acererak** was impressed by the queen's courage—not enough to spare her life or honor her request, but enough to place her in a special crypt.

A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals auras of evocation magic around the golden sun and the bejeweled cockroach (see "Treasure" below).

The lid of the black sarcophagus bears a name etched in Common: NAPAKA. The lid is sealed with strips of melted lead that can be easily pried away. Once the lead is removed, the lid can be pushed aside with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The interior of the sarcophagus is lined with lead and contains several treasures (see "Treasure" below).

#### Golden Sun
Whenever the sun or its chain are touched or damaged, the sun's smile fades to an inscrutable expression, and it emits tremendous heat in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. This effect ends if all creatures leave the affected area.

The first time the queen's remains or any of her treasures are removed from the sarcophagus, the sun's expression turns angry as it emits rays of searing light. Each creature within 30 feet of the sun that doesn't have total cover against it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a ray, which deals 42 (12d6) fire damage.

The sun and its chain are treated as a single Small object with AC 15; 22 hit points; and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. The sun loses its magical properties when it shoots its rays or is destroyed.

#### Treasure
The jewelry box and the sarcophagus contain treasure.

***Jewelry Box.*** The cockroach-shaped jewelry box is made of gold, set with precious gems (including tiny black pearls for its eyes), and worth 1,500 gp. It weighs 5 pounds and contains two items: a small jade key shaped like a crocodile (designed to fit in the keyhole in area 62B) and a *necklace of fireballs* with eight beads remaining. **Acererak** placed a curse on the necklace, which can be revealed by an *identify* spell.

When any creature dons the cursed necklace, all its beads detonate at once. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the exploding necklace must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The wearer of the necklace fails the saving throw automatically. A *remove curse* spell or similar magic removes the curse from the necklace.

***Sarcophagus.*** The sarcophagus contains the magically preserved remains of Queen Napaka. She wears the tattered remnants of a black gown and a hornet mask made of painted gold (250 gp).

In her left hand, Napaka holds an iron scepter with an adamantine head, which is lighter than it appears (5 pounds). A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the scepter, which can be used to destroy the stone juggernaut in area 62. Casting an *identify*, *legend lore*, or similar spell on the scepter reveals that its singular purpose is to destroy a construct named after Napaka.

If the scepter is removed and not immediately replaced with its nonmagical twin from area 52, or if Napaka's remains are removed from their resting place, the queen's corpse opens its mouth in a wide yawn and exhales a baleful black gas that fills a 15-foot cube centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (7d12) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Questioning Napaka
Queen Napaka has been dead for more than a century. If a *speak with dead* spell is cast on her corpse, the characters can ask it questions about Omu and receive honest answers. Napaka came to believe that the gods of Omu were not truly divine beings but rather trickster spirits that had fooled the Omuan people into worshiping them. The queen remembers **Acererak** killing the trickster gods and enslaving the Omuans, but she knows nothing about the Tomb of the Nine Gods, which was built after her death. She knows that a few members of the royal family fled Omu, but she is unaware that the aarakocra are sheltering her great-grandchildren at Kir Sabal. Napaka knows that her grandmother, Zalkoré, languishes in the ruins of Nangalore.

Even in death, Napaka pines for Omu to be reborn and repopulated. However, what she desires above all is the destruction of **Acererak**.

### 54. Rolling Doom

>>After ten feet, this dusty corridor becomes a staircase that descends fifteen feet to a lower tunnel. Resting on the floor at the bottom of the staircase is an old treasure chest with a rusty built-in lock. Just beyond the chest, the tunnel opens up to a huge, dark chamber.
>>

The chest (area 54A) is the trigger for a trap. When the chest or its lid is lifted, a heavy stone ball (area 54B) tumbles down the stairs. Adventurers fleeing the stone ball stumble into a hidden pit (area 54C).

#### 54A. Treasure Chest
The lock on the chest can be picked with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools. Within the chest is an invisible key, 3 inches long and made of brass. Any character who manually searches inside the chest feels the key, which unlocks the clock in area 56.

If the chest is smashed by the granite ball (see below), the invisible key is lost in the wreckage but can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

A *detect magic* spell or similar effect also reveals the presence of the key, either in the chest or among the wreckage. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 14) cast on the key renders it visible.

#### 54B. Granite Ball
A 5-foot-diameter sphere of solid granite balances within a secret compartment at the top of the stairs. Finding the compartment requires that a character search the tunnel ceiling and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The hatch can be jammed with an iron spike or with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools.

When released, the stone ball thunders down the stairs and tumbles into the pit at 54C. Any character on the stairs or in the tunnel below can stay ahead of the ball by running toward the pit. A character can also leap over the ball with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Any character who fails the check or can't move out of the ball's way is struck for 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and knocked prone. The ball also flattens the treasure chest (54A) as it tumbles through.

#### 54C. Acid Pit
The walls of this 10-foot-deep pit are lined with thick glass, and the pit is filled with green acid to a depth of 5 feet. The pit's lid is crafted of interlocking stone tiles that fall apart beneath 100 pounds or more of weight. Any character who searches the floor notices the unusual stonework and smells the acid below with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check.

A creature in the area of the pit when the floor collapses can avoid a fall and grab the edge of the pit with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The saving throw is made with disadvantage if the character was unaware of the pit. Any creature that enters the acid for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 66 (12d10) acid damage. The walls of the pit are too smooth to climb without the aid of magic or climbing gear.

The pit's acid can be safely contained in glass vials if the characters have any at hand, and can then be used as the acid in chapter 5, "Equipment," of the *Player's Handbook*.

### 55. Unkh's Tomb

>>Four marble columns support the ceiling of this grand tomb. Twin staircases ascend to an upper gallery, where a carving in the form of a giant maze adorns the wall. On the floor of the tomb stands an opaque crystal sarcophagus that is constantly changing color. Minotaur murals adorn the walls on the lower level of the tomb.
>>

The walls of the tomb are lined with secret doors that slide open to reveal chambers strewn with minotaur bones—ten chambers in all. One of these chambers has a hallway at the back of it leading to area 56.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of I'jin or Kubazan receive advice when entering this area:

- Fickle I'jin suggests waiting for the sarcophagus to turn gold before trying to open it. (Gold is I'jin's favorite color.)
- Brave Kubazan urges his host to inspect the maze carving and be the first one to touch it.

#### Maze
When the wall carving is examined, read:

>>The intricate carving shifts before your eyes, its configuration ever-changing. The maze has no exits, and its corridors are lit by tiny torches and clouded by fog.
>>

Any non-undead creature that touches the wall carving vanishes and reappears in a demiplanar maze, the configuration of which matches that of the carving. The first time this happens, all the secret doors slide open as the minotaur bones knit together, forming ten **minotaur skeletons** that emerge from their chambers and attack anyone in the tomb. All creatures present should roll initiative, including anyone trapped in the maze. The keys to open Unkh's sarcophagus are hidden in the maze.

When a character arrives in the maze, describe it as follows:

>>You stand within a fifteen-foot-high passageway walled by smooth, featureless stone, which is lit by torches and shrouded by fog. There's no ceiling, and when you look up, you see a distorted view of the room you left behind.
>>

Characters standing near the wall carving can see characters trapped in the maze but can't hear them. Similarly, characters in the maze can see giant, distorted versions of any creatures standing within 10 feet of the wall carving, but they can't hear anything outside the maze.

The configuration of the maze constantly changes to ensure that characters within it remain separated and unable to find each other. Visibility within the maze is limited to 20 feet because of the churning fog. Spells that are altered within the tomb are similarly altered in the maze (see "Spell Restrictions").

The walls of the maze can be climbed with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Any character who climbs to the top of the walls or flies beyond them is expelled from the maze, taking 22 (5d8) force damage and reappearing with a loud pop in an unoccupied space near the wall carving.

***Finding a Key.*** Any character in the maze can spend time exploring it. At the end of each turn spent exploring the maze, roll percentile dice and use the Maze Discoveries table to determine what, if anything, the character finds. Any character who finds a crystal key and picks it up is teleported to an unoccupied space next to Unkh's sarcophagus, along with all gear and possessions.

#### Maze Discoveries

| d100 | Discovery |
|:---:|---|
| 01–70 | Nothing |
| 71–75 | Skeletal remains of an Omuan child |
| 76–84 | **Minotaur** that fights to the death |
| 85–87 | Blue crystal key |
| 88–90 | Gold crystal key |
| 91–93 | Purple crystal key |
| 94–96 | Green crystal key |
| 97–99 | Red crystal key |
| 00 | Black crystal key |

#### Sarcophagus
Any character who examines the sarcophagus notices a tiny keyhole carved into its lid. The keyhole does not penetrate to the interior of the sarcophagus, and there are no mechanisms within it to pick or disarm. The sarcophagus is impervious to damage and spells.

The crystal sarcophagus changes color every 6 seconds, shifting through the following repeating cycle: blue, gold, purple, green, red, black. If a crystal key claimed from the maze is inserted into the keyhole when the sarcophagus and the key are the same color, the sarcophagus lid disappears, and the contents of the sarcophagus are revealed (see "Treasure" below). At the same time, the character who retrieved the key from the maze receives a supernatural gift from a mysterious benefactor (see "**Acererak**'s Gift" below).

If a crystal key is inserted when the sarcophagus and the key are not the same color, the key is teleported back to the maze and the sarcophagus remains sealed.

#### Treasure
The sarcophagus is filled with salt, within which are buried ten opalescent bracelets (75 gp each) made from the shell of a flail snail (Unkh's animal form; see *appendix D*) and a *robe of scintillating colors*. The robe turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods (but see "Lost Treasures").

***Unkh's Spirit.*** The spirit of Unkh tries to inhabit any character who touches the *robe of scintillating colors* (see "Spirits of the Nine Trickster Gods"). When Unkh's spirit manifests, read:

>>Slime pours from the folds of the scintillating robe to take the form of multiple flail-like pseudopods. A female voice echoes through the chamber: "I can help you. At least, I think that's what I'm supposed to do."
>>

If the spirit successfully inhabits the character, give the player Unkh's card (see *appendix F*). If the attempt fails, the spirit returns to the robe and waits for another character to touch it.

#### Acererak's Gift
The character who retrieves the crystal key used to open Unkh's sarcophagus receives a supernatural gift from **Acererak** that varies based on the key's color. The character becomes aware of the gift when **Acererak**'s arcane sigil appears somewhere on his or her body. The source of the gift cannot be confirmed without consulting a higher power, but the mark can be removed with a *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic. These gifts otherwise follow the rules for charms in "*Other Rewards*," chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

***Black Key.*** The recipient gains a *charm of nine lives*. When you drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once used nine times, the charm goes away.

***Blue Key.*** The recipient gains a *charm of the crystal heart*. This charm grants you immunity to piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, but you gain vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. These effects last for 10 days, after which the charm vanishes from you.

***Gold Key.*** The recipient gains a *charm of treasure sense*. While this charm lasts, you can use an action to pinpoint, by scent, the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 30 feet of you. The effect lasts for 3 days, after which the charm vanishes from you.

***Green Key.*** The recipient gains a *charm of the swollen**hag*. This charm allows you to spit up a **frog** as an action. The frog understands you and obeys your commands. Once used three times, the charm goes away.

***Purple Key.*** The recipient gains a *charm of the maimed*. This charm allows you to regrow a lost appendage or organ, such as an arm, a foot, or an eye. After it is used once, the charm goes away.

***Red Key.*** The recipient gains a *charm of the ghoul*. This charm allows you to use an action to eat a mouthful of flesh from a humanoid that has been dead no longer than 1 day. When you do, you regain 3d8 + 3 hit points. Once used three times, the charm goes away.

### 56. Grandfather Clock
Any character approaching this room hears a rhythmic ticking sound from within.

>>This room contains a wooden cabinet with a numbered dial at its top set with two ornate metal spokes. Beneath the dial, a pendulum swings inside an open compartment. An egg-shaped stone adorns the pendulum's tip.
>>

This long-case clock radiates an aura of transmutation magic to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Unkh or Wongo receive advice when entering this area:

- Indecisive Unkh is struck by the technological wonder of the clock and wants to stay and marvel at its beauty.
- Deranged Wongo finds the ticking of the clock oddly soothing and urges his host to stay for a while.

#### Clock
Bronze chimes within the clock ring at the top of each hour. Any creature within 30 feet of the clock when it strikes the top of the hour must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or age by ten years. The effect can be reversed by a *greater restoration* spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring. When characters first arrive, assume the time is 5d10 + 5 minutes past the hour.

An invisible locked metal door shields the compartment containing the clock's pendulum. The invisibility effect on the door can't be dispelled, but the keyhole can be located by touch. The invisible key from the treasure chest in area 54A opens the lock, as does a *knock* spell. To pick the lock, a character must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools. If the character thinks to blow powdered chalk, dust, or a similar substance into the lock to highlight its gears, the check is made with advantage.

#### Treasure
The egg-shaped jewel fixed to the tip of the pendulum is the fabled Navel of the Moon. The fist-sized stone is worth 2,500 gp but can fetch up to three times that value if sold at auction in any major city. For more information on this item, see "Fabled Treasures."

If the egg is removed from the pendulum, the clock loses its magical properties and stops working.

### 57. Oubliette
Any creature that tries to magically transport itself out of the tomb arrives here instead.

>>You arrive in a room half-filled with rotting corpses. Protruding from one wall is a large green devil's face, its flared nostrils set just above the putrescent mass. A sconce above the face holds a flickering torch.
>>

The torch burns with a *continual flame* spell, illuminating the humanoid corpses that fill the room to a depth of 6 feet and make the area difficult terrain. As needed, **Acererak**'s magic draws new corpses here from graveyards across the world, all in various states of decay.

An **otyugh** feeds on the corpses and is presently buried under the heap in the southwest corner. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the creature's eyestalk poking up above the reeking mass. The otyugh eagerly attacks a lone character but avoids confrontations with multiple enemies. Once killed, the otyugh is not replaced.

#### Green Devil Face
The 8-foot-high devil face protrudes from the north wall. Any close inspection reveals that its nostrils contain hollow cavities, each one containing a stone lever. A pulled lever locks into place and can't be moved until it resets.

Pulling the lever in the left nostril causes the mouth of the devil face to open wide, revealing a gullet filled with impenetrable darkness that pulls in everything in the room. Initiative should be rolled for all creatures in the area. Any creature that starts its turn in the room and isn't secured in some fashion must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled into the gullet and destroyed. If a character fails the saving throw, another character within reach, or any character bound to the first character by a rope, can use his or her reaction to grab on and grant the first character a reroll. After 1 minute, the lever resets with an audible clunk. The gullet remains open until the lever resets. Magic has no effect on the gullet or the darkness within.

Pulling the lever in the right nostril causes the devil's eyes to glow red as all living creatures in the room (including the otyugh, if it's still alive) are teleported in front of the devil face at area 5B, along with whatever they are wearing or carrying. The lever then resets.

If the characters return to this room at a later time, the effects of the levers are reversed.

## Level 5: Gears of Hate
Map 5.5 shows this level of the dungeon. The Soulmonger draws power from the machinery on this level. The rumbling of that machinery echoes throughout all areas here, setting up tremors in the riveted metal panels that clad many of the walls, floors, and ceilings. The malign influence of an aboleth also pollutes this level.

![[083-515a.webp|right|300]]
#### Aboleth Slime
Puddles of viscid gray slime cover the floor in some areas, as marked on map 5.5. These areas are difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn in a puddle of slime or comes into contact with it for the first time on a turn takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage. A slime puddle is destroyed if it takes any cold, radiant, or necrotic damage. It is immune to all other types of damage.

#### Great Stone Gears
Areas 58, 59, and 60 are constructed within giant stone gears. When the characters arrive on this level for the first time, the gear rooms are configured as shown on map 5.5. Thereafter, the rooms can be rotated using the controls in area 61. Their ceilings are disconnected from the walls, allowing the chambers to turn without reorienting the ceilings or the shaft in area 58.

### 58. Cog of Rot

>>A pungent stench fills this pentagonal room, the walls of which are covered with riveted sheets of iron. A wild garden full of sickly plants and rotting compost takes up most of the interior, and a narrow path hugs the walls between two exits. Jutting from the middle of the garden is a six-foot-tall rusty sprinkler. In the ceiling above the sprinkler, a ten-foot-wide shaft leads straight up.
>>

Whenever this room is rotated by the controls in area 61, the sprinkler draws water from the underground lake (area 65) to spray the plants in the room. Magic keeps the plants alive despite the lack of sunlight.

If the cogs are turned so that one of the doorways lines up with area 63 to the north, gas from that area billows into the garden and transforms random piles of compost into three **shambling mounds**, which rise up and attack any other creatures in the room. After 1 hour, the shambling mounds revert to dead compost.

The shaft in the ceiling ascends 15 feet to area 45. To scale the smooth walls of the shaft, a character needs a climbing gear or magic.

### 59. Cog of Acid

>>An acidic stench fills this pentagonal chamber, which has two exits. The walls are covered with riveted sheets of iron, and the pockmarked stone floor has a large puddle of gray slime in the middle of it. Friezes along each wall just beneath the ceiling depict five black dragons.
>>

Gouts of acid are meant to rain down from the mouths of the dragon friezes whenever this room is rotated by the controls in area 61, but the acid compartments in the ceiling are currently empty. Consequently, nothing happens when the room turns. Any character who can get close enough to the ceiling to examine the friezes notices tiny holes in the dragons' mouths.

### 60. Cog of Blood

>>Five teak wardrobes stand against the ironclad walls of this chamber, each with a door bearing a carved image or scene. Puddles of gray slime cover parts of the floor. The room has two exits, including an adamantine portcullis blocking a passage to the north. Set into a metal plate above the portcullis is a row of five red crystals shaped like drops of blood.
>>

The adamantine portcullis is impervious to damage and spells, and its bars are spaced 4 inches apart. A Tiny or gaseous creature can slip between the bars easily.

To raise the portcullis, monsters from all five wardrobes must be summoned and slain in this room. Only one wardrobe can be opened at a time, and until that wardrobe's monsters are defeated, all other wardrobes in the room are sealed and unopenable. When all of a wardrobe's monsters die, the wardrobe disappears and one of the red crystals above the portcullis lights up. When all five crystals are lit, the portcullis rises and remains up for 24 hours. Once this duration ends, the portcullis lowers back into place, the crystals go dark, and the wardrobes reappear with their doors closed.

Each wardrobe contains a one-way gate to another plane, which deactivates if the wardrobe is removed from this chamber or destroyed. Any creature attempting to pass through a wardrobe's gate from this side is forced back and cannot enter.

Each wardrobe weighs 250 pounds, stands 6½ feet tall, and radiates an aura of conjuration magic to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. A wardrobe is a Medium object with AC 11, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

#### Acheron Wardrobe
The scene on this door depicts an army of orcs clashing with an army of hobgoblins. When the door is opened, read:

>>Dust and smoke billow from the wardrobe, and the air around you sounds out with the roar of battle. Beyond the doors, armies fight under a blood-red sky that has an iron cube floating in it like a huge, distant moon. Clouds of ash suddenly fly out of the wardrobe, transforming into screaming orcs before your eyes.
>>

Opening the wardrobe summons an **orc war chief** and seven **orcs**. Their bodies, armor, and weapons remain in this chamber when they die.

#### Gehenna Wardrobe
This door depicts a grinning night hag with a swaddled human infant in her arms. When it is opened, read:

>>The door opens above the caldera of an active volcano. Shards of black rock float above the molten magma. Perched atop one shard are two man-sized creatures with insectoid features and four arms apiece.
>>

Opening the wardrobe reveals two **mezzoloths**, which teleport into the room and attack. When a mezzoloth dies, its body transforms into wisps of oily smoke, though its trident remains.

#### Mechanus Wardrobe
This door is carved to depict the face of an ornate clock. When the door is opened, read:

>>Enormous interlocking gears and cogs stretch as far as you can see. Suddenly, a spherical construct with spindly legs and small wings tumbles through the open doorway.
>>

Opening the wardrobe summons a clueless, disoriented **monodrone** that lands prone at the characters' feet. It then tries to right itself and reenter the wardrobe, but is rebuffed by the wardrobe's magic. The modron fights only in self-defense and disintegrates if destroyed.

#### Nine Hells Wardrobe
The scene on this door depicts twisted, screaming humanoid faces wrapped in chains. When the door is opened, read:

>>Waves of heat assail you as the door opens, revealing an iron road leading to a basalt citadel surrounded by the charred remains of defeated armies. Prisoners scream from iron gibbets that festoon the citadel walls. Suddenly, a single glowing ember flies out of the wardrobe and transforms into a winged, bony fiend with a smiling, skull-like visage.
>>

Opening the wardrobe summons a **bone devil**. When it dies, its body transforms into a pool of stinking ichor.

#### Shadowfell Wardrobe
The scene on this door depicts ghouls gnawing on bones. When the door is opened, read:

>>You gaze out across an ancient cemetery, its canted tombstones shrouded in fog. Eerie, hungry shapes move among the graves in the distance. Suddenly, bright glowing balls of light appear in the room behind you.
>>

Opening the wardrobe summons four **will-o'-wisps**, which are invisible until they attack. Nothing remains of them when they are destroyed.

### 61. Control Room

>>A four-foot-high, seven-foot-wide iron lectern in the middle of this rusty, iron-plated room is topped by a slanted control panel. Set into the control panel are a gold lever with a star-shaped handle, two dials in red and blue, and two buttons of the same colors. Wall engravings behind the control panel show five groups of circles, with a small crystal embedded in the wall under each one. The crystal under the configuration labeled "3" glows bright green. Three six-inch-diameter rusty iron pipes jut from the wall above the engravings.
>>

When the characters reach this room, give the players a copy of handout 24 in appendix E. It shows the control panel atop the iron lectern, as well as the wall engravings and rusty pipes. Inspection of the pipes reveals traces of the same gray slime found in puddles throughout this level.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Papazotl, Unkh, or Wongo receive advice when entering this area:

- Shrewd Papazotl asserts that the blue controls are helpful and the red controls are baleful. (This is pure guesswork on his part.)
- Fretful Unkh thinks she can figure out what the controls do by studying them. If her host allows her an hour of study and contemplation, she concludes that the controls are a mystery and should be left alone.
- Violent Wongo urges his host to smash the controls.

#### Concealed Crawlway
A hidden crawlway runs from the underside of the lectern to area 70, but it cannot be accessed from inside this chamber. Any character who enters the crawlway from area 70 discovers a stone lever in the wall at the south end of the crawlway. Pulling the lever slides the lectern aside to reveal an access point.

#### Control Panel
The control panel is a Medium object with AC 15, a damage threshold of 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying the panel disables the controls and causes arcs of lightning to momentarily erupt from the iron lectern. Each creature in the room must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by lightning, taking 11 (2d10) lightning damage.

The controls atop the iron lectern have no labels, so their purpose must be discovered with experimentation.

***Blue Dial.*** This dial can be turned to the left or right, and it snaps back to center if released. The blue dial determines which wall crystal is lit. Currently, the crystal under configuration 3 is illuminated. If the dial is turned, the currently lit crystal goes out and the crystal to the left or right (the direction the dial is turned) lights up.

***Blue Button.*** Pushing the blue button orients the cog rooms (areas 58 through 60) to match whichever configuration has its crystal lit. The entire level trembles as the giant cogs rotate. If the blue button is pushed while the cog rooms are rotating or already in their proper configuration, nothing happens.

***Gold Lever.*** The lever begins in the up position. If pulled to the down position, the lever locks in place and aboleth slime (see "Aboleth Slime") begins to pour into the room through the iron pipes above the wall engraving. If the pipes are plugged with cloth before the lever is pulled, the slime is prevented from flowing into the room, but the pipes can't be stuffed while slime is pouring out of them.

The slime covers the floor to a depth of 1 inch per round. If the crawlway to area 70 is exposed (see "Concealed Crawlway" above), the slime does not accumulate in the room and instead pours into the crawlspace.

The lever's locking mechanism can be released with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools. If released, the lever automatically shifts to the up position, shutting the valves in the pipes and stopping the flow of slime. The lever can be torn from the console with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, which has the same effect.

The gold lever has another function, which is revealed in area 67.

***Red Button.*** Pushing the red button causes a 6-inch-thick wall of iron to drop from the ceiling in the doorway, sealing off the east exit. Any creature in the doorway when the wall drops must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to one side of the barrier or the other (its choice). On a failed save, the creature is pinned under the wall, falls prone, and takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage. A pinned creature is restrained, can't stand up, and takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns until it crawls out from under the door or another creature pulls it free, either of which requires an action and a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. The iron wall remains locked in place for 1 hour, after which it rises back into the ceiling on its own. It can't be lifted or pried open, though a *knock* spell causes it to retract into the ceiling. While the iron wall is down, pushing the red button has no effect.

***Red Dial.*** This dial can be turned to the left or right, and it snaps back to center if released. Turning the dial to the left establishes a two-way telepathic link between the creatures in this room and the aboleth in area 65. Turning the dial to the right ends the link. The telepathic link to the aboleth also ends for any creature that leaves the control room. Because the communication is telepathic, all participants can understand one another even if they don't speak the same language. Roleplay the aboleth using the information in area 65.

The aboleth is accustomed to speaking only with **Withers** and refers to the wight by his original name of Gorra. If the characters activate the telepathic link, the first thought the aboleth sends is an exasperated, "What now, Gorra?" Once the aboleth realizes it's telepathically linked to strangers, it wants to know all about them for no reason other than to satisfy its curiosity.

#### Cog Configurations
Handout 24 (see appendix E) shows the five different configurations for this level of the dungeon:

**Configuration 1**. Open doorways connect area 58 to areas 60 and 63. Area 59 is cut off, as are exits to areas 61, 62, and 67.

**Configuration 2**. An open doorway connects areas 58 and 63, but a doorway leading to area 59 ends in a blank wall. Area 60 is also cut off, as are exits to areas 61, 62, 67, and 68.

**Configuration 3**. As shown on map 5.5.

**Configuration 4**. An open doorway connects area 58 to area 62. Area 59 and area 60 are cut off, as are exits to areas 61, 67, and 68.

**Configuration 5**. Open doorways connect areas 59 and 61, as well as areas 60 and 67. Area 58 is cut off, as are exits to areas 62 and 68.

### 62. Stone Juggernaut
This area is a dead end—in more ways than one.

#### 62A. "Awaken Napaka!"

>>This hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. Up ahead, flickering lights dimly illuminate a larger hall running perpendicular to this one. Where the two halls meet, words have been scrawled on the ceiling in dried blood.
>>

A secret door in the west wall slides open to reveal a dark tunnel leading to areas 26 and 66. At the spot marked X on map 5.5, bloody words on the ceiling read, "AWAKEN NAPAKA!"

![[084-516.webp|right|300]]

#### 62B. Sloped Hall

>>Large puddles of gray slime spread across the floor of this ten-foot-wide, gently sloping hallway. Candles flicker on riveted sconces, casting dim light across a sequence of sculpted reliefs depicting humanoids with bestial heads kneeling before a black star. At the lower end of the hall, a thick purple drape hangs wall to wall. At the upper end, the hallway terminates.
>>

The hall slopes down toward area 62C. Area 62D lies to the west, behind a secret door that spans the entire wall (see that area for more information).

***Candles.*** Six magic candles are spaced 10 feet apart on alternate sides of the hallway. The candles don't burn down as long as they remain in this area.

***Secret Crawlway.*** Hidden behind a bas-relief depicting a crocodile-headed humanoid holding up a trapezoidal chest, a crawlway leads to area 62D. Close inspection of the relief reveals that the chest's keyhole is real. The jade key found in area 53 can be used to unlock the relief and swing it open, revealing the crawlway. The lock can also be picked with a successful DC 21 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools. But if the check fails by 5 or more, the secret door in the west wall slides open to release the stone juggernaut (see "Napaka Awakens" in area 62D).

#### 62C. Broken Statue
The hallway comes to a dead end 15 feet beyond the purple drape.

>>A six-foot-tall statue of a leering four-armed gargoyle stands against the back wall. One of its arms has broken off and lies on the floor in front of it, its hand curled into a tight fist. The other three arms have their clawed hands open in such a way as to suggest they're meant to hold something. Carved into the wall above the statue is a riddle:
>>
>>Three I need
>>
>>Then three more
>>
>>Three more still
>>
>>Opens the door
>>

The gargoyle statue is impervious to damage and spells, but its broken-off arm is not. If three gemstones are placed in the three open hands of the statue, the hands magically close into fists that crush the gemstones to powder. The statue's hands then open again. If this exercise is performed twice more, so that nine gemstones in total are crushed, the hand of the broken-off arm opens and a fist-sized ruby appears in it. The ruby is the Eye of Zaltec, which is teleported from area 62D by the sacrifice of the gems. If the ruby is plucked from the gargoyle's hand, the statue magically opens its mouth and exhales a cloud of soporific gas that fills the eastern 15 feet of the hall. At the same time, the secret door at the west end of the hallway slides open, and the stone juggernaut in area 62D rolls down the corridor.

Each creature in the gas cloud that is not immune to the poisoned condition must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 hour. The effect ends on a creature that takes damage.

#### 62D. Secret Room
The secret door to this room spans the entire wall and can't be opened by force or magic. It opens only when triggered by the characters' actions in area 62B or 62C.

Two-thirds of this room is taken up by **Acererak**'s **stone juggernaut** (see *appendix D*). The archlich named the juggernaut after Napaka, a dead Omuan queen (see area 53). If the characters enter the room through the crawlway and haven't yet awakened the juggernaut, it remains inert and does not attack unless it takes damage or the secret door slides open.

***Napaka Awakens.*** When the stone juggernaut is activated, read:

>>The wall at the west end of the hall slides back to reveal a stone juggernaut on rollers. The construct fills the height and width of the hall and barrels toward you at alarming speed.
>>

All creatures present must roll initiative. On its turn, the juggernaut rolls down the hallway, making a Slam attack against any creature standing in its way and using its Devastating Roll feature to crush small or prone enemies. When no enemies are left alive, it returns to the secret room. The juggernaut can't fit into any space less than 10 feet wide, and it doesn't have room in the hallway to turn. It attacks by rolling forward and backward.

Hidden in the tomb of the real Napaka (area 53) is a magic scepter, the adamantine head of which reduces the juggernaut to 0 hit points and turns it to dust on contact. While the juggernaut is inert, no attack roll is needed to strike it with the scepter. If the juggernaut has been awakened, a character can use the scepter to make a melee weapon attack against the juggernaut, reducing it to 0 hit points and turning it to dust on a hit.

***Treasure.*** Unless it has been teleported to area 62C, a lustrous, spiked ruby as big as a human fist sits on a stone shelf that juts from the west wall of the room. This gemstone is the fabled Eye of Zaltec. It is worth 5,000 gp but can fetch up to five times that value if sold at auction in any major city. For more information on the Eye of Zaltec, see "Fabled Treasures."

If the Eye of Zaltec was teleported to area 62C, the shelf is bare.

### 63. Gas-Filled Room
This chamber is closed off and inaccessible most of the time. The characters can reach this area by reorienting the cogs so that a doorway opens up to area 58.

>>Thick green gas billows out of skull-shaped nozzles set into the walls of this cramped room. A rotting corpse clad in studded leather armor lies on the floor, mouth open and hands grasping its throat. Wrapped around one of its arms is a yellow band.
>>

The green gas that fills this room fills area 58 when the two rooms are open to each other, but the gas is too heavy to rise up the shaft into area 45. The gas has two effects:

- It transforms the dead vegetation in area 58 into three shambling mounds (see that area for details).
- It is poisonous to non-plants. Any creature susceptible to the gas that starts its turn in a gas-filled area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature is affected even if it holds its breath or doesn't need to breathe.

Stuffing the nozzles with cloth prevents more gas from spilling into the room. If the characters block the flow of gas, the lingering gas disperses after 1 minute.

#### Treasure
The dead figure on the floor is Lord Brixton, the Cormyrean leader of the doomed Company of the Yellow Banner. He died when **Withers** rotated the cogs from area 61 and trapped him in this room.

The corpse wears studded leather armor and carries a sheathed longsword with a dragon-shaped hilt. The sword has a minor magical property: its bearer gains the ability to speak and understand the Draconic language.

Next to Lord Brixton's body is a dungeoneer's pack, tucked inside which is a pouch containing six carnelian gemstones (50 gp each).

### 64. Base of the Waterfall
Anything that falls from area 17 ends up here.

>>The walls of this grotto are slick with slime, and the air reeks of decay. Filthy water tumbles down from a hole in the ceiling, then courses along a rough-hewn tunnel toward a murky lake. The din of machinery echoes from that direction.
>>

Climbing the slimy walls requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. The water here is 30 feet deep. Characters who allow themselves to be carried by the current are swept gently into area 65.

### 65. Underground Lake

>>A dark underground lake opens up before you, its ceiling festooned with chains and gears—some of which appear to have dwarves dangling from them. A gigantic motionless stone cog rises from the water, with two matching cogs connected to it. Rusty metal conduits stretch from the cavern walls to the cogs. The water of the lake is slimy, with pinpricks of phosphorescent light twinkling in the murk.
>>

The cavern ceiling is 20 feet above the foul surface of the lake, which is 20 feet deep. Any creature that drinks the water is poisoned until it regurgitates the liquid, which happens automatically in 1d4 minutes. The lights at the bottom of the lake are phosphorescent **crabs** that feed on the muck. Each crab sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius but stops glowing 10 minutes after being removed from the water.

The three stone cogs of areas 58 to 60 are half-submerged in the water and rise 10 feet above its surface. Their uneven upper surfaces are difficult terrain, and their smooth outer walls can't be scaled without climbing gear or magic.

The Mechanus chain (area 69) drives the machinery in this cavern, feeding power to the Soulmonger and to the many traps and other mechanisms within the dungeon. At any given time, 1d4 + 1 tomb dwarves in leather harnesses dangle from the ceiling while performing routine maintenance on the gears and giant cogs. Each tomb dwarf has the statistics of a **wight**, except that it wields a battleaxe and a light crossbow. The tomb dwarves ignore intruders unless they are attacked, in which case they defend themselves with their crossbows.

#### Lurker in the Lake
An **aboleth** named G'lyh'rul (guh-LEE-rool) lives in the lake. When **Acererak** enslaved it, the aboleth lost its mind and developed a split personality. Its dominant aspect awaits the coming of the death god, which it believes heralds the fall of divinity. Until that day, the aboleth humbly obeys **Withers** (whom the creature refers to by his original name of Gorra) and attacks anyone seeking to prevent the atropal's ascension. The aboleth's other personality is that of a humanoid child—harmless, gleeful, and insanely curious. In this state of mind, the aboleth poses no threat to anyone and flees if attacked. Roll any die to determine which personality is dominant at any given time. On an even result, the aboleth's childlike personality is dominant.

If the characters explore the lake using the rowboats in area 66, the aboleth ignores them regardless of its current demeanor, unless they draw undue attention to themselves. In the event of combat, the aboleth is not the master of the lake and has no lair actions as a result.

Ancient beyond reckoning, G'lyh'rul has accumulated tens of thousands of years of knowledge. If the characters establish telepathic communication with the aboleth and it is inclined to speak to them, it can provide information as if the characters had cast a *commune* spell. (Since they're not actually casting the spell, this effect is not subject to the restrictions on spellcasting within the Tomb of the Nine Gods.) After sharing this information, the aboleth grows bored and withdraws to a dark corner of the lake to dream of evil things.

### 66. Door of Devouring
If the characters approach this area by way of the spiral staircase (area 26), read the following when they reach the bottom of the stairs:

>>At the bottom of the staircase, a dark corridor leads south, while a stone door with iron hinges and a brass knob stands to the east.
>>

If the characters approach this area from the lake, read:

>>A worked stone column stretches from the bottom of the lake to the cavern roof and is attached to the nearby wall by a stone conduit. On one side of the column, steps of moss-covered stone climb from a stone dock to a landing whose stone door shows no handles or hinges. Ropes lash a pair of rowboats to a dock post, and a rusty iron cage wallows in the slime, held afloat by chain and winch. Phosphorescent crabs gather at the bottom of the lake below the cage.
>>

The stone door separating the mooring area from the spiral staircase (area 26) radiates auras of abjuration, conjuration, and illusion to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. The door can be opened easily from the west side simply by pulling on the brass knob. The door is much harder to open from the east side.

#### Hungry Door
The mossy staircase that climbs up out of the lake and the landing at its top are strewn with bits of crab shell. If any character touches or inspects the door, read:

>>A monstrous mouth forms on the door's surface, calling out with a deep drawl: "I'm so hungry I could eat you alive, but I'll settle for somethin' else. Somethin' livin'. Somethin' light!"
>>

The mouth is similar to that created by a *magic mouth* spell, but more powerful. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 19) cast on the door suppresses its magic for 10 minutes, preventing the mouth from forming. However, the door cannot be opened without the mouth except from the west side, not even with a *knock* spell.

The mouth isn't programmed to say anything else, but its words (and the crab shells underfoot) provide the characters with a clue regarding how to open the door. If the mouth is offered a live phosphorescent crab, it opens wide, chomps down to consume the crab, then spits out its crushed shell. Once the mouth has been fed, it disappears and the door into area 26 swings open. The door locks and the spell resets if the door is closed again.

If a character tosses anything into the mouth that isn't a phosphorescent crab, the mouth spits it out. If the character is within 10 feet of the door when this happens, the door wraps its tongue around the character and swallows the character whole. No attack roll or saving throw is required. A character "devoured" in this manner is teleported to area 57.

#### Diving Cage
A rusty iron gate on the side of the cage provides ingress for two Medium or smaller creatures. The cage radiates transmutation magic to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect, and bestows the effect of a *water breathing* spell on any creatures within it. The stout bars grant half cover against attacks originating from outside the cage.

Using the winch, a character on the steps can lower the cage 20 feet to the lakebed, allowing characters in the cage to easily harvest 2d6 phosphorescent **crabs** from the muck.

The creaking descent of the cage draws the attention of the aboleth in area 65. If the aboleth's crueler personality is dominant, it attempts to enslave any characters in the cage. If it succeeds, it sends them back to the surface with orders to entice others down into the depths. If the aboleth's childlike personality is dominant, it swims over and uses its telepathy to strike up a friendly conversation with the divers.

#### Rowboats
The two rowboats have the names *Predator* and *Prey* etched into their transoms. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of transmutation magic around each vessel. Each boat can hold up to four Small or Medium creatures and their gear, and each contains two oars, an empty wooden bucket, and a 50-foot-long coil of hempen rope.

***Predator.*** Creatures aboard the *Predator* have advantage on attack rolls while the boat is in the water. A filled bullseye lantern hangs off the boat's bow.

***Prey.*** Creatures aboard the *Prey* have advantage on saving throws while the boat is in the water.

### 67. Hall of the Golden Mastodon
A character who searches for traps in the tunnel approaching this room notices a block of stone lodged in the ceiling with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The block remains there until the room's trap is activated.

>>A life-size golden statue of a mastodon stands atop a one-foot-high stone cog at the center of this room. Jeweled tusks sweep from its jowls, and its trunk is raised in a roar. Inscriptions coil around the statue's body, and murals on the walls show a Chultan warrior riding a living mastodon through a series of hellish landscapes. In each scene, a different breed of devil assails them.
>>

The murals on the walls tell the story of Ch'gakare (pronounced chuh-GAH-kah-ree), a Chultan warrior who stole his king's prized steed: a mastodon named Ghom. As punishment, the king's sorcerers banished Ch'gakare and Ghom to the Nine Hells, but the two fought their way back home. On his return, Ch'gakare chopped off the king's head and turned his skull into a jeweled chalice. Any character who studies the murals and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the legend and can recount it. The murals show Ch'gakare and Ghom fighting spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, horned devils, and erinyes.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of I'jin, Obo'laka, or Shagambi receive advice when entering this area:

- Unpredictable I'jin wants to ride the golden mastodon!
- Nervous Obo'laka is afraid of the golden mastodon and urges her host to not provoke its anger.
- If the challenges faced by Ch'gakare and Ghom are recounted to her, wise Shagambi concludes that the hall was constructed to present similar challenges.

#### Golden Mastodon
When the characters first enter the room, the 10-foot-high mastodon statue is facing the entrance. The statue's lifelike qualities owe to the fact that this is Ghom, whose body was preserved in magical iron and covered with a thin layer of hammered gold, and whose tusks have been set with gems (see "Treasure" below).

The inscriptions on the statue are written in Old Omuan. They read as follows:

>>Let your bones watch over my treasure, brave Ghom. As you carried me from the inferno, so shall I rise from death to defend my riches.
>>

Scratches on the floor beneath the stone cog indicate that it can rotate, yet no amount of pressure budges it. Any search of the top of the statue reveals a star-shaped indentation on the back of its head. Those who have seen the gold lever in area 61 recognize the lever's star-shaped handle as a perfect match. If the lever is claimed and set head-first into the indentation, read:

>>A thunderous trumpeting sound erupts from the mastodon's trunk, causing a block of stone to seal off the room. The cog under the mastodon's feet then begins to revolve, letting the statue face each of the murals in turn.
>>

The block of stone fills the space in the hallway indicated on map 5.5. Any creature under the block when it falls must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the creature moves out of the block's way in whichever direction it prefers. On a failed save, the creature takes 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage. If this damage reduces the creature's hit points to 0, the creature is crushed to a pulp; otherwise, it is shoved into the room.

When the mastodon statue begins to revolve, all creatures present should roll initiative. The statue turns counterclockwise and completes one 360-degree revolution on initiative count 0 of each round.

When the statue completes its first revolution, magical fire engulfs the floor and the cog, flaring up 6 feet high. Any creature that enters the fire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. Any character perched on the golden mastodon is shielded from the flames. Up to six Medium creatures can perch on the mastodon at once—four on its back and one on each of its curved tusks.

Each time the statue turns to face north, one or more devils emerge from the murals and attack all other creatures in the room. Roll initiative for each group of new arrivals. Each magically summoned devil vanishes in a puff of smoke when it drops to 0 hit points or when there are no creatures left to attack. The devils appear in the following order, emerging from the walls wherever you see fit:

**Round 2**: Four **spined devils**

**Round 3**: Three **bearded devils**

**Round 4**: Two **barbed devils**

**Round 5**: One **horned devil**

**Round 6**: One **erinyes**

If the characters try to strike a bargain with the devils, only the erinyes is willing to engage them—but it demands the willing sacrifice of one character's soul. A character who offers his or her soul to the erinyes is destroyed by fire. The character's soul becomes trapped in the Soulmonger, the character's belongings are left behind, and all remaining devils in the room disappear in clouds of smoke.

#### Ch'gakare
When the last devil is defeated or when the party strikes a deal with the erinyes, the mastodon statue returns to its original north-facing position and stops revolving. When this happens, read:

>>The fires go out, though smoke still hangs in the air. A warm wind blows through the hall, carrying the scent of jasmine, frankincense, and grave dust. The smoke coalesces into a decayed warrior wrapped in bandages. He holds up a gruesome chalice made from a human skull.
>>

![[085-517.webp|right|300]]

The undead warrior is Ch'gakare, barely recognizable as the man riding the mastodon in the wall murals. He has the statistics of a **revenant**, but he can't be destroyed. If reduced to 0 hit points, Ch'gakare turns to smoke, vanishes, and reforms in his tomb somewhere in the distant jungle.

Ch'gakare does not speak but holds up the chalice in a manner that suggests he's offering it as a gift. If the chalice is taken from his hand, Ch'gakare turns to smoke and is gone. The stone block that seals off the room retracts into the ceiling when Ch'gakare disappears.

#### Treasure
If stripped off, the mastodon's gold leaf is worth 2,500 gp, though it takes a character 30 hours to claim it all. Multiple characters working together can shorten the time proportionately. Fifty gemstones (100 gp each) can also be pried loose from the mastodon's tusks.

Ch'gakare's gift is the fabled Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare. This item is worth 2,500 gp but can fetch up to four times that value if sold at auction in any major city. Alternatively, returning the chalice to Princess Mwaxanaré yields its promised reward (see "Kir Sabal"). For more information on the chalice, see "Fabled Treasures."

### 68. Hall of Decay

>>Graven images of rotting corpses decorate this hall, and the floor is littered with tarnished coins, pieces of armor, broken shields, axe heads, and other bits of scrap metal.
>>

All nonmagical objects made of cloth, leather, wood, or metal that enter this corridor instantly decay or corrode to the point of being useless and worthless. Clothing and armor falls apart, shields and weapons become brittle and ineffective, and so forth. A *mending* spell cannot repair an object damaged in this fashion.

An archway stands at the west end of the hall, through which characters can see into area 69.

>>This yawning archway has a keystone adorned with an iron bull's skull, which bites down on an ivory ring.
>>

A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of necromancy magic emanating from the ivory ring. If the ring is yanked from the skull's jaws, it disintegrates and the destructive effect in the hallway ends.

The staircase on the south side of the hallway descends 25 feet to area 71 on level 6.

### 69. Mechanus Chain

>>Hot wind tinged with the smell of burning oil blows down a forty-foot-diameter vertical shaft. Stone balconies protrude from the walls on opposite sides of this expanse, with the west balcony fifteen feet higher than the east one. Two thick chains rattle in the gulf between the balconies—one ascending two hundred feet before disappearing into a cloudy vortex lit by arcs of purple lightning; the other wrapping around an enormous metal gear floating one hundred feet below. Another hundred feet below the gear, a second vortex rages.
>>

To drive his infernal machinery, **Acererak** contaminated a workforce of modrons from the plane of Mechanus. Under the stewardship of a corrupt pentadrone, the modrons rerouted one of their great chains into the tomb. The sections of the shaft above and below the balconies exist outside of normal space, preventing the shaft from intersecting with the tomb's other levels.

#### Modron Intervention
The first time any character moves out onto a balcony, read:

>>A rip forms in the vortex high above, and nine cube-shaped creatures with wings and shortbows fly through. They are quickly followed by a large crystal decahedron that holds a weird starfish-shaped creature.
>>

A **pentadrone** leads a squad of nine **quadrones** through the upper planar vortex, which allows safe passage into the shaft but not out of it. Knowing that they cannot return to Mechanus, the modrons fight until destroyed. Once these modrons are dealt with, the shaft becomes undefended. No other modrons are sent through the vortex.

The pentadrone can't fly on its own, but it gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover while encased in the crystal decahedron, which grants its occupant total cover against attacks that originate outside the vehicle. The pentadrone can't make melee attacks through the decahedron, but it can use a bonus action to open a small hole in any of the decahedron's facets in order to spray creatures with its paralysis gas.

The decahedron has AC 16, 50 hit points, immunity to poison damage, resistance to piercing and slashing damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, the crystal decahedron shatters and the pentadrone falls.

The crystal decahedron has enough room to accommodate one Small or Medium creature in addition to the pentadrone if a character thinks to enter the vehicle using *misty step*, *dimension door*, or similar magic. Inside the vehicle, the pentadrone can attack as normal. When the pentadrone dies, the decahedron shatters.

#### Planar Lore
Characters with proficiency in the Arcana skill can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to determine what, if anything, they recall about planar vortices and Mechanus chains. With a successful check, a character learns the appropriate lore and all lore with a lower DC:

**DC 10**: Planar vortices are incredibly destructive. No one can expect to enter a vortex and survive.

**DC 15**: The chain is called a Mechanus chain. Such chains are crafted by modrons and used in conjunction with other machinery to keep the plane of Mechanus in working order.

**DC 20**: This Mechanus chain has been repurposed for the tomb. One chain would be enough to keep the tomb's traps and other mechanisms in working order.

**DC 25**: Destroying a Mechanus chain requires the casting of three *wish* spells.

#### The Shaft
The shaft is 400 feet high in total and features deadly planar vortices at top and bottom. Any creature in the shaft that enters a planar vortex is torn apart, its body and possessions scattered across the multiverse.

The Mechanus chain forms a loop in constant motion. One part of the chain descends at a rate of 50 feet per round, wrapping around the giant gear that floats 100 feet below the east balcony, while the other part of the chain climbs to enter the upper vortex at the same rate.

The two balconies are separated by a 15-foot-wide gulf, through which jangling chain links rise and fall. Magic that allows characters to fly or to walk on walls makes it easy to cross from one balcony to the other. Any character who moves at least 10 feet beforehand can jump from the west balcony to the east balcony. Because the west balcony is 15 feet higher than its eastern counterpart, a character must either pole vault across the gap (using a 10-foot pole or similar item) or use magic. A character can also cross the expanse by leaping from one balcony to the nearest chain, from that chain to the other, and finally to the opposite balcony. Each of these jumps requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Any character who fails a check made to jump to a balcony or chain falls down the shaft and into the lower planar vortex unless somehow halted. A falling character can land on the floating gear 100 feet below with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw but takes falling damage as normal.

### 70. Armillary Sphere

>>This chamber contains a bronze apparatus centered on a hinged arm. Slowly rotating within the arm is a 10-foot-diameter globe decorated by a topographic map of landforms and oceans. Concentric rings of brass constrain the device, all rotating and bearing their own lesser spheres. One of those spheres has sharp points and appears sunlike. Carvings of tall, headless humanoids decorate the walls of the room.
>>

The armillary sphere depicts Toril, its moon, the sun, and other planetary bodies in Realmspace. Any character who has viewed large-scale maps of Faerûn will recognize certain geographical features on the globe.

#### Activating the Sphere
The first time any creature moves within 5 feet of the central globe, read:

>>The apparatus suddenly swings around, its rings rotating out of the way as the surface of the globe peels back to reveal a dark, hollow interior. Inside this cavity is a padded bronze chair with levers built into its armrests.
>>

When a creature sits on the armillary chair, the globe closes again. Any attempt to prevent that closing overloads the mechanism; until the blockage is removed, any creature within 5 feet of the armillary sphere that isn't seated on the chair takes 18 (4d8) lightning damage.

When the creature seated on the chair stands up, the globe's hatch opens, closing again only when another creature sits on the chair or when there are no creatures within 5 feet of the armillary sphere.

While the globe is sealed, the character sitting in the chair can see through the globe as if it were made of transparent glass. Pulling the levers at the end of each armrest causes the armillary sphere's rings to spin the representations of the sun, the moon, and other planetary bodies in one direction or the other.

#### Monster in the Moon
A **nycaloth** is crammed inside the bronze orb representing Toril's moon, Selûne. The first time a creature inside the armillary sphere reorients its rings and outer orbs, the nycaloth bursts out of the moon, shattering it. The nycaloth then tries to kill all other creatures in the room, pursuing fleeing enemies. It ignores creatures inside the globe but attacks any creature that exits it.

When this nycaloth rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll made with its greataxe, it cuts off the target's head (or one of the target's heads, if it has more than one). If the target can't survive without the lost head, it dies. A target that is immune to slashing damage is immune to this effect. The target is also spared decapitation if it doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or if its head is too big to be cut off with the greataxe, though it still takes the damage from the weapon's critical hit.

#### Critical Conjunction
If the rings are spun so that all the celestial bodies are lined up, roll on the Armillary Sphere Conjunction table to determine what happens. Once a conjunction effect occurs, the armillary sphere breaks down, causing the levers to lock in place and the hatch to lock shut.

The locked hatch is a Large object with AC 11, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. As long as the outer rings and orbs aren't in motion, the hatch can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, or opened with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check made by character using thieves' tools.

#### Armillary Sphere Conjunction

| d100 | Conjunction Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 01–05 | The armillary sphere and any creatures inside it disappear. The DM ultimately decides where they end up, if anywhere. Possibilities include Mechanus, the Vast Swamp on Oerth, Mount Nevermind on Krynn, a desert on Athas, Victorian London on Earth, or the sun. |
| 06–15 | The creature sitting in the armillary chair is touched by an unknown entity and suffers a radical personality change. Work with the player to determine an appropriate change. |
| 16–30 | A *cloudkill* spell is cast within the globe. |
| 31–50 | The sun-shaped orb splits open, spilling 5,000 gp onto the floor. |
| 51–65 | The creature sitting in the armillary chair gains a *charm of heroism* (see "*Supernatural Gifts*" in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). |
| 66–80 | Every creature within 20 feet of the armillary sphere regains 50 hit points. Creatures inside the globe do not gain this benefit. |
| 81–90 | A *gem of brightness* appears on the lap of the creature seated in the armillary chair. |
| 91–99 | The Intelligence score of the creature seated in the armillary chair permanently increases by 1d4 + 1, up to a maximum of 22. |
| 00 | The creature seated in the armillary chair is granted the ability to cast the *wish* spell once. |

#### Secret Crawlway
A secret door in the south wall conceals a crawlway that leads south and passes underneath the control room. See area 61 for details.

## Level 6: Cradle of the Death God
Map 5.6 shows this level of the dungeon. Here, the dreaded Soulmonger nurses the atropal to godhood. A coven of hags called the Sewn Sisters guards the nursery, which remains sealed until five **skeleton keys** are used to unlock it. If the characters failed to obtain all five skeleton keys from the upper levels, they won't get far on this level. If you want to keep the adventure moving forward rather than have the characters backtrack, place the remaining skeleton keys in area 71 or somewhere else nearby.

![[087-520a.webp|right|300]]
### 71. Lair of the Sewn Sisters

>>Green smoke billows out from a bronze cauldron in the middle of this twenty-foot-high vaulted hall. Barely visible through the haze are three rocking chairs, several work benches heaped with haberdashery, a spinning wheel, and a rusty iron cage containing a prisoner. Galleries stand ten feet above the floor to either side of the room.
>>

The green smoke makes this chamber lightly obscured and blocks the characters' view of a great green door to the south (see "Skeleton Gate" below). The iron cage and its prisoner are described in the "Cage" section.

When the characters are in a position to get a better view of the upper galleries, read:

>>Five wooden doors are set into the walls of the galleries, each carved with a geometric symbol: a triangle, a square, a pentagon, a hexagon, and an octagon.
>>

This chamber belongs to the Sewn Sisters, a coven of three **night hags** loyal to **Acererak**. Together, the hags mother the atropal and guard the Soulmonger. They eagerly await the atropal's apotheosis, when the downfall of civilization promises an abundance of souls to harvest. The Sewn Sisters spy on intruders from the Border Ethereal. Any character who can perceive creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane sees the hags as spectral figures huddled in the middle of the room. See "The Sewn Sisters" sidebar for more information.

#### Hag Dolls
Each hag has created a cruel plaything: a doll brought to life through the implantation of a child's soul. When the adventurers arrive, these dolls scurry into view:

>>Three tiny figures waddle toward you through the smoky haze: a straw doll with rusty pins sticking into its body, a faceless child molded from clay, and a stuffed monkey with the lower body of a unicycle. The straw doll says, "You need to run away! The Sewn Sisters will be back any moment now!"
>>

Each doll is a Tiny construct with AC 10, 1 hit point, a walking speed of 10 feet, immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and no attacks. Destroying a doll causes the child's soul within it to become trapped in the Soulmonger.

The straw doll, Strawbundle, usually speaks for the group. Clay No-Face can speak only if it molds a mouth onto its blank face, and Joho the monkey coughs on its stuffing when it tries to talk. Given a chance, the dolls share the following information:

- The Sewn Sisters are three night hags. The dolls refuse to mention the hags by name, lest the hags hear their names being uttered.
- The dolls were made from the souls of children and want to be free of the captors.
- The hags are nursing some kind of creature that lurks on the other side of the skeleton gate (the great green door), but the dolls don't know what the creature is.
- To learn more about the adventurers, the hags have been torturing the "lookie-like" in the cage.

If the characters take an interest in the skeleton gate, the dolls reveal what they know about it:

- Five skeleton keys are needed to unlock the skeleton gate. Each key looks like an animated skeleton with a skull that extends into a carved key-like shape.
- The skeleton keys wander the upper levels of the tomb.
- Before the skeleton keys can be used, the skeleton gate's five keyholes must first be opened. The five adjoining rooms (areas 72 to 76) contain trials that can be overcome to open the five keyholes.

The dolls don't know the nature of the trials in areas 72 through 76, and they can't leave this chamber unless they are picked up and carried out.

If any character makes an effort to befriend one of the dolls, the soul of the child trapped inside the doll bestows a magical charm on that character. Each doll can bestow its charm once. These charms are similar to the ones described in *chapter 7* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* and follow the same rules.

***Strawbundle's Charm.*** While you have Strawbundle in your possession, this charm allows you to cast the *etherealness* spell as an action, no components required. After it is used three times, the charm vanishes.

***Clay No-Face's Charm.*** While you have Clay No-Face in your possession, you don't need to eat, drink, or breathe. These benefits last for 30 days while the doll is in your possession, after which the charm vanishes from you.

***Joho's Charm.*** While you have Joho in your possession, it grants you the benefit of a *helm of comprehending languages*. This benefit lasts for 7 days while the doll is in your possession, after which the charm vanishes from you.

> ##### The Sewn Sisters
>**Acererak** recruited three night hags for their expertise in stitching soul bags—a craft they adapted for the creation of the Soulmonger. The hags are a frightful lot:
>
>**Widow Groat** has tarnished gold coins covering her eyes and ants nesting in her skull. The ants serve as her spies, and their presence often portends her arrival. She carries a heartstone, a soul bag, and an iron ring with eight keys. The keys unlock the shackles in area 78.
>
>**Peggy Deadbells** wears a string of chattering children's teeth and thumps about on a heavy peg leg. When she laughs, yellow gas billows out of her nose and ears. Around her neck, she wears a pouch made from gnome skin, inside which is a heartstone and five lustrous black marbles (see area 81). Tied to Peggy's rope belt is a soul bag.
>
>**Baggy Nanna** has a squirming leather sack sewn over her head. The bag also contains a cockerel, a viper, and a terrier. One animal can emerge from the bag in place of her own head to speak on her behalf, and the animals become smoke when Baggy Nanna dies. In her pockets, she carries a heartstone, a soul bag, and three goblin fingers.
>
>The night hags have a shared pool of spells (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the Monster Manual). The scarecrow **Mister Threadneedle** (see area 74) carries the coven's hag eye.
>
>For more information on heartstones and soul bags, see the "Night Hag Items" sidebar in the Monster Manual.
>

#### Cage
A heavy padlock secures the gate of the rusted cage, inside which a naked figure cowers under a bloodstained blanket.

**Mister Threadneedle** (see area 74) carries the key to the padlock, which can otherwise be unlocked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check made using thieves' tools. The lock can also be broken off easily enough.

The cage's prisoner is a degenerate clone of one of the player characters and is instantly recognizable as such. It was created from blood or strands of hair obtained by one of the hags while the character slept. Characters had a slight chance of meeting the hag as a random wilderness encounter (see *appendix B*); however, when and where the theft occurred is up to you.

The clone is not a perfect copy. It is shorter and scrawnier than the character after whom it's modeled, and it has deformities. Use the **commoner** statistics to represent this creature, applying racial traits as appropriate.

The clone has no name and no memory of having been created. However, the hags have forged a magical link between the clone and the character from which it was made. The clone knows everything the character knows, up to and including all present knowledge. The hags have been interrogating the clone to learn everything about the adventurers. Now that they have no more use for such information, the Sewn Sisters plan to kill and eat the clone.

#### Cauldron
A tarry greenish-black brew fills the bronze cauldron. Any creature that drinks the brew is stunned for 1d10 minutes. While stunned, the creature succumbs to seizures brought on by the dark dreams of the atropal.

The bronze lid of the cauldron lies on the floor nearby. If the lid is placed on the cauldron, the green smoke that fills the room dissipates after 1 minute.

#### Skeleton Gate
When the characters get close enough to make out the details of the green door, read:

>>This twelve-foot-high, ten-foot-wide door is made of green stone, its surface carved with grinning goblin skeletons. A belt of smooth stone spans the door at a height of four feet, set with five gold symbols in a row: a triangle, a square, a pentagon, a hexagon, and an octagon. Each symbol is engraved on a recessed circular seal.
>>

![[089-519.webp|right|300]]

The geometric symbols are 6 inches across, 1 foot apart, and set into stone disks 8 inches in diameter. Hidden behind the seals are five keyholes that conform in size and shape to the heads of the skeleton keys found on the other tomb levels (see "Skeleton Keys").

Each time the characters complete a trial in areas 72 through 76, one stone seal rolls aside, exposing the keyhole behind it. When a **skeleton key** is inserted into its corresponding keyhole and turned clockwise, a tumbler inside the door unlocks. When all five tumblers unlock, the skeleton gate can be pulled open like a normal (albeit heavy) door, revealing a wide staircase that descends 20 feet to area 77. The door and its seals are impervious to damage and spells, and cannot be opened in a manner other than that which is prescribed above.

***Facing the Night Hags.*** If the characters manage to open all five keyholes and have the requisite skeleton keys in their possession, the Sewn Sisters emerge from the Border Ethereal and attack them. The hags' goal is to seize one or more of the skeleton keys, thus preventing the characters from reaching the Soulmonger. If a hag obtains a **skeleton key**, it cackles as it returns to the Border Ethereal with it.

If two hags die, the third tries to bargain with the characters, offering useful information in exchange for her life. The hag makes the characters swear on their mortal souls not to harm her once her information is divulged. Any character who reneges on the agreement contracts slimy doom, as though he or she had failed a saving throw against the *contagion* spell. The hag reveals the following information (and nothing more) once an agreement is reached:

- "Hidden on this level of the dungeon is a library of lost lore, guarded by an arcanaloth whose true name is Ygga Raxyg." (See area 80 for details.)
- "There is only one way to leave the dungeon: the ebon pool. Charred bones point the way." (See area 81 for details on the ebon pool. "Charred bones" refers to the charred skeleton on the floor in area 79.)
- "The Red Trail leads to death." (See area 79.)

### 72. Trial of the Triangle
The door to this area has a triangle carved into it. When the characters open the door, read:

>>A five-foot-wide, floor-to-ceiling glass cylinder near the back wall of this room is filled with light, the source of which is not apparent. A tiny triangular hole is cut through the glass, five feet above the floor. Inside the cylinder, an iron lever is set into a metal plate on the floor.
>>

To reach the lever, the characters must figure out a way to enter or bypass the cylinder. If the lever is pulled, the triangle seal on the skeleton gate in area 71 rolls aside, revealing a triangular keyhole behind it.

The cylinder is 5 feet in diameter, shaped of glass 2 inches thick. The triangular hole in the glass is 1 inch wide. The cylinder is normally impervious to damage and spells, and it can't be moved. A character in *gaseous form* can enter the cylinder through the hole, while an ethereal character can pass through the glass. A character can also use *misty step*, *dimension door*, or similar magic to enter the cylinder. A magically summoned creature can appear inside the cylinder, as can an *unseen servant*, either of which can be commanded to pull the lever. The lever is too heavy to be moved with a *mage hand* spell but responds to a *telekinesis* spell.

If three creatures stand around the glass cylinder, forming the points of a triangle around it, the cylinder turns brittle and can be shattered with any solid hit. Once the cylinder is destroyed, anyone can walk up to the lever and pull it.

### 73. Trial of the Square
The door to this area has a square carved into it. When the characters open the door, read:

>>This room is filled with flying sheets of parchment, with writing on the pages visible as they flutter by. A metal plate bolted onto the far wall is set with a ghostly lever.
>>

The flying pages are from a spellbook and are destroyed if they take any amount of fire damage. A character can use an action to grab a page as it flutters past with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. Written on the page is a random spell; roll a d6 to determine the spell's level, then randomly choose a spell of that level from the wizard spell list.

If more than three pages are taken, all the remaining pages in the room turn to dust, which coalesces into a hostile **dust mephit** and three illusory duplicates created by a *mirror image* spell. The mephit attacks all other creatures in the room, with its duplicates appearing to follow suit.

The mephit knows three command words: "bloatbug," "frogspittle," and "spindledash." While in this room, it can speak one command word as a bonus action on it turn, triggering the associated magical effect below. It can't speak the same command word two rounds in a row.

**Bloatbug**: The mephit targets one creature within 30 feet of it that it can see, which immediately increases its weight by 50 percent. Any spell that ends a curse, such as *greater restoration* or *remove curse*, ends the effect and returns the creature to its normal weight.

**Frogspittle**: Each creature in the room must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage. (The mephit is immune to poison damage.)

**Spindledash**: The effect targets a random creature in the room. Have the players roll a d20 for each character in the room, and roll a d20 for the mephit and each other creature in the room. Whichever creatures roll the lowest take 21 (6d6) force damage.

When the dust mephit dies, it collapses and transforms into a stick of black chalk.

#### Phantom Lever
The lever on the north wall is carved from bone but is insubstantial, such that a character's hand passes right through it. The lever appears solid to a creature on the Ethereal Plane, and an ethereal creature can pull it normally. *Dispel magic* has no effect on the lever, which remains insubstantial even within the area of an *antimagic field*. If any creature uses chalk to draw a square on the wall around the lever, the lever becomes solid. If the square is erased, the lever turns insubstantial again.

If the lever is pulled, the square seal on the skeleton gate in area 71 rolls aside, revealing a square keyhole behind it.

### 74. Trial of the Pentagon
The door to this area has a pentagon carved into it. When the characters open the door, read:

>>The delicious aroma of spiced meat greets you. At the end of a twenty-foot-long corridor, a room opens up with red tapestries covering the walls. A feast is spread out on three tables, consisting of roast boar, squash stew, and a tray of iced cakes. Flagons of frothy beer complete the banquet.
>>
>>A gaunt human male in a dusty black suit quietly arranges the items on the cake table, taking notice of your intrusion. Without a word, he gestures for you to come forward and sample the feast.
>>

The gaunt gentleman is **Mister Threadneedle**, the Sewn Sisters' manservant. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of illusion magic around him. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 16) reveals his true form.

**Mister Threadneedle** is a **scarecrow** disguised with magic to appear human. In a pocket, he carries the Sewn Sisters' *hag eye* (see the "Hags" entry in the *Monster Manual*) and one lustrous black marble (see area 81). **Mister Threadneedle** understands Common but can't speak. He communicates by nodding and shaking his head, or with gestures and facial expressions.

Warned of the adventurers' arrival, the hags prepared this magical feast and instructed **Mister Threadneedle** to lay it out. The scarecrow attacks the characters only if they attack first, or if the hags command him to.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Kubazan or Nangnang receive advice when entering this area:

- Wild Kubazan urges his host to try the roast boar.
- Greedy, skittish Nangnang urges her host to hoard all the iced cakes and shun the frothy beer.

#### Magical Feast
The food is well prepared and delicious, and the beer is rich. Any character who partakes of the feast gains benefits and suffers detrimental effects based on what is consumed. Do not reveal detrimental effects to the players until those effects come into play.

**Roast Boar**: The character feels stronger and has advantage on Strength checks, but has disadvantage on attack rolls made against Widow Groat. Both effects have a duration of 24 hours.

**Squash Stew**: The character feels healthier and gains advantage on Constitution saving throws, but has disadvantage on attack rolls made against Peggy Deadbells. Both effects have a duration of 24 hours.

**Iced Cakes**: The character feels energized and gains 2d10 temporary hit points, but has disadvantage on attack rolls made against Baggy Nanna for the next 24 hours.

**Frothy Beer**: The character gains a special die: a d6. Anytime in the next 24 hours, the character can roll this die once and add the result to a d20 roll he or she just made. Additionally, if the character is inhabited by the spirit of a trickster god, the power normally granted by the spirit is suppressed for 24 hours.

Characters who enter the room but do not partake of the food or drink are cursed with crippling hunger as soon as they leave this area. The effect imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and it can be ended on a character with *greater restoration*, *remove curse*, or similar magic.

#### Tapestries
Five red tapestries hang from iron rods bolted to the walls. Each is made up of pentagonal patches stitched together. Any character who inspects the tapestry on the southwest wall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check sees something more: a subliminal devil's face cleverly hidden in the design. The devil's open mouth forms a pentagon. A character can reach into the devil's mouth as though the fabric wasn't there, uncovering a small extradimensional compartment with a glass lever set into the back of it. The compartment can be accessed only from the front side of the tapestry, and only while the tapestry is hanging on the wall. If the tapestry is taken from the room or destroyed, a new one materializes on the wall in 4d6 hours.

If the lever in the tapestry is pulled, the pentagon seal on the skeleton gate in area 71 rolls aside, revealing a pentagonal keyhole behind it.

### 75. Trial of the Hexagon
Carved into the door of this room is a hexagon. When the characters open the door, read:

>>A large, cracked, six-sided mirror is mounted above a stone shelf protruding from the opposite wall. Five unlit candles stand on the shelf, each made of yellow wax and covered with tiny black sigils. Scrawled on the wall above the mirror in dried blood are the words "PIGGY PIGGY PIGGY."
>>

A sixth candle, identical to the five in plain view, is tucked out of sight under the stone shelf. Any character who searches the shelf for traps or hidden compartments automatically finds the sixth candle. Both the mirror and the candles radiate auras of conjuration magic to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect.

#### Cracked Mirror
The cracked mirror can't be pried from the wall or damaged more than it already is.

If all six candles are lit, a character who looks in the mirror and says the word "piggy" three times in a row sees the reflected candlelight reveal a wooden lever set into a metal panel on the north wall. If fewer than six candles are lit when the words are spoken, the lever appears on the south wall instead. These levers exist only in the mirror's reflection, not in reality.

Only a character who can see a lever reflected in the mirror can pull it. As this likely puts the lever out of the character's reach, he or she can cast a *mage hand* or *telekinesis* spell, conjure an *unseen servant*, lasso the lever with a rope, or undertake any suitably clever solution.

***True Lever.*** If the north lever is pulled, the hexagon seal on the skeleton gate in area 71 rolls aside, revealing a hexagonal keyhole behind it.

***False Lever.*** If the south lever is pulled, three insane **wereboars** in hybrid form magically spring from the mirror, land in the middle of the room, and fight to the death. When the wereboars have nothing left in the room to fight, they join the night hags in area 71.

The wereboars can be summoned only once. Pulling this lever again has no effect.

### 76. Trial of the Octagon
Carved into the door of this room is an octagon. When the characters open the door, read:

>>The ceiling of this plaster-walled room is fifteen feet high. A leather-backed tome rests open atop a wooden lectern bolted to the floor. Set into the wall behind the lectern are eight human skeletons, arranged so that they appear to be falling and screaming.
>>

The skeletons are inanimate remains embedded into the plastered walls. The lectern is held in place by four bolts set deep into the floor and is impervious to damage, spells, and attempts to move it. The book's covers are secured to the lectern with *sovereign glue*, preventing it from being easily removed. The eight-page book contains an eight-line nursery rhyme written by the Sewn Sisters in Infernal, with each page bearing one line of the poem. The book is open to pages 4 and 5 when the characters first arrive.

Hidden in the leg of the lectern, on the side facing the east wall, is a secret compartment that can be found with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

If the lines of the nursery rhyme (see below) are read aloud in reverse order, starting with the last line and ending on the first, the doors of the secret compartment open, revealing a brass lever inside. If the lever is pulled, the octagon seal on the skeleton gate in area 71 rolls aside, revealing an octagonal keyhole behind it.

The compartment can also be opened with a *knock* spell, or with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools. Opening the compartment in either manner triggers the trap (see "Spider Fan Trap" below).

#### Nursery Rhyme Book
Any character who understands the Infernal tongue can translate the hags' nursery rhyme as follows:

>**Page 1**: Backward, backward, eight to one.
>
>**Page 2**: Speak the rhyme until it's done.
>
>**Page 3**: Keep the spider locked away.
>
>**Page 4**: See the lever, clear as day.
>
>**Page 5**: Spin, spin, iron spider.
>
>**Page 6**: Turn their flesh and bones to cider.
>
>**Page 7**: Speak the rhyme and meet your fate.
>
>**Page 8**: Forward, forward, one to eight.
>

#### Spider Fan Trap
Any character who inspects the floor of the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices thin seams along the floor's perimeter that suggest a pit below. The seams are meant to deceive adventurers and make them wary of the floor, which doesn't actually have a pit underneath it.

The real danger is the ceiling, which appears to be smooth-cut stone but is actually thin plaster. Five feet above the false plaster ceiling is the room's true ceiling, which has a bladed fan shaped like a giant iron spider mounted to it.

If a character in the room reads the entire nursery rhyme beginning with the first line on page 1 and ending with the last line on page 8, or if the compartment in the lectern is opened improperly, the ceiling fan begins to twirl as a *reverse gravity* spell activates within the room. The lectern is the only fixed object in the room. Any creature within reach of it can, with a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, grab the lectern and avoid falling upward. A creature that can't grab the lectern or isn't secured in some other way "falls" upward through the fake plaster ceiling into the rotating blades of the fan, taking 44 (8d10) slashing damage. The creature takes that damage again each time it starts its turn on the ceiling. The *reverse gravity* effect lasts for 1 minute, after which creatures on the ceiling fall back down to the floor 20 feet below. Once the spell ends, the ceiling fan stops twirling. The trap does not reset.

### 77. Death God's Nursery
Opening the skeleton gate in area 71 reveals a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-long staircase of polished black marble that descends to this area. When the characters reach the bottom of the stairs, read:

>>Crumbling balconies overlook a pool of lava filling this triangular chamber, above which is suspended an enormous crystal cylinder held in place by three adamantine struts. Wraithlike forms swirl inside the cylinder, and otherworldly screams hang in the air. Four long, writhing tentacles sprout from the cylinder's cap. A shriveled monstrosity the size of an elephant floats near the cylinder. Its body is wet and malformed, its arms and legs are atrophied, and its oversized head drips black goo. The creature is attached to the cylinder by a twisted umbilical cord.
>>

![[090-521.webp|right|300]]

The cylindrical device is the Soulmonger. The malformed creature floating next to it is an **atropal** (see *appendix D*), which feeds on the captured souls of the dead. The atropal attacks any creature that threatens it or tries to damage its food source. If the atropal dies, **Acererak** arrives to take his revenge (see "Acererak's Revenge" below).

The ceiling of the vault is 30 feet high, and the walls along the north balcony are lined with alcoves containing piles of skulls and bones—the remains of Old Omuans and their minotaur protectors.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by trickster spirits receive advice when entering this area:

- Fickle I'jin encourages her host to investigate the mist-filled archway on the south balcony (see "Mist Gate" below).
- Adventurous Kubazan expects his host to make the ultimate sacrifice and die in a blaze of glory.
- Kind Moa wants to free the souls trapped inside the Soulmonger.
- Greedy Nangnang urges her host to search the balconies and bone-filled alcoves for treasure.
- Nervous Obo'laka is concerned that the bones in the northern alcoves might rise up and attack.
- Shrewd Papazotl suspects that the atropal might be vulnerable to radiant damage and that killing it might summon forth its evil master.
- Virtuous Shagambi recognizes that the atropal is unholy and orders her host to destroy it at once.
- Contemplative Unkh urges her host to communicate with the atropal. Perhaps the creature is just misunderstood.
- Deranged Wongo wants his host to attack the tentacles sprouting from the top of the Soulmonger.

#### The Soulmonger
The Soulmonger is an upright crystal cylinder 20 feet high and 10 feet in diameter. The adamantine struts that suspend it above the lava attach to an adamantine ring around the cylinder's midsection.

Under the scrutiny of a *detect magic* spell or similar effect, the Soulmonger radiates an intense aura of necromantic magic. Destroying the Soulmonger not only ends the effects of the death curse (see the introduction to the adventure) but also frees all the souls trapped within the device. Freed souls travel to the afterlife, and any creature whose soul is set free can be brought back from the dead by magical means.

The Soulmonger is an artifact of evil—a Huge object with AC 15; 200 hit points; vulnerability to radiant damage; and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

***Adamantine Struts.*** One way to destroy the Soulmonger is to break any of the three adamantine struts that suspend it above the lava. Each strut is a Large object with AC 20; 100 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks; and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. When a strut drops to 0 hit points, it breaks and causes the other two struts to snap as the Soulmonger falls.

The struts are wide enough that Medium or Small creatures can walk along them without difficulty. However, any creature that takes damage while standing on a strut must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off it, plunging into the lava unless the creature is somehow secured.

Unless likewise secured, any creature standing on an adamantine strut when the strut breaks falls into the lava. If the creature is within reach of a balcony, it can leap onto the balcony and avoid the fall with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw.

***Tentacles.*** Once per turn, in response to any creature making a successful melee weapon attack against the cylinder or one of its struts, the Soulmonger attacks that creature with one of its 30-foot-long tentacles. The tentacle has a Strength score of 22 and makes one melee weapon attack against the creature: +7 to hit, 24 (4d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, a tentacle can grapple its target (escape DC 16). If the target weighs 330 pounds or less, the tentacle can also lift the grappled creature and move it to any unoccupied space within its 30-foot reach, or drop it in the lava.

The tentacles can be attacked and destroyed. Each one is a Huge animated object with AC 15, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

***Destroying the Soulmonger.*** When the Soulmonger drops to 0 hit points, read:

>>The crystal cylinder shatters, and a myriad of tiny lights pour forth from within. These bright souls coil through the air like a tornado, blazing upward and then vanishing in a blinding, spectral flash.
>>

If the atropal has not been destroyed, it shrieks as the souls of the dead escape from the wreckage of the Soulmonger.

#### Lava Pit
The lava pit is 30 feet below the floor of the room and 100 feet deep. Any creature that falls into the lava or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) fire damage. Any object that falls into the lava takes damage on initial contact and once per round thereafter until it is removed from the lava or destroyed.

#### Phylacteries
Along the east and west walls of the chamber, two balconies stand 30 feet above the lava pit.

>>Two facing balconies halfway along the room are littered by ornate glass bottles, fluted silver urns, ivory caskets, and other vessels—all of them inscribed with baleful sigils.
>>

**Acererak** has disciples scattered throughout the multiverse, including many liches that seek to become as powerful as him. He keeps their phylacteries here.

Each balcony has 2d6 + 5 lich phylacteries on it. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes the phylacteries for what they are. Destroying a phylactery is no simple task and often requires a special ritual, item, or weapon. The phylacteries here are all unique, and discovering the key to each one's destruction will require time and expensive research. There's a 10 percent chance that any one of these phylacteries would be destroyed by hurling it into the lava.

#### Mist Gate
The balcony at the south end of the room holds the gateway to the final chambers of the Tomb of the Nine Gods.

>>An ornate archway looms over this balcony. Grinning skulls are molded into its frame, and glowing mist swirls within.
>>

A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the gate. Any creature that steps into the archway emerges from a similar archway in area 78, along with anything it is wearing or carrying.

#### Acererak's Revenge
If the characters kill the atropal, read:

>>A skeletal figure wrapped in moldering robes and clutching a skull-tipped staff appears on the south balcony. Hateful pinpricks of white light burn in its eye sockets, and a two-foot-diameter sphere of utter darkness floats in the air beside it.
>>

**Acererak** (see *appendix D*) rolls initiative and attacks with all his power, hoping to slay the intruders and reap their souls. The archlich carries the *Staff of the Forgotten One* (see *appendix C*) and is accompanied by a *sphere of annihilation*, which he controls using a *talisman of the sphere* worn about his neck. Because the Tomb of the Nine Gods is not **Acererak**'s home, he has no access to lair actions during this battle.

**Acererak** speaks to the adventurers in condescending tones, referring to them as "puny mortals" as he sets out to destroy them.

***Wrath of the Trickster Gods.*** When **Acererak** appears, any character inhabited by the spirit of a trickster god hears that spirit cry out for vengeance. In addition to the power granted by his or her trickster god, the character gains the following benefits while he or she can see **Acererak**:

- The character gains 50 temporary hit points at the start of each of his or her turns.
- When the character makes an attack roll against **Acererak** and hits, the attack deals an extra 3d6 psychic damage.

#### Acererak's Defeat
If **Acererak** drops below 100 hit points, he casts *teleport* on his next turn and flees. As he departs, read:

>>"We'll meet again, fools!" says the lich. "And on that day, you will die!" With that, **Acererak** raises his staff, utters some arcane syllables, and is gone.
>>

If the characters succeed in killing **Acererak** before he has a chance to escape, read:

>>A look of horror passes over the lich's face as his body turns to dust. His tattered robes fall to the ground, as do his staff and talisman.
>>

**Acererak**'s body reforms near his phylactery, which is hidden in some far-flung demiplane, but his possessions are left behind for the characters to pilfer. The *sphere of annihilation* remains stationary until someone takes control of it using the talisman. Because it's not a creature, the sphere is not teleported if it enters the mist gate (see "Mist Gate" above).

### 78. Chapel of Hate
Any creature that passes through the mist gate in area 77 emerges from a similar arch set into the south wall of this room. The gate also allows travel back to area 77.

>>You step out of the mist into an underground chapel with black basalt pillars and a polished obsidian altar. Resting on the altar is a leather bag the size and shape of a human body, and which appears to have been sewn shut. Beyond the altar, a heavy black drape hangs from an archway.
>>
>>Eight emaciated, green-skinned creatures are shackled to the walls of the chapel, each one gazing toward you with a single baleful eye. The monsters begin to gibber and drool as they shake their manacles, eager to be set free.
>>

Once the atropal has fed on enough souls, **Acererak** plans to baptize it in the blood of a worthy sacrifice. This chapel was built for that dark ceremony. The Sewn Sisters obtained an appropriate sacrifice and have stitched it inside the leather body bag that rests on the altar.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of Moa or Wongo receive advice when entering this area:

- Kind Moa suggests freeing the shackled creatures.
- Violent Wongo urges his host to stab the body bag, making sure that whatever is inside it is dead.

#### Body Bag
The leather body bag can be cut open to reveal an unconscious prisoner, whose identity is yours to decide. It might be **Artus Cimber**, **Dragonbait**, Volothamp Geddarm, or some other NPC the characters never got the chance to meet. It could also be an NPC who became separated from the party in the course of the adventure.

If no suitable NPC springs to mind, use a captured member of the Order of the Gauntlet named Zalder Faelrond (LG male Tethyrian human **knight** of Torm, with no armor or weapons). Zalder's story is that he was kidnapped by the Sewn Sisters while patrolling the jungle. If set free, he requests an escort back to Camp Vengeance (see chapter 2).

The night hags' magic keeps the prisoner alive and unconscious. With a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check, a character determines that the effect can be ended only by splashing the prisoner with holy water.

#### Devotees of Acererak
The creatures shackled to the chapel walls are eight **nothics**—former disciples of **Acererak** who lost their minds trying to learn their master's arcane secrets. The nothics are restrained by the shackles and can't make melee attacks until they are set free. They speak Undercommon and demand to be released.

The night hag Widow Groat (see area 71) carries the keys to the nothics' shackles, which can also be picked with a successful DC 13 Dexterity check made by a character using thieves' tools, or sundered with a good, hard weapon strike.

If the characters ignore the nothics' demands, the spiteful creatures attack them using their horrid Rotting Gaze. If the characters unshackle them, the nothics loiter in the chapel and leave the party alone. They also provide the following helpful information if their liberators question them:

- If the characters are searching for an exit to the tomb, one nothic hops over to the black curtain, pulls it aside, points down the tunnel to the north (area 79), and shouts (in Undercommon), "Mind the bones!"
- If the characters are searching for treasure, another nothic performs the same actions as above, except it shouts, "Follow the purple trail!"

### 79. Hall of Finality

>>Behind the curtain is a ten-foot-wide, forty-five-foot-long hallway set with four decorative archways that have blank walls within them. Three paths marked out in red, gold, and purple tile snake along the floor, each leading to one of three archways. A charred skeleton on the floor points to the fourth archway, which has no path leading to it.
>>
>>A single torch burns in a wall sconce at the far end of the hall. Mounted below it is a bronze plaque that bears a warning in Common: "Behold the fate of those who defy me!"
>>

The torch remains lit and doesn't burn down as long as it remains in this corridor. If taken from the hall, it burns down normally.

#### Advice from the Spirits
Any characters inhabited by the spirits of I'jin or Shagambi receive advice when entering this area:

- Fickle I'jin wants her host to follow the purple-tiled pathway to see where it leads. (Purple is I'jin's favorite color, at least for now.)
- Wise Shagambi urges her host to not stray from the tiled pathways.

#### Charred Skeleton and Secret Door
The charred skeleton points to the arch containing a secret door that slides open to reveal area 81 beyond.

***Glyph of Warding.*** Opening the secret door triggers a *glyph of warding* spell, which targets all creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the door. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The triggering glyph is at the bottom right corner of the door and can be found with a successful DC 24 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***Wall of Fire.*** When the *glyph of warding* spell activates or is dispelled, a magical wall of fire springs up at the south end of the hallway, setting the black curtain ablaze if it still hangs there. The wall of fire spans the width and height of the hall. Any creature that enters the wall, starts its turn inside the wall, or starts its turn within 5 feet of the north side of the wall takes 22 (5d8) fire damage.

When the wall of fire appears, all creatures present should roll initiative. Each round on initiative count 15, the wall moves 10 feet northward, stopping only when it reaches 5 feet from the north wall. The wall lasts until there are no creatures in the hallway, or until it is dispelled with a successful *dispel magic* (DC 14).

#### Golden Trail and Secret Door
The trail of gold-colored tiles leads to the archway in the west wall that contains a secret door. Any character wearing the eye-shaped pendant found in area 2 can find the secret door without needing to make a check and can open the secret door without setting off the trap (see below). Behind the secret door is a dusty, web-filled hallway filled with sweet dulcimer music. The music gets louder as one approaches area 80.

***Glyph of Warding.*** Opening the secret door triggers a *glyph of warding* spell, which targets all creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the door. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The triggering glyph is at the bottom right corner of the door and can be found with a successful DC 24 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

#### Purple Trail
A trail of purple-colored tiles leads to the hall's northernmost arch. If a character walks along the trail without stepping off it, then touches the wall within the archway, the wall takes on the consistency of thick mud for 1 hour. While this effect lasts, any creature that passes through the wall, or any object pushed through the wall, emerges from the back wall of the alcove in area 80.

#### Red Trail
The short trail of red-colored tiles ends in front of the hallway's southernmost arch. A creature that walks along the red trail without ever stepping off of it, then touches the wall within the archway, is pulled into the wall and unceremoniously dumped into area 57.

### 80. Red Library
The characters might arrive here by way of the tunnel to the east, or through the alcove in the southwest corner if they activate the purple-trail archway in area 79.

>>Soft dulcimer music fills this room, the walls of which are painted the color of dried blood. Bookcases draped in cobwebs and dust line the walls and stand four deep in the middle of the room. Hundreds of leather-bound tomes weigh down their sagging shelves. At one end of the room, a small study contains a padded leather chair, a footstool, and a small table—as well as three corpses dangling upside down from shackles and chains bolted to the ceiling near the north wall. A lantern-shaped device resting atop the table appears to be the source of the music. An old man lies asleep in the chair, his horn-rimmed spectacles slipping down to the end of his nose.
>>

The library contains the collected wisdom of a hundred sages, along with a few spellbooks and scrolls (see "Treasure" below).

The corpses hanging along the north wall are the remains of three archmagi who tried to meddle in **Acererak**'s affairs. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check confirms that all three died within the past month and that destructive spells were the cause of their demise.

The old man sleeping in the chair is an **arcanaloth** under the effect of its *alter self* spell. The fiend has one of the library's spellbooks lying open on its lap and pretends to be asleep. If approached, the man appears to wake and asks, "Why do you disturb me?" The creature won't reveal its true name, instead referring to itself as "Mr. Fox." The arcanaloth is bound to the library by **Acererak**'s magic and can't leave, nor can it allow any of the library's books or scrolls to be removed.

If any character speaks the arcanaloth's true name ("Ygga Raxyg"; see area 71) within earshot of the fiend, it is stunned for 1 minute. Once the stunned effect wears off, repeating the arcanaloth's name has no effect on it for the next 24 hours. If killed, the arcanaloth melts into a pool of ichor, leaving behind its robes and horn-rimmed spectacles (see "Treasure" below).

#### Alcove
The alcove in the southwest corner of the room is empty. If the magic at the end of the purple trail is still active (see area 79), the back wall of the alcove has the consistency of thick mud. Any creature that passes through the wall, or any object pushed through the wall, emerges from the northernmost archway in area 79.

#### Treasure
The arcanaloth's horn-rimmed spectacles aren't magical, but they are worth 250 gp. The spectacles are also a gate key that opens a portal in the planar city of Sigil. The portal is a two-way door to the plane of Arcadia. A *legend lore* spell cast on the spectacles reveals this information and raises their potential value to 2,500 gp if they are sold to a wizard or sage.

The object on the table is a music box made of dark wood with gold filigree. A *detect magic* spell or similar effect reveals an aura of conjuration magic around it. Each of its five sides is sculpted with the image of a horned woman playing a different musical instrument: a dulcimer, a flute, a harp, a lyre, and a viol. While touching the box, a creature can use an action to make it play music featuring one of the instruments shown, which can be heard up to 60 feet away. The character can also use an action to stop the music. The music box is worth 750 gp.

The library contains two hundred historical texts (50 gp each), sixty tomes of arcane lore (100 gp each), three dusty *spell scrolls* (*create undead*, *fabricate*, and *resurrection*), and six spellbooks. The first three spellbooks contain 1d6 spells each of 1st through 3rd level. The fourth and fifth spellbooks contain 1d4 spells each of 4th through 6th level. The sixth spellbook has a title (*X the Mystic's Arcane Grimoire*) burned into its spine and contains 1d3 spells each of 7th through 9th level.

### 81. Ebon Pool

>>A pool of jet-black ooze glistens inside this silent chamber, whose walls are decorated with relief carvings depicting black stars.
>>

The pool radiates an aura of conjuration magic to a *detect magic* spell or similar effect. Creatures that come into contact with the ooze are unharmed. Any object that isn't being worn or carried by a creature disappears if submerged in the black ooze. Such items are permanently lost, having been transported to a secret demiplane whose location cannot be divined. Any amount of ooze that is removed from the pool disappears instantly.

#### Activating the Pool
Peggy Deadbells (in area 71) and **Mister Threadneedle** (in area 74) have black marbles in their possession that can be used to activate the pool. If one of these black marbles is tossed into the pool, read:

>>The black marble sinks into the ooze, which rises up suddenly to form a four-foot-tall black obelisk—a miniature version of the obelisk that stood outside the tomb entrance.
>>

Any creature that touches the ooze obelisk is teleported, along with all objects it is wearing and carrying, to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the obelisk outside the tomb entrance (area 1). This effect is not subject to the magical wards that prevent teleportation spells from functioning within the tomb.

The ooze obelisk sinks back into the pool and disappears after 1 minute. Tossing another black marble into the pool causes the obelisk to reform.

## Conclusion
Destroying the Soulmonger frees the souls trapped inside it and ends **Acererak**'s death curse. Characters who accomplish this goal will have saved many lives, and if word spreads of their heroism, wealthy and influential NPCs come forward bearing gifts of thanks. These gifts can take many forms, including parcels of land and special favors (see "*Marks of Prestige*" in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). If the characters allow the atropal to survive in the depths of the tomb, it eventually attracts nihilistic devotees of **Acererak** who feed it their own dark souls as nourishment.

### Lost Treasures
As they explore the tomb, characters are likely to find one or more fabled treasures as well as magic items inhabited by the spirits of Omu's dead trickster gods. What happens to these items when the characters leave the tomb is discussed below.

#### Relics of the Past
**Acererak** placed four treasures in the tomb as lures: the Black Opal Crown, the Eye of Zaltec, the Navel of the Moon, and the Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare. These items can be kept, sold to interested buyers, or returned to their rightful owners.

***Black Opal Crown (Area 49).*** The yuan-ti of Omu are after this treasure. If they can't wrest it from the characters, they attempt to buy or steal the crown from the individual to whom the characters sell it. Whether the crown has the power to set loose Dendar the Night Serpent is up to you. Should the crown fall into the wrong hands, characters might need to venture into the caverns below the Peaks of Flame to retrieve it before the world ends.

***Eye of Zaltec (Area 62).*** The Company of the Yellow Banner was vanquished trying to obtain this lost jewel, which is rumored to have the power to resurrect the ancient dead. If the Eye of Zaltec indeed has such power, it requires a great many sacrifices to function. Tabaxi thieves might try to steal the jewel and bear it safely back to Maztica, perhaps trading it for the release of enslaved loved ones. Conversely, a villain might buy the jewel and use it to resurrect a dead tyrant, an evil archmage, or some even greater threat.

***Navel of the Moon (Area 56).*** If the characters try to sell this stone in Baldur's Gate, Port Nyanzaru, or some other city, word of the sale quickly reaches the spies of wealthy Calishite merchants. A bidding war might ensue, or assassins might be sent to retrieve the stone and quietly dispose of its new owner. Whether the stone has its purported power to reunite families separated by time and fate is entirely up to you.

***Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare (Area 67).*** Princess Mwaxanaré can't afford to pay characters what this treasure is worth, and she will despise them for selling it to someone else. Three of Port Nyanzaru's merchant princes express interest in buying the chalice: **Ifan Talro'a** wants to add it to his private collection of Chultan relics, Kwayothé wants to melt it down, and **Zhanthi** wants it for sentimental reasons. Denying any one of them would be a grave mistake on the characters' part and might result in them receiving an ominous Ytepka Society token.

#### Magic Items of the Trickster Gods
Certain magic items—specifically those in which the spirits of the nine trickster gods reside—turn to dust and are destroyed as soon as they exit the tomb. These items include Obo'laka's *ring of protection* (area 10), Moa's *staff of the python* (area 14), Wongo's *mace of terror* (area 16), Papazotl's *amulet of health* (area 22), Nangnang's egg-shaped *pearl of power* (area 24), I'jin's horn-shaped *wand of wonder* (area 35), Kubazan's *bracers of archery* (area 42), Shagambi's *instrument of the bards* (area 48), and Unkh's *robe of scintillating colors* (area 55).

If, in your estimation, a player did an extraordinary job roleplaying a trickster god's flaw, the god's spirit might reward that player's character by allowing its magic item to exist outside the tomb, provided that character is attuned to the item when it leaves the tomb.

### Syndra's Fate
Characters who survive the Tomb of the Nine Gods won't know the fate of **Syndra Silvane** until they return to Port Nyanzaru, use a spell such as *scrying* to spy on her, or reach out to her with a *sending* spell or similar magic. If the characters destroy the Soulmonger and Syndra is still alive, priests quickly restore her to full health, and the characters can collect their promised reward. If Syndra dies but her soul is saved before the atropal devours it, she is raised from the dead within a tenday of the Soulmonger's destruction and honors her agreement with the party. In the event that Syndra dies and her soul is devoured, her body lies in state pending a funeral and proper burial.

### Artus and the Ring of Winter
**Artus Cimber** is unwilling to part with *Ring of Winter*. He is justifiably concerned that the ring would dominate and control any other owner. Furthermore, Artus would begin to age as a normal human without the ring, and he wants to live forever with his beloved Alisanda.

**Xandala**, the Harpers, the Zhentarim, and frost giants loyal to Jarl Storvald won't stop searching for the *Ring of Winter*. If the characters make their way back to civilization with Artus in tow, they should encounter one or more of these groups along the way. **Valindra Shadowmantle** and the Red Wizards of Thay also won't pass up a chance to take the ring by force.

With or without the ring, **Artus Cimber** continues to await Mezro's return while searching for the means to reach or summon the displaced city. Nothing matters to him more than reuniting with his wife. Characters interested in helping Artus can use divination spells or downtime to conduct research. They might also consult with the Harpers, who have access to lore that might assist Artus in his quest, but they demand the ring in exchange for their assistance. Forced to choose between the Harpers' assistance and the ring, Artus chooses the latter. Alternatively, a portal to Mezro's demiplane might be hidden somewhere in Chult, creating the seeds of a wonderful new adventure.

### Dragonbait
If he's with the characters when they escape from the Tomb of the Nine Gods, **Dragonbait** is eager to put Omu and this adventure behind him. As long as **Artus Cimber** is alive, **Dragonbait** remains committed to helping his friend find the displaced city of Mezro. If Artus is dead and there's no hope of raising him, **Dragonbait** opts to return to Port Nyanzaru, where he drowns his sorrows in a few casks of tej before enjoying some downtime. The saurial gives off the scent of roses as he waves farewell to the party. He eventually crosses paths with Volothamp Geddarm, and the two explorers embark on numerous adventures together.

### Omu
Unless the characters cleared out the Fane of the Night Serpent, Omu remains in the clutches of the yuan-ti. If **Ras Nsi** is still alive, he has no further use for the characters once the death curse is ended. Believing they know too much for their own good, he sends a party of yuan-ti to capture or kill them before they leave the city. If the party obtained the Black Opal Crown, they can trade the item for their lives.

If **Fenthaza** lives, **Ras Nsi** makes the mistake of putting her in charge of the team sent to kill the characters, and she offers the party a deal instead. If the characters agree to kill **Ras Nsi**, they can go free and keep whatever treasure they take from the fane except for the Black Opal Crown, which **Fenthaza** insists be given to her at once. If the characters defeat **Ras Nsi** handily, **Fenthaza** honors her end of the deal. If they emerge from the fane weakened, she tries to destroy them.

Princess Mwaxanaré wants to restore Omu to its former glory and build a new kingdom there. With the Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare in her possession, she can win the support of Chultans eager to return to the old ways. However, the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru aren't willing to back her claim, and the yuan-ti won't give up Omu without a fight. It could take years for Mwaxanaré's dream to come true, if it ever does.

### Red Wizards of Thay
News of the Soulmonger's destruction annoys **Valindra Shadowmantle**. Using her *teleportation circle*, she returns to Thay and informs Szass Tam that her mission in Chult has failed. Angered by the party's interference, Szass Tam sends new operatives and powerful undead to spy on the characters, learn their weaknesses, and (eventually) dispose of them. If the characters have friendly ties to the Harpers or the Zhentarim, spies working for one faction or the other learn of the Red Wizard plot and can warn the characters.

### Acererak the Eternal
**Acererak** keeps his phylactery hidden, and neither gods nor spells can divine its location. If his physical body is destroyed, **Acererak** reforms next to his phylactery in 1d10 days. The archlich isn't quick to avenge his defeat. He prefers to let time—his most powerful ally—slay the adventurers. Once they're dead and gone, he sets out to make life miserable for their descendants.

### More Adventures
This concludes *Tomb of Annihilation*. Space limitations preclude us from exploring Chult in its entirety, but you can create your own Chult-based adventures and publish them at the Dungeon Masters Guild ([http://www.dmsguild.com](www.dmsguild.com)).

# Appendix A: Character Backgrounds
During character creation, players can select the following backgrounds for their characters with your approval. These backgrounds are appropriate for any character or campaign associated with the discovery and exploration of exotic cultures and lost civilizations.

- Anthropologist
- Archaeologist
---
# Appendix B: Random Encounters
Random encounters can occur in Port Nyanzaru, in the wilds of Chult, and in Omu. Such encounters add mystery and atmosphere to the adventure, even as they increase tension by winnowing away at the party's resources. Random encounters are best used whenever there's a lull in the game session or when your players seem restless. No more than one or two per session is recommended, since overusing random encounters can bog down the adventure and cause the players to lose track of the story.

## Port Nyanzaru Encounters
Port Nyanzaru has a lot going on even without random encounters, but if the characters spend time exploring the city, a few random incidents can help bring that experience to life. Roll a d20 three times per day of game time, checking for encounters each morning, afternoon, and evening or night. An encounter occurs on a roll of 16 or higher. Roll a d20 and check the Port Nyanzaru Encounters table to determine what the characters encounter, or simply choose an encounter you like.

##### Port Nyanzaru Encounters
| d20 | Encounter |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A parrot poops on a random character's head. |
| 2 | Near the harbor, an **ankylosaurus** that tows boats through the warehouse canals goes on a rampage and must be calmed, restrained, or killed. |
| 3 | A merchant shouts, "Stop! Thief!" as a furtive youngster (**commoner**) rushes past the characters. If the thief is caught, the grateful merchant can introduce characters to a merchant prince or provide them one other favor. |
| 4 | A drunk foreign sailor (unarmored **veteran**) is loudly trying to pick a fight with three local **commoners**, who are clearly no match for the lout. If the characters intervene, the grateful locals become a reliable source of information about Port Nyanzaru, but the sailor and his shipmates ambush the characters elsewhere in the city later on. |
| 5 | A beggar (**commoner**) grabs a character by the arm and shouts, "The ancient one beneath the Forbidden City gives birth to a terrible new god! The snake-men know! They know!" Then he stumbles away into the crowd. Passersby tell the adventurers to ignore the beggar, and that his predictions are wrong most of the time. |
| 6 | Alarm horns declare that undead are attacking Malar's Throat. Mercenaries keep the monsters out of the city proper, but people are trapped in the temple of Tymora and besieged by 2d6 **zombies** and 2d6 **skeletons** led by a **ghoul**. If the characters defeat the undead, the temple rewards them with 5 gallons of tej and a *potion of healing*. |
| 7 | Shouts of "Look out!" give a character a brief warning as a water barrel, building stone, or other heavy weight crashes down. The character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be struck, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a disguised **yuan-ti pureblood** slinking away from the scene. |
| 8 | A **tabaxi minstrel** asks one of the characters for a gold piece to stake her for gambling, promising to pay it back. If the character agrees, the tabaxi makes good on her promise the next day, returning a pouch containing 10 gp. |
| 9 | A thief (**spy**) tries to pick the pocket of one of the characters. |
| 10 | The characters run into **Volothamp Geddarm**, who is delivering a copy of his new book to one of the city's merchant princes. There is a 50 percent chance that Volo is drunk. |
| 11-20 | The characters meet an NPC with a side quest |

## Wilderness Encounters
While the characters are exploring or camping in the wilderness, roll a d20 three times per day of game time, checking for encounters each morning, afternoon, and evening or night. An encounter occurs on a roll of 16 or higher. Roll percentile dice and check the Wilderness Encounters table for the terrain appropriate to where the characters are. After determining what the characters encounter, you can use the information presented later in this appendix to bring the encounter to life.

The maps of Chult have regions marked as undead territory (lesser or greater). The Wilderness Encounters table has separate columns you should use when determining encounters in these undead-infested regions, or in regions with no undead.

If your players tire of random encounters, make such encounters less common by having them occur on a roll of 18 or higher, or only 20. You can also let the players narrate their way through avoiding easy encounters, or you can increase the difficulty of easy encounters to keep them exciting. One way to make an encounter more challenging is to have it trigger a second random encounter. For example, a fight with goblins might attract a nearby pack of ghouls or dinosaurs. You can also shorten encounters by having monsters flee when they lose the tactical advantage or most of their hit points.

Random encounters aren't tailored to characters of a particular level. If the characters encounter hostile creatures beyond their ability to defeat, give them opportunities to run, hide, negotiate, or otherwise avoid certain death. You can also have other creatures arrive and provide a distraction that the characters can use to make their escape. For example, if a character needs to make a crucial ability check or saving throw, you can have a **chwinga** appear, cast *guidance* or *resistance* on the character, and then disappear on its next turn.

#### Aarakocra
Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher spots 1d4+1 **aarakocra** flying overhead. These creatures are scouts from Kir Sabal or another aerie. They observe the party from a safe distance but don't approach unless the characters demonstrate peaceful intentions. The bird folk are friendly and can point characters in the direction of nearby landmarks.

#### Albino Dwarves
The characters are ambushed by 1d4+3 **albino dwarf warriors** that attack from hidden burrows. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher spots the dwarves, but all others are surprised. The dwarves knock characters out rather than killing them, stealing food, water, and gear from those rendered unconscious. They break off their attack if any character speaks Dwarvish to them or demonstrates peaceful intentions.

#### Aldani
The characters are shadowed by 1d4 **aldani**, which are noticed by any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher. The aldani don't communicate with others unless they must, and they won't fight unless the characters refuse to take a bribe to leave the area. The aldani will aid the characters only if they're offered something of great value in return-for example, an offer to drive off a pack of predatory dinosaurs encroaching on their territory.

#### Almiraj
Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher spots 1d6 **almiraj** 60 feet away. The almiraj run from any creature that they can see within 30 feet of them. Any character who successfully traps an almiraj can use an action to make a DC 14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. If the check succeeds, the almiraj becomes calm and doesn't attack the character or run away unless it feels threatened or is harmed.

#### Apes
The characters stumble upon 2d4 **apes** enjoying some excellent fruit. The apes feel threatened and show signs of defending their food. If the characters immediately back away slowly, the apes do nothing but make threatening displays. Otherwise, they attack.

#### Artus Cimber
**Artus Cimber** (with or without his saurial traveling companion, **Dragonbait**) can be encountered almost anywhere. See appendix D for more information on these NPCs. The characters might stumble into Artus's camp in the evening, or he might walk into theirs. They could find him at the camp of another group of explorers, or telling a story to **Dragonbait**. He could appear out of nowhere and use the powers of the *Ring of Winter* to help characters caught up in a tough encounter.

#### Assassin Vines
The characters unwittingly enter the hunting grounds of 1d3 **assassin vines**. The vines are indistinguishable from normal plants and can't be spotted with Wisdom (Perception) checks. However, they draw carrion to their roots, so characters might smell a dead body nearby. Because assassin vines can move, an encounter in the evening or at night might involve the vines creeping into the characters' camp and strangling them as they sleep.

#### Axe Beaks
A flock of 1d6+3 **axe beaks** stampede through the characters. The characters can hear the birds charging toward them but can't see anything through the thick undergrowth until the axe beaks burst forth and attack, slashing at anyone they can reach.

#### Baboons
A pack of 3d6 **baboons** take umbrage at the characters' intrusion. The baboons can be distracted by tossing each of them a day's supply of food. Otherwise, they attack.

#### Cache
The party finds a cache of supplies left behind by other explorers. There's no way to tell from the cache whether those who left it are still alive and coming back for it, or dead. Roll a d20 and consult the Caches table to determine what the characters find.

##### Cache
| d20 | Cache |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Rain Catcher and Mess Kit |
| 2 | 10x Preserved Rations, 1 Day |
| 3 | 20x Preserved Rations, 1 Day |

| 8 | 2d4 Vial of Antitoxin |
| 9 | Insect Repellant (20 day supply) |
| 10 | 1d4x Quiver each containing and 1d20x Arrows |
| 11 | Canoe with six paddles |
| 12 | 2x Hooded Lantern and 10x Oil, Flask |
| 13 | Two Person Tent and 1d4x Explorer's Pack |
| 14 | 2d10x Low Quality Daggers |
| 15 | A set of Navigator's Tools |
| 16 | 1d10x Changes of Woolen clothing |
| 17 | A set of Cartographer's Tools |
| 18 | Two person Tent and 1d4x Healer's Kit |
| 19 | 2x Tent, Folding Camp Table, and 4x Camp Stool |
| 20 | 2d4x Potion of Healing |

#### Cannibals
Chultan cannibals prowl the jungles in small groups, killing and eating zombies while avoiding faster, more dangerous undead. Abandoned by their gods, the cannibals have turned to the worship of Dendar the Night Serpent and pay tribute to **Ras Nsi** in exchange for his favor and protection. They paint a blue triangle (**Ras Nsi**'s symbol) on their foreheads as proof of their devotion and are known to venture into Omu to hunt and deliver tribute.

If this encounter occurs during the day, the characters spot 3d6 **tribal warriors** feeding on the rotting remains of a dismembered zombie. If the characters remain quiet and keep their distance, they can move away without being noticed by the cannibals.

If this encounter occurs at night, 3d6 **tribal warriors** try to sneak into the adventurers' camp and murder them. Any character on guard is warned of the attack with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### Chwinga
A **chwinga** takes an interest in the characters. It attempts to steal something valuable from an unguarded pack or canoe, but is noticed by any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher. The chwinga always leaves something else in exchange: a pretty shell, a handful of nuts, or an uncut gemstone (10 gp).

#### Crocodiles
Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher sees and hears 1d4+1 **crocodiles** moments before they attack; all other characters are surprised. A crocodile can capsize a canoe and throw its occupants into the water by using its action and succeeding on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Cyclops
A **cyclops** is journeying toward its home near Snapping Turtle Bay. It isn't looking for a fight, but any sudden moves or hostility from the characters might trigger one. The cyclops knows the region around Lake Luo and the western end of the Valley of Dread quite well, and it's never seen anything like Omu in those areas.

Roll twice on the Treasure Drops table to see what treasure, if any, the cyclops has.

##### Treasure Drops

#### Dinosaurs
Encounters with "honkers" are common in Chult, though not all such creatures are hostile.

***Allosaurus.***  The party's scent attracts 1d3 **allosauruses**, which appear 100 yards away when the characters first notice them. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check can find a safe refuge (a high branch, a small crevice, a hollow log, and so forth) that the predators can't reach or enter.

***Ankylosaurus.***  An ornery **ankylosaurus** is gorging on plants, but it attacks any characters who disturb it.

***Brontosaurus.***  A lone **brontosaurus** lumbers toward the characters, oblivious to their presence. Though it might step on characters who don't get out of its way, it fights only in self-defense.

***Deinonychus.***  A wild **boar** races across the party's path, followed closely by a hunting pack of 1d4+2 **deinonychuses**. The predators decide the characters are more interesting prey.

***Dimetrodon.***  A pack of 2d6 **dimetrodons** are spotted along a sunny riverbank or on rocks above the water. Roll any die. On an odd result, the dimetrodons take no notice of the characters; on an even result, they're hungry and attack at the slightest provocation, or if the characters approach within 100 feet of them.

***Hadrosaurus.***  A herd of 3d6 **hadrosauruses** are grazing nearby, with 1d6 noncombatant young among them. The adults don't attack unless they're attacked or antagonized. The young are Small beasts that can be sold to **Ifan Talro'a** in Port Nyanzaru for 50 gp each, or for 100 gp if a character succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to negotiate the price. The young dinosaurs are easy to handle if separated from their parents, but the adults fight if their young are captured.

***Plesiosaurus.***  Two **plesiosauruses** are fighting over a dead giant octopus. If the characters are on a river, the creatures are spotted at a distance of 300 feet, whereupon they bellow menacingly and move to attack the party. To paddle a canoe to a safe spot along the riverbank, one character in the canoe must succeed on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check, with other characters in the canoe using the Help action. Canoes that don't reach the bank are flipped and demolished by the reptiles, which then attack swimmers in the water.

***Pteranodon.***  A flock of 2d6 **pteranodons** is spotted overhead. They keep their distance and attack only if threatened.

***Quetzalcoatlus.***  A flight of 1d4+1 **quetzalcoatluses** is spotted overhead. They keep their distance and attack only if threatened.

***Stegosaurus.***  This lone **stegosaurus** is in a genial mood. It approaches the characters out of curiosity, but anyone who touches it triggers a swipe from its tail.

***Triceratops.***  A **triceratops** that appears to be grazing alone is actually a mother with a nearby nest containing one noncombatant hatchling and two unhatched eggs. The mother eyes the characters suspiciously but doesn't attack unless they position themselves between her and the nest. **Ifan Talro'a** in Port Nyanzaru offers 50 gp for an intact triceratops egg or hatchling, or a character can talk him up to 150 gp with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

***Tyrannosaurus.***  The characters spot a **tyrannosaurus rex** 300 yards away. There's a 50 percent chance that the hungry behemoth is fighting either a stegosaurus, a triceratops, a pair of giant constrictor snakes, a giant ape, or a mob of ghouls and zombies. None of these creatures will voluntarily team up with the party, but their presence might weaken the tyrannosaurus to the point where the characters have a chance of slaying it.

Characters can avoid an encounter with the tyrannosaurus if they keep their distance and succeed on a DC 15 group Dexterity (Stealth) check. If any character is trained in the Survival skill, all the characters' checks are made with advantage.

***Velociraptor.***  A pack of 3d6 **velociraptors** burst out from behind cover and attack. Make a single Dexterity (Stealth) check for the dinosaurs, with advantage. Any character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score equals or exceeds the velociraptors' check result is not surprised.

#### Dragon, Faerie
An invisible green **faerie dragon** takes an interest in the adventurers and follows them for a while. If the characters are in good spirits, the tiny dragon plays harmless pranks on them during the party's next short or long rest. If the characters are not angered by this trickery, the dragon appears and truthfully answers three of their questions before bidding the party farewell. If the characters seem dour or mean, or if the faerie dragon's pranks sour them, it flutters off without providing any sort of aid.

The faerie dragon visited Omu recently and knows about the evil gargoyles and "snake people" that watch over the city. It also knows things about other nearby landmarks or locations, as you determine.

#### Dragon, Red
If the characters are within 50 miles of Wyrmheart Mine (see chapter 2), they see the **young red dragon** known as Tzindelor or Tinder circling over that location. If they're farther away, they see her flying in the direction of the mine. The dragon ignores the characters unless they do something to attract her attention.

#### Eblis
If the characters are on the move when this encounter occurs, they stumble across 1d4+1 **eblis** living in reed huts built on stilts above a swampy marsh or pond. The eblis attack wounded or weak-looking characters but offer to trade information for precious gemstones if faced with a strong, well-armed group. For 50 gp worth of gems, they point the adventurers in the direction of nearby landmarks. If the characters follow these directions, they have advantage on checks made to reach those landmarks (see *"Navigation"*). If the characters defeat the eblis and search the huts, roll three times on the Treasure Drops table to determine what, if anything, the eblis have stashed in their homes.

If this encounter occurs while the party is camped, the eblis sneak into the camp and try to drag one character away.

#### Emerald Enclave
The characters encounter a band of Emerald Enclave scouts or stumble upon one of their outposts. Choose whichever encounter works best for the circumstances and location.

***Enclave Scouts.***  The party meets 1d4+1 members of the Emerald Enclave working to rid the jungle of its undead menace. The group works with a **priest** of Mielikki, but all other members are **scouts**. If one of the adventurers has died recently, you can use this encounter to introduce a new character-either a member of the Emerald Enclave, someone the scouts have rescued, or a character who hired the scouts as guides.

The scouts are willing to trade information on an equal basis with a non-evil party. Characters can also convince the scouts to join their party for up to 3 days by succeeding on a DC 12 group Charisma (Persuasion) check. The Emerald Enclave scouts have enough food and water to nourish themselves, and each scout has an explorer's pack. The priest carries a priest's pack.

***Enclave Outpost.***  Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher spots a wooden platform in a tree. The platform is 2d6 × 5 feet above ground, and a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check is required to climb the tree. The platform is 10 feet square and sturdy enough to support six characters and their gear.

#### Explorer, Dead
Chult is strewn with the corpses and bones of those who have fallen victim to its terrors. When the characters discover one such victim, roll a d20 and consult the Dead Explorers table to determine what they find. Then roll once on the Treasure Drops table to see what, if anything, can be found on or near the remains.

##### Dead Explorers
| d20 | Remains |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The bloated corpse of a dead halfling, riddled with tiny arrows and dangling from a tree vine. (The halfling trespassed on grung sacred ground, and the corpse was hung here as a warning.) |
| 2 | The bones of an unarmored humanoid, lashed to a tree by vines. (This explorer was captured by Batiri goblins, doused in honey, and left to be devoured by hungry insects.) |
| 3 | The crushed remains of an unarmored dwarf, showing signs that she was stomped to death by a rampaging dinosaur. |
| 4 | The gnawed and charred bones of a humanoid. (This unfortunate was murdered and cannibalized by his starving, fever-crazed companions.) |
| 5 | The mangled body of a half-elf, seemingly bludgeoned to death. (She was dropped from high altitude by pterafolk.) |
| 6 | The scattered bones of a dwarf, torn to pieces before being devoured. (A hunting pack of velociraptors did the dwarf in.) |
| 7 | The swollen, purple corpse of an elf, dead only a few days ago from the bite of a poisonous snake. |
| 8 | A fresh human corpse stuffed into a hollow tree. (Girallons plan to return and devour it later.) |
| 9 | The skeleton of a humanoid seated on a folding camp stool, clutching a knife and fork in its bony hands. |
| 10 | The desiccated husk of a gnome, cocooned in giant spider webs. |
| 11 | The body of a human-from the waist up. Signs show that the explorer crawled a considerable distance after being bitten in half by a tyrannosaurus. (A Flaming Fist charter found on the corpse identifies it as Lord Onovan IV, of the Dales.) |
| 12 | A charred elf's skeleton inside a charred constrictor snake's skeleton. (Both were killed by a lightning bolt spell.) |
| 13 | The rotting body of a giant frog with the blade of a shortsword poking out its back. (If the frog is cut open, the partially digested body of a halfling is found inside.) |
| 14 | A tabaxi spread-eagled on the ground, but with its limbs and head severed from its torso and crudely stitched back on in the wrong arrangement. |
| 15 | A half-orc spiked to an enormous tree by the broken-off horn of a triceratops. |
| 16 | A gnome, spitted over a burned-out fire pit and thoroughly overcooked, but not eaten. (Goblin weapons and tools are scattered around amid velociraptor tracks.) |
| 17 | A headless humanoid, hung upside down from a tree and with six Batiri goblin spears thrust symmetrically through the body. (It was a Red Wizard, judging by the robes. The head is nowhere to be found.) |
| 18 | An elf, balanced on a tree branch 40 feet above the ground, arms and legs dangling downward. (A note pressed between the body and the branch explains that the elf climbed the tree to get away from a prowling allosaurus and was too terrified to come down.) |
| 19 | The moldering remains of a human wearing a Flaming Fist-style helmet, his legs broken. (He succumbed to a faerie dragon's euphoria breath weapon and stepped off a cliff. A companion tried to carry him back to Fort Beluarian, but the warrior died en route.) |
| 20 | A dwarf with six large holes piercing her armor and chest. (A stegosaurus caught her squarely with a swipe of its tail.) |

#### Explorers
The party runs into another band of explorers, consisting of a **mage**, a **priest**, a **scout**, and 1d6 **tribal warriors**. Roll a d6 on the table below to determine the group's situation.

##### Explorer Table
| d6 | Situation |
|:---:|---|
| 1-2 | The explorers are lost and hungry. |
| 3-4 | The explorers are in good shape but are actively hunted by firenewts, ghouls, goblins, or grungs (see the appropriate entry in this appendix). |
| 5 | The explorers are healthy and headed toward the nearest landmark, intent on exploring it. |
| 6 | The explorers are healthy and heading back to Port Nyanzaru for rest and supplies. |

#### Firenewts
A light firenewt patrol consists of 1d4 **firenewt warriors** mounted on **giant striders**. A heavy patrol consists of 2d4 **firenewt warriors** and a **firenewt warlock of Imix**, all mounted on **giant striders**. Statistics for all these creatures appear in appendix D. The firenewts always strike their final blows with the intention of knocking out enemies, who are then taken back to the creatures' cave lair to be tortured and eaten.

**Note**: Adjust numbers of Giant Striders as needed

#### Flail Snail
Characters spot the slimy trail of a **flail snail**. If they wish to follow it, a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check correctly deduces which direction the snail was traveling.

#### Flaming Fist
The soldiers of the Flaming Fist know the dangers of Chult better than most, and they don't take the wilderness lightly. A typical patrol is made up of a **knight** or **veteran** leading an **acolyte**, a **scout**, and 2d6 **guards**- and is sometimes accompanied by 1d4 **deinonychuses** trained to fight and hunt alongside their handlers. The Flaming Fist is friendly and helpful toward adventurers possessing a charter of exploration issued by Commander **Liara Portyr** of Fort Beluarian. If the party has no such document, the patrol tries to confiscate the adventurers' critical gear and advises them to replace it at Fort Beluarian-and to obtain a proper charter while they're at it.

#### Flying Monkeys
The sound of wings heralds the arrival of 3d6 **flying monkeys**, which swoop through the adventurers in a wave of grasping hands and feet. Each character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or lose a useful piece of gear to the furry thieves. If this encounter occurs near Mbala (see chapter 2), the monkeys are servants of the green hag **Nanny Pu'pu**.

These sociable creatures are curious about humanoids and have little fear of them. A flying monkey that is successfully grappled, caught in a net, or otherwise prevented from escaping can be trained to perform simple tricks by a character with proficiency in Animal Handling who spends a few hours a day working with the monkey. At the end of 1 week, the character makes a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, the flying monkey learns to perform a simple trick on command (such as fetching a specific object or dancing to music). An individual monkey can learn a maximum 1d6 tricks and can be taught one trick per week.

#### Flying Snakes
**Roll a die.** On an even result, the party encounters a single **flying snake**. On an odd result, the characters encounter 2d6 **flying snakes**. These snakes attack only when threatened. A flying snake that is successfully grappled can be stuffed in a sack or other soft container. After 1 hour of confinement, the snake settles down. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can remove a calm snake from the container without causing it to attack or fly away.

Characters can sell captured flying snakes to **Ifan Talro'a** in Port Nyanzaru. He offers 25 gp for each snake, but a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check can talk him up to 50 gp.

#### Frost Giants
The characters hear the sound of huge creatures stomping through the wilderness. If they follow the noise, they encounter a search party of three **frost giants** accompanied by 1d2 **winter wolves**. For each such encounter, there is a 20 percent chance that this is **Drufi**'s search party (see *"Hvalspyd"*).

The frost giants are concerned chiefly with locating the *Ring of Winter*, and they might help characters who can provide useful information. They immediately attack characters who withhold information, or who threaten to reveal the giants' presence to the Flaming Fist. The frost giants carry no treasure with them while they hunt.

#### Giant Boars
The characters see and hear 1d4+1 **giant boars** foraging ahead of them. Skirting around the boars to prevent them from charging requires a successful DC 12 group Dexterity (Stealth) check.

#### Giant Crocodile
Before it rises out of the water, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the **giant crocodile**. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score less than the check result is surprised when the monstrous creature attacks.

#### Giant Frogs
These 2d6 **giant frogs** have come together in hunger and try to eat everything that crosses their path. The characters have plenty of warning as the amphibians hop noisily toward them.

#### Giant Lizards
The characters encounter 1d6 **giant lizards** sunning themselves on warm rocks. The lizards pose no threat unless they're attacked, and they're too set in their ways to be trained as pack animals.

#### Giant Scorpions
Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher spots 1d3 **giant scorpions** moments before they emerge from hiding and attack. At the end of the encounter, any character damaged by a giant scorpion must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with shivering sickness (see *"Diseases"*).

#### Giant Snapping Turtle
The characters spot a **giant snapping turtle** sunning itself on the shore. The turtle attacks any character it can see within 30 feet of it.

#### Giant Wasps
A droning sound announces the presence of 1d6 **giant wasps** before the characters see them. The wasps attack at once, ignoring heavily armored targets in favor of those with little or no defensive protection. At the end of the encounter, any character damaged by a giant wasp must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with shivering sickness (see *"Diseases"*).

#### Girallons
Two **girallons** hang in the trees, perch atop rocks, or lumber between crumbling, vine-covered ruins. The characters spot them automatically and can avoid a hostile encounter if they withdraw and succeed on a DC 13 group Dexterity (Stealth) check.

If the characters defeat the girallons or frighten them away, a search of the area reveals a hidden cache, determined by rolling on the Caches table. The girallons might also have some treasure hidden near the cache; roll once on the Treasure Drops table to determine what, if anything, is found after a search of the area.

#### Goblins
A typical Batiri patrol or hunting party consists of a **goblin boss** leading 2d6+3 **goblins**, all wearing painted wooden masks. They move quietly through familiar areas and seldom range outside their home territory. Batiri prefer to hunt at night and lay low in ambush positions during the day.

A night encounter with Batiri goblins involves an attack on the characters' camp. Each party member standing watch must attempt a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check, made with disadvantage because of the noise of the jungle at night. On a success, a character detects the goblins moving into attack positions and can rouse the rest of the party. If no one on watch succeeds on the check, all the characters are surprised.

If this encounter occurs while the characters are traveling during the day, have each party member make a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check to spot the telltale signs of an ambush: disadvantageous terrain coupled with an eerie silence not normal for the jungle.

Goblins bargain for their lives if captured. If the characters can force or coerce a vow of cooperation from goblin prisoners, the Batiri will serve as guides. They have the following additional skill: Survival +1.

#### Grungs
A grung hunting party consists of 2d6 **grungs** led by a **grung elite warrior** (see appendix D for both). If this encounter occurs while the characters are traveling, the grungs have set up an ambush in the trees. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher spots them just in time. All other characters are surprised.

If this encounter occurs while the party is camped, the grungs spotted the characters earlier in the day and have shadowed them unseen. Each character standing watch must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, made with disadvantage because of the noise of the jungle at night. On a success, a character detects the encroaching grungs and can rouse the rest of the party. If no one on watch succeeds on the check, all the characters are surprised.

If the characters capture one or more grungs, the frogfolk offer to lead the characters to treasure in exchange for a promise of freedom. The "treasure" is a half-mile away from the party's present location and consists of a cache, which you can randomly determine by rolling on the Caches table.

#### Jaculis
Without warning, 1d6 **jaculis** launch themselves at the party from the trees. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher is able to react, but all others are surprised.

#### Kamadans
The party is ambushed by 1d2 **kamadans**. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher gets a warning of the attack, but all others are surprised. Characters who prevail against the kamadans can search the area for their lair, finding it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check.

A kamadan lair has a 25 percent chance of containing 1d3 noncombatant young the size of house cats. With their snakes not yet grown out, they look like leopard cubs. **Ifan Talro'a** in Port Nyanzaru will pay 150 gp for a live kamadan cub, but a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check talks him up to 300 gp.

##### Kamadan Cubs
| d4 | Cubs |
|:---:|---|
| 1-3 | No Cubs |
| 4 | 1d3x Kamadan Cubs |

#### Lizardfolk
The characters encounter 2d4 **lizardfolk** and a **lizardfolk shaman**. These lizardfolk belong to a tribe or kingdom in the Valley of Dread and can be appeased with food (one day's supply per lizardfolk in the group). Otherwise they attack.

#### Blue Mist
A bank of blue mist drifts toward the party, covering an area of 1d6 20-foot squares. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher notices the mist and can warn others of its approach. If the encounter occurs while the party is camped, the mist drifts through the camp at a speed of 5 feet per round. Characters who come into contact with the mist are exposed to blue mist fever (see *"Diseases"*).

#### Magmins
The characters are attacked by 2d6 **magmins**, which flee if reduced to fewer than half their starting number.

#### Mantraps
The characters blunder into a patch of 1d4+1 **mantraps**, which are undetectable until they attack. The plants are 10 feet apart, so that only one plant attacks on the first round. The others must wait until characters maneuver within 5 feet of them.

#### Mephits
The characters might encounter **magma mephits**, **mud mephits**, **smoke mephits**, or **steam mephits** (each appearing as a group of 2d6). The mephits don't attack unless they outnumber the characters two to one, but they're reluctant to be helpful unless they themselves are outnumbered.

#### Night Hag
One of the Sewn Sisters (see chapter 5) shadows the party while staying in the Border Ethereal. During the party's next long rest, the **night hag** materializes and snatches some blood or hair from a random character before returning to the Ethereal Plane.

#### Pterafolk
Looming in the sky, 1d4+2 **pterafolk** watch the characters' every move and wait until they blunder into danger. The next time a random encounter occurs, the pterafolk take advantage of the distraction and attack from the air, launching javelin attacks at wounded characters while staying out of melee. If they meet firm resistance, the pterafolk fly away, but they might regroup for a follow-up attack at your discretion.

#### Rare Plant(s)
The characters find one or more unusual plants, determined by rolling a d6 on the following table:

##### Rare Plants
| d6 | Plant |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | 2d6x Dancing Monkey fruit growing on a tree |
| 2 | 2d6x Menga Leaves from a Menga bush |
| 3 | 1d4x Ryath Roots growing in the ground |
| 4 | 4d6x Sinda Berries growing on a bush |
| 5 | 2d6x Wukka Nuts growing on a Wukka tree |
| 6 | 1d6x Zabou on a dead tree |

#### Red Wizard
This group consists of a Red Wizard (LE male or female Thayan human **mage**), 1d6 **guards**, and 1d6 **skeletons**, all answerable to **Valindra Shadowmantle** (see "Heart of Ubtao,"). If this encounter occurs outside of Omu, these reinforcements are on their way to the city. If the encounter takes place in Omu, the Red Wizard is searching the city for shrines (see chapter 3). The Thayans aren't spoiling for a fight; if defeat seems inevitable, the Red Wizard surrenders and offers a crude map of Chult marking the regions occupied by undead (see map 2.1). The characters can use the map to steer clear of these regions.

#### Salamander
The characters see a **salamander** tending a nest of 1d6 **fire snakes**. The salamander has no interest in fighting and attacks only to protect itself and the snakes.

#### Sea Hags
The characters encounter three **sea hags** that comprise a coven. Their favorite trick is to pull a damaged or abandoned canoe onto a riverbank and pretend to be stranded or wounded explorers in need of rescue.

If the characters defeat the sea hags and search the area, roll three times on the Treasure Drops table to determine what, if anything, they find. Whatever treasure the hags have is stowed inside a rotted wooden chest.

#### Shambling Mound
Roll any die when a **shambling mound** encounter occurs. On an even result, the characters hear the creature trudging through the muck before it attacks them. On an odd result, the shambling mound lurks within a mass of vegetation, where it can be noticed by any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher.

#### Snake, Constrictor
A **constrictor snake** attacks a random party member from hiding. The character targeted by the snake is surprised unless he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher.

#### Snake, Giant Constrictor
A **giant constrictor snake** attacks from hiding in the same manner as a constrictor snake.

#### Snake, Giant Poisonous
A **giant poisonous snake** shoots out from the undergrowth to attack a random character. The character targeted by the snake is surprised unless he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher.

#### Spiders
Giant spider webs are easily concealed in Chult's dense jungles and swamps. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher spots the webs in time to alert the other characters to an encounter with 1d6 **giant spiders**. Otherwise, the spiders attack with surprise when the lead party member blunders into a sticky web and becomes grappled by it (escape DC 12). Hundreds of baby giant spiders crawl through the webs, but they are harmless.

#### Statue of Ubtao
Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher spots a 10-foot-tall statue overgrown with vines. The statue depicts a stylized Chultan king—a representation of Ubtao. Roll a d4 to determine what's special about the statue:

##### Statue of Ubtao
| d4 | Result |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | 1x Treasure Drops |
| 2 | Skulls |
| 3 | Glyph of Warding |
| 4 | Find the Path Charm |

**1.** Treasure lies at the foot of the statue, left there as tribute by some jungle creature. Roll once on the Treasure Drops table to determine what treasure is found. If the roll indicates no treasure, the characters find worthless pieces of bone jewelry instead.

**2.** Goblin, grung, and su-monster skulls are piled around the statue's base.

**3.** A *glyph of warding* is inscribed on the statue. To spot the glyph, a character searching the statue must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If any creature touches the statue, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the statue. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The thunderous noise has a 75 percent chance of attracting stirges or a troll lurking nearby (see "Stirges" and "Troll" below).

**4.** The statue has grooves carved into its stomach that form a maze. Any character who studies the grooves and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence check sees a clear pathway through the labyrinth. That character is then bestowed with the power to cast the *find the path* spell as an action, no components required, by tracing the same path with his or her finger. Once used, this ability goes away. Once the statue has granted this benefit, it can't do so again until the next dawn.

#### Stirges
Chult is rich in caves, ruins, and hollow logs in which stirges can hide. By day, the characters disturb 2d6 **stirges** as they move through the jungle. At night, the same number of stirges descend on the party's camp.

#### Su-monsters
The party comes across 1d4+1 **su-monsters**. The su-monsters approach cautiously, feigning curiosity. If allowed to get close, each su-monster uses its Psychic Crush in the hope of stunning an adventurer before attacking with its bite and claws. The su-monsters flee to their treetop lairs if the fight goes against them.

The su-monsters might have treasure stashed in one of their trees; roll once on the Treasure Drops table to determine what, if anything, a search of the tree yields.

#### Swarms of Bats
Ruins, hollow trees, and hidden caverns can all be homes to bats. This encounter sees the characters disturb 1d4 **swarms of bats** that have become unnaturally aggressive from feeding on undead flesh.

#### Swarms of Insects
The characters are beset by 1d4 **swarm of insects (centipedes)**. At the end of the encounter, any character damaged by a swarm must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with shivering sickness (see *"Diseases"*).

#### Swarms of Quippers
This encounter indicates that 1d4 **swarms of quippers** catch sight of the party, but these creatures are dangerous only if the characters are in the water with them. Creatures on the shore or in canoes are safe, but in both cases, the swarms follow the characters until they're out of sight and away from the water.

#### Tabaxi Hunter
Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher spots a **tabaxi hunter** watching the party from a vantage point 300 feet away. If the tabaxi goes unseen, it might shadow the characters for a while, then suddenly appear to help them fight off a tough encounter or warn them of danger in the vicinity.

If this encounter takes place in Omu, see chapter 3 for more information on the tabaxi hunters found there.

#### Tiger
A **tiger** lies in wait for the party but is noticed by any character whose passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 16 or higher. If not detected, the tiger pounces at a character who comes within 40 feet of it. The tiger retreats if it loses more than half its hit points.

#### Tri-flower Frond
If this encounter occurs while the characters are traveling, they wander into a patch of 1d4 **tri-flower fronds** which seem like ordinary plants until they strike. If the encounter occurs while the party is camped, the plants try to infiltrate the camp, anesthetize characters with their orange blossoms, then slay them with their yellow and red blossoms.

#### Troll
A hungry **troll** comes crashing out of the jungle, intent on eating the characters.

#### Undead
Undead are spreading through the jungles of Chult like a plague. The Emerald Enclave, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Flaming Fist are all taking steps to contain this menace, but their efforts to date have fallen short.

***Ghouls.***  Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher hears and smells a ghoul pack approaching, consisting of 2d6 **ghouls** led by a **ghast**. The ghast has a blue triangle tattooed on its forehead-an indicator that it once served **Ras Nsi**.

***Skeletons.***  The characters come across 3d6 **skeletons**. If the encounter occurs while the party is traveling, the skeletons are either lying on the ground or buried under it, ready to spring up when wayward explorers pass by. If the party is camped, the skeletons wander into the camp and attack.

***Specter.***  The evil remnant of a dead explorer has become a **specter** that attacks the party. The explorer's body can be found with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check. If the characters locate the body, see "Explorer, Dead" earlier in this section to determine what they find.

***Wight.***  The characters encounter a **wight** that has lurked in the Chultan jungle since before the Spellplague. It harbors an eternal hatred for Chultans and everything related to Ubtao. If the party includes any Chultans or any character wearing the holy symbol of Ubtao, the wight attacks those characters in preference to other targets.

***Zombies.*** Characters catch the scent of death on the air and hear the undead lumbering through the jungle.

Roll on the table below to determine what appears:

##### Zombies
| d10 | Zombies Appearing |
|:---:|---|
| 1-3 | 3d6 **Zombies** |
| 4-5 | 1 **Ankylosaurus Zombie** |
| 6-7 | 1d4 **Girallon Zombies** |
| 8-9 | 1d4 **Ogre Zombies** |
| 10 | 1 **Tyrannosaurus Zombie** |

#### Vegepygmies
The characters cross paths with 1d4 **vegepygmies**, each one mounted on a **thorny** (see appendix D for both). These vegepygmy hunters have wandered far from their tribe. They flee if outnumbered; otherwise, they attack.

#### Wereboar
A **wereboar** masquerading as a Chultan priest takes a dim view of explorers encroaching on its territory and demands that the characters turn back. Around its neck, it wears a wooden holy symbol of Ubtao (a labyrinthine pattern carved into a circular disk). The wereboar might be guarding a shrine to Ubtao, a grove of wukka trees, or a cave it uses as a lair. The creature might also have treasure in its lair; roll three times on the Treasure Drops table to determine what, if anything, a search of the wereboar's lair yields.

#### Weretiger
A **weretiger** in human form offers to escort the party through a particularly dangerous stretch of wilderness. It has no ulterior motive and doesn't ask for payment. If the characters accept its assistance, they have no hostile random encounters while the weretiger is with them. It leaves after accompanying the party for 24 hours or when it reaches a location it does not wish to explore, including Omu, Nangalore, or Orolunga.

#### Winterscape
The characters stumble into a wondrous sight: a 120-foot-radius sphere of winter weather. To drive off some monsters, **Artus Cimber** created the sphere using the *Ring of Winter*. All plants and surfaces within the sphere are covered with glittering ice and frost, and the temperature within the sphere is a biting -30 degrees Fahrenheit. The effect was created by an artifact and can't be dispelled.

#### Yellow Musk Creeper and Zombies
The characters pass close to a ruin inhabited by 3d6 **yellow musk zombies**. The zombies might be spread across the area or bunched together, depending on the terrain. In the heart of the ruin, a **yellow musk creeper** clings to a crumbling archway, statue, or polluted well.

If this encounter occurs while the party is camped, the zombies emerge from a nearby ruin to attack the camp and attempt to knock characters unconscious. They then drag those characters back to the yellow musk creeper.

#### Yuan-Ti
Yuan-ti patrols consist of 1d6+1 **yuan-ti purebloods**, which keep their distance as they try to gather information to take back to **Ras Nsi**. The yuan-ti are camouflaged, but any character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check made with disadvantage catches sight of the serpent folk as they withdraw.

If this encounter occurs within 25 miles of Omu, the patrol is instead made up of 1d4 **yuan-ti malisons**, and it takes a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot them. If the characters chase after the malisons, they transform into snakes and vanish into the jungle.

#### Zhentarim
A Zhent **assassin** with a **flying snake** pet leads a **priest**, 2d6 **thugs**, and 1d6 **tribal warriors** through the wilderness in search of **Artus Cimber** and the *Ring of Winter*. If Artus is with the characters, the Zhents demand the ring and attack if they don't receive it quickly. Otherwise, they show little interest in the characters.

Roll once on the Treasure Drops table to determine what treasure, if any, the Zhents carry.

#### Zorbos
If this encounter occurs while the characters are traveling, they spot 2d6 **zorbos** in wukka trees. The creatures growl and bare their teeth if any characters approach them. If the characters act in a threatening manner, the zorbos attack.

If this encounter occurs while the party is camped, the hungry zorbos drop from the surrounding trees and attack.

## Omu Encounters
Random encounters in Omu can take place in ruined buildings and streets, in the fetid swamps around the buildings, and in the ruined royal palace. Roll a d20 three times per day of game time, checking for encounters each morning, afternoon, and evening or night. An encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher. Roll percentile dice and check the Omu Encounters table for the appropriate terrain to see what the characters encounter.

Four random encounters that occur only in Omu are described below.

#### Gargoyles
Perched on a cliff are 2d4 **gargoyles** that swoop down to attack. Two of them carry a net between them. As an action, either gargoyle can use the net to make a melee weapon attack (+4 to hit) against one Small or Medium creature. If the attack hits, the gargoyles hoist the character into the air and fly off with their catch. It takes both gargoyles to lift the net if it has a creature caught in it. The gargoyles flee if reduced to half their number.

#### Giant Wolf Spiders
The characters are attacked by 1d6 **giant wolf spiders** living in hidey-holes in the nearby ruins. A search of the spiders' lair might yield treasure; roll once on the Treasure Drops table to determine what, if anything, is found.

#### King of Feathers
The characters encounter the tyrannosaurus rex known as the **King of Feathers**. See chapter 3 for more information on this unique beast.

#### Kobolds
Moving through the city or palace ruins are 1d4+1 **kobolds** led by a **kobold inventor**. Characters with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher spot the kobolds, which flee if approached or attacked. The kobolds serve the kobold scale sorcerer Kakarol (see chapter 3). They might be on their way to one of the city's shrines to reset its traps, or they might be returning to their lair with a recently discovered treasure. Roll once on the Treasure Drops table to determine what, if anything, the kobolds found.

# Appendix C: Discoveries
Chult is a land filled with untold wonders and lost treasures. Adventurers will discover this for themselves as they explore the peninsula's uncharted wilderness.

### Flora and Fauna
This section describes unusual wildlife native to Chult. Any character with proficiency in the Nature skill recognizes one of these plants or creatures on sight, and can recall its properties with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. If the character is a native of Chult, this check is made with advantage.

The wildlife described here can be bought and sold in Port Nyanzaru and other settlements for the amounts listed in the Flora and Fauna table.

Some of these things inflict the poisoned condition on a creature for an hour or more. Remember that *lesser restoration* and similar magic can end that condition.

##### Flora and Fauna
| Item | Cost |
|---|---:|
| Dancing monkey fruit | 5 gp |
| Menga leaves (1 ounce) | 2 gp |
| Ryath root | 50 gp |
| Sinda berries (10) | 5 gp |
| Wildroot | 25 gp |
| Wukka nut | 1 gp |
| Yahcha | 1 gp |
| Zabou | 10 gp |

#### Dancing Monkey Fruit
This rare magical fruit produces enough juice to fill a vial. Any humanoid that eats a dancing monkey fruit or drinks its juice must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or begin a comic dance that lasts for 1 minute. Humanoids that can't be poisoned are immune to this magical effect.

The dancer must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. Each time it takes damage, the dancer can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. When the dancing effect ends, the humanoid suffers the poisoned condition for 1 hour.

#### Menga Leaves
The dried leaves of a menga bush can be ground, dissolved in a liquid, heated, and ingested. A creature that ingests 1 ounce of menga leaves in this fashion regains 1 hit point. A creature that ingests more than 5 ounces of menga leaves in a 24-hour period gains no additional benefit and must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 hour. The unconscious creature awakens if it takes at least 5 damage on one turn.

A healthy menga bush usually has 2d6 ounces of leaves. Once picked, the leaves require 1 day to dry out before they can confer any benefit.

#### Ryath Root
Any creature that ingests a ryath root gains 2d4 temporary hit points. A creature that consumes more than one ryath root in a 24-hour period must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the poisoned condition for 1 hour.

#### Sinda Berries
These berries are dark brown and bitter. A full-grown sinda berry bush has 4d6 berries growing on it. A bush plucked of all its berries grows new berries in 1d4 months. Picked berries lose their freshness and efficacy after 24 hours.

Fresh sinda berries can be eaten raw or crushed and added to a drink to dull the bitterness. A creature that consumes at least ten fresh sinda berries gains advantage on saving throws against disease and poison for the next 24 hours.

#### Wildroot
Introducing the juice of a wildroot into a poisoned creature's bloodstream (for example, by rubbing it on an open wound) rids the creature of the poisoned condition. Once used in this way, a wildroot loses this property.

#### Wukka Nuts
These fist-sized nuts grow on wukka trees, which are popular haunts for jaculi, su-monsters, and zorbos. A wukka nut rattles when shaken, causing its shell to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. This magical light fades after 1 minute, but shaking the nut again causes the light to reappear. If the shell of the nut is cracked open, it loses its magic.

#### Yahcha
A yahcha (pronounced YAH-chah) is a harmless, meaty beetle about the size of a human hand, which feeds on worms and maggots. It moves slowly (walking speed 10 feet) and is easy to catch. A creature with blue mist fever that eats a raw or cooked yahcha can immediately make a saving throw with advantage against that disease (see *"Diseases,"*).

#### Zabou
Zabou mushrooms feed on offal and the rotting wood of dead trees. If handled carefully, a zabou can be picked or uprooted without causing it to release its spores. If crushed or struck, a zabou releases its spores in a 10-foot-radius sphere. A zabou can also be hurled up to 30 feet away or dropped like a grenade, releasing its cloud of spores on impact. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature's skin itches for the duration. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- *Amulet of the Black Skull*
- *Bookmark*
