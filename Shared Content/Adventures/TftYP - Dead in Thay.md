# Preface
Welcome to *Tales from the Yawning Portal*. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.

Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.

- A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.
- A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.
- A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.

These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerûn and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.

The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.

### Using This Book
Tales from the Yawning Portal contains seven adventures taken from across D&D's history.

The introduction of each adventure provides ideas on adapting it to a variety of D&D settings. Use that information to place it in your campaign or to give you an idea of how to adapt it.

These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as *Storm King's Thunder*, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.

### About the Adventures

#### The Sunless Citadel
*The Sunless Citadel,* written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.

Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Citadel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. It's also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.

#### The Forge of Fury
*The Forge of Fury,* written by Richard Baker, was published in 2000 shortly after The Sunless Citadel. Characters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a ruined dwarven fortress.

Like its predecessor, *The Forge of Fury* is tailored to provide increasingly tougher threats as the characters make their way through the fortress. Those who survive the experience can expect to advance to 5th level-seasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory and renown.

#### The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan
*The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,* written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title *Lost Tamoachan* at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.

The updated version of the adventure presented herein is designed for a group of four or five 5th-level player characters.

#### White Plume Mountain
Lawrence Schick, the author of *White Plume Mountain*, related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he get the job, but *White Plume* became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.

The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.

#### Dead in Thay
*Dead in Thay,* written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was created when the fifth edition D&D game was in the testing stages. In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to *Tomb of Horrors, Ruins of Undermountain*, and other "killer dungeons" throughout the history of the game.

The version of *Dead in Thay* presented here is modified for use in home campaigns. It is designed for characters of 9th to 11th level.

#### Against the Giants
The three linked adventures that make up *Against the Giants* were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the *Player's Handbook* for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.

The compilation of *Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl*, and *Hall of the Fire Giant King* was published in 1981 as *Against the Giants*. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.

#### Tomb of Horrors
Before there was much of anything else in the world of the D&D game, there was the *Tomb of Horrors*.

The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of *Tomb of Horrors*, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.

As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.

### Running the Adventures
To run each of these adventures, you need the fifth edition *Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*. Before you sit down with your players, read the text of the adventure all the way through and familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps making notes about complex areas or places where the characters are certain to go, so you're well prepared before the action starts.

>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
>

The *Monster Manual* contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in appendix B. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure's text tells you so.

Spells and nonmagical objects or equipment mentioned in the book are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, unless the adventure's text directs you to an item's description in appendix A.

### Creating a Campaign
While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaign-over 30 years separates the newest from the oldest-they have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.

Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.

The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.

### The Yawning Portal
Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.

In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.

For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.

All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.

Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.

Adventurers from across Faerûn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.

#### The Green Dragon Inn
The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.

### Features of the Yawning Portal
The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The "well" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.

Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.

#### Entering the Well
Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to "ride the rope") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.

#### Oddities on Display
A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.

#### A Typical Evening
On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.

Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.

### Starting the Story
Kicking off a dungeon adventure can be as simple as having a mysterious stranger offer the characters a quest while they are at the Yawning Portal (or some other tavern). This approach is a cliché, but it is an effective one. Use the following two tables to generate a couple of details, then tailor the particulars of the quest and the quest giver to suit the adventure you plan to run.

##### Mysterious Stranger Quest
| d8 | Objective |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Recover a particular item |
| 2 | Find and return with an NPC or monster |
| 3 | Slay a terrible monster or NPC |
| 4 | Guard a person while they perform a ritual |
| 5 | Create an accurate map of part of the dungeon |
| 6 | Discover secret lore hidden in the dungeon |
| 7 | Destroy an object |
| 8 | Sanctify part of the dungeon to a god of good |

##### Mysterious Stranger Secret
| d8 | Secret |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Intends to betray the party |
| 2 | Unwittingly provides false information |
| 3 | Has a secret agenda (roll another quest) |
| 4 | Is a devil in disguise |
| 5 | Has led other parties to their doom |
| 6 | Is the charmed thrall of a mind flayer |
| 7 | Is possessed by a ghost |
| 8 | Is a solar in disguise |

#### Durnan
The proprietor of the Yawning Portal is something of an enigma. Blessed with a seemingly limitless life span by treasures he brought back from his expedition nearly two centuries ago, he is as much a fixture in the tap room as the well.

Durnan is a man of few words. He expects to be paid for his time, and will offer insight and rumors only in return for hard cash. "We know the odds and take our chances," he says, whether he is breaking up a card game that has turned violent or refusing the pleas of adventurers trapped at the bottom of the well who are unable to pay for a ride up. Despite his stony heart, he is an excellent source of information about Undermountain and other dungeons, provided one can pay his price.

![[Durnan.jpg|right|300]]

***Personality Trait: Isolation.*** It's a cruel world. All people have to fend for themselves. Self-sufficiency is the only path to success.

***Ideal: Independence.*** Someone who can stand alone can stand against anything.

***Bond: The Yawning Portal.*** This place is my only home. My friends and family are long gone. I love this place, but I try not to get attached to the people here. I'll outlive them all. Lucky me.

***Flaw: Heartless.*** If you want sympathy, the Temple of Ilmater is in the Sea Ward. No matter how bad things are, you'll be gone in a blink of an eye.

#### Other Denizens
The Yawning Portal is host to a variety of regular visitors, most of whom offer services to adventurers. Chapter 4 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* provides plenty of resources for generating nonplayer characters. The following table provides some possibilities for why an individual is visiting the Yawning Portal.

##### Denizens
| d10 | Denizen |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Devotee of Tymora, encourages adventures to seek out quests, can cast bless |
| 2 | Bored, retired adventurer, claims to have explored dungeon of note and can describe first few areas (20 percent chance of an accurate description) |
| 3 | Heckler, mocks cowards and makes bets that adventurers won't return from an expedition |
| 4 | Con artist, selling fake treasure maps (but a 10 percent chance that a map is genuine) |
| 5 | Wizard's apprentice, carefully making exact sketches of various curios at her master's command |
| 6 | Spouse of a slain adventurer, who pays the toll for anyone wanting to exit Undermountain and plots against Durnan |
| 7 | Zhentarim agent, seeks rumors of treasure, tails any folk who return from Undermountain and notes their home base for future robbery |
| 8 | Agent of the Xanathar, ordered to "steal the hat worn by the eighth person to enter the taproom this night" |
| 9 | Magically preserved corpse in a coffin leaning against the bar; if asked about it, Durnan says, "He's waiting for someone," and nothing more |
| 10 | Elminster, incognito; 10 percent chance he is on an errand of cosmic importance; otherwise, he's pressing Durnan for gossip |

# Dead in Thay
Near the village of Daggerford on the Sword Coast, the Red Wizards of Thay plotted to extend the evil reach of their land and its master, the lich lord Szass Tam. At a site called Bloodgate Keep they built a powerful portal, fueled by elemental nodes, that could allow Thayans to instantly transport whole armies into the very heart of the Sword Coast. With this power, the Red Wizards would surely overthrow and take control of the North.

However, groups of heroes recently assaulted Bloodgate Keep and its master, the lich **Tarul Var**. With the help of a renegade Red Wizard named **Mennek Ariz**, this assault was successful. Bloodgate Keep fell, and Szass Tam's plans of invasion were crushed.

What no one expected, though, was that despite the fall of the keep itself, parts of the Bloodgate Nexus (an interconnected series of teleportation circles) survived, and a Thayan Resurrection cell leader named Syranna devised a way to use it against Szass Tam. Syranna had been part of the team that originally assembled the Bloodgate Nexus, and knew that remaining nodes allowed direct access to a secret Thayan training ground known as the Doomvault.

This adventure takes place in the Doomvault. It is designed for 9th-level characters. By the end of the story, they are likely to advance to 11th level or perhaps higher... if they don't end up dead in Thay.

## Synopsis
Kazit Gul, a Thayan archmage, built the Doomvault to siphon the souls of those who perished within it for use in his dark experiments. One of these was the creation of an extradimensional vault in which he stored his phylactery. Eventually, Szass Tam and his followers defeated and enslaved Gul. They changed the Doomvault into a monstrous menagerie and arcane laboratory. Although the space is still called the Phylactery Vault of Kazit Gul, it now also holds the phylacteries of Szass Tam and all his elite lich servants.

Syranna knows that if the characters can make their way through the Doomvault and find the entrance to the phylactery vault, they could strike a deathblow to Szass Tam's hold on power. She can provide them access and a little bit of guidance, but the bulk of the work is in their hands. They must assault the Doomvault quickly—the more word gets out about their activities, the more the site's guards will be on alert.

Eventually, the characters will discover that Szass Tam is siphoning the power of members of the Chosen, mortals who have been invested with the power of the gods so as to help shape the Realms to match the will of their divine benefactors. The lich is using that power to keep the vault hidden, warp the magic fueling the Doomvault, and power his pursuit of godhood.

> ##### Placing the Adventure
>This adventure takes place in the Forgotten Realms, but it can easily be transplanted—the site and the story alike—into another setting.
>
>***Dragonlance.*** On Krynn, the Doomvault is likely to be the work of renegade wizards, perhaps of more than one color, with magic as their only alliance and moral compass. The dungeon might exist underneath a ruined Tower of High Sorcery, or it could be a haunt of Fistandantilus before his failed attempt at godhood. If it is part of ruins, it could even be the Tower of Istar, which Nuitari took at the end of the Chaos War. Or it might be the same tower, after Mina raised it and the black-robed wizards took it for their own.

>***Eberron.*** The Doomvault, lying beneath the Mournland, might be the secret project of King Kaius of Karrnath. Kaius I hid in the dungeon from the time the lich Vol made him a vampire until he returned to take the throne from his grandson. He's trying to become powerful enough to thwart Vol's influence on him and become the preeminent monarch of Khorvaire. Kaius is draining powerful dragonmarked scions instead of Chosen. Alternatively, the Doomvault could be the Blood of Vol's headquarters in Khorvaire. Vol uses the dungeon to harvest the power of dragonmarks so she can become an undead god.

>***Greyhawk.*** Perhaps Rary the Traitor found the Doomvault—yet another vestige of ancient Sulm—under the Bright Desert. Rary takes any chance to increase his power, even as he claims the desire to destroy the accursed Scorpion Crown and return Sulm to its fertile state. Since his betrayal of the Circle of Eight and the subjugation of the people of the Bright Desert, Rary has made countless enemies who want him to fail even at noble aims. If he succeeds at destroying the crown, his tyranny will still remain.

### Characters' Goals
Over the course of the adventure, the characters try to accomplish the following tasks:

- Explore the Doomvault and deal as much damage to the Thayans as possible.
- Learn how to access the Phylactery Vault, and destroy the phylacteries within it.

The villains' goals are straightforward: defend the Doomvault and kill the intruders. Not all of the characters' potential foes share these goals, so the opportunity exists to turn enemies into allies, or at least useful tools.

## The Doomvault
After the fall of Bloodgate Keep, a Red Wizard named Syranna, a leader in the Thayan Resurrection resistance movement, saw an unusual opportunity. Her knowledge of the secret portal network of which the Bloodgate was a part gave her the ability to open portals directly into the Doomvault.

The following sections contain details on the logistics of running an adventure set there. When you're familiar with these, continue with the characters' introduction to Syranna and their mission in Into The Doomvault.

### Dungeon Characteristics
Locations in the Doomvault are identified on map 5.1. The following characteristics are common to all the areas, unless otherwise noted in a specific description.

Because of Szass Tam's suspicious nature, and the existential threat that discovery of the Phylactery Vault would pose, movement within the Doomvault is regulated with what one might call excessive precautions.

#### Sectors, Zones, and Areas
The Doomvault is divided into nine sectors that each focus on a different theme. A sector is split into four zones, that each explore one facet of that theme with a number of areas detailing a particular example. Magic gates separate zones from one another.

Sectors are labeled on the map: Abyssal Prisons, Blood Pens, Masters' Domain, Far Realm Cysts, Forests of Slaughter, Ooze Grottos, Predator Pools, Golem Laboratories, and Temples of Extraction. Zones are also labeled on the map. Areas are identified by numbers.

![[001-dit01.jpg|right|300]]

#### Dimensional Barriers
Magic secures the dungeon. No spell or trait allows anyone to evade the dungeon's security. For instance, a wizard might use a *dimension door* spell to teleport from one part of a zone to another, but no spell permits teleportation out of the zone in which the spell was cast. Similarly, a wizard might cast a *passwall* spell to burrow from one area to another. If the tunnel would pass from one zone to another, circumventing security, then the tunnel ends halfway between the origin point and the possible exit point. In any case, the caster knows why the spell didn't work as intended. Further, an incorporeal or ethereal creature can't pass between zones.

A *detect magic* spell can't penetrate the structure of the Doomvault to sense the dimensional barriers.

#### Magic Gates
Two types of magic gates, white and black, secure the Doomvault. Magic keys allow the manipulation of them.

***Gate Features.*** Each gate is a 10-foot-wide circle of runes, drawn on the floor. This circle creates a magical energy field in its space from floor to ceiling. Someone who touches the edge of a gate's field can assess its nature with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The field can be disabled by the use of a glyph key (see below).

A creature that enters an active gate's energy field while not holding a properly attuned glyph key is pushed back 10 feet. The first time a creature does so on a turn, the creature takes 5 (2d4) force damage.

***White Gates.*** White gates are placed in the dungeon to block passage between zones. When the characters see a white gate for the first time, read:

>>A ten-foot-diameter circle of runes and clear quartz fragments is set into the floor. Within the circle, a luminous white mist shimmers, obscuring what lies beyond.
>>

Thereafter, you can shorten the description of the gates they encounter to avoid repetition.

A white gate's misty energy field, when active, gives off dim light and renders its area heavily obscured. This field is also an impenetrable magical force that blocks passage (material and ethereal), sound, and scent.

If a glyph key attuned to the zone on either side of the gate is applied to the gate's field, the mist dissipates and the energy field becomes inactive while the key remains within the gate. Therefore, a creature that has a properly attuned glyph key can hold a white gate open for others.

***Black Gates.*** The black gates were part of the Doomvault's original construction. They connect different areas of the complex. When the characters see a black gate for the first time, read:

>>A ten-foot-diameter circle of runes and black onyx fragments is set into the floor. It exudes wisps of shadowy energy that look like curling black smoke.
>>

Thereafter, you can shorten the description of the gates they encounter to avoid repetition.

When a black gate's magical field is active, it gives off shadowy energy that lightly obscures the field's area.

A creature can render a black gate's field inactive by holding any glyph key to the field, whereupon the smoky energy dissipates. If the key is attuned to a zone containing a different black gate, then the creature holding the key can also open a magical portal that leads to the other black gate's area. While the portal is open, the destination gate's field also becomes inactive. A black gate's field remains inactive until no glyph key is applied to it. A portal created within a black gate remains open until the creature that opened the portal leaves the area of either connected black gate.

As the adventure progresses, the characters learn that disrupting a number of black gates is essential to reaching the Phylactery Vault, where the party can upset Szass Tam's plans and loosen his grip on power in Thay. Szass Tam's channeling of Chosen life force has created instability in the black gates' magic. To reach the Phylactery Vault, six black gates must be disrupted. Once those gates are disrupted, any black gate can be forced to connect the Temples of Extraction to the Phylactery Vault, which is otherwise accessible only to Szass Tam.

Once the characters learn that they need to disrupt the gates, anyone who understands the nature of the gates knows how to perform the disruption. As an action, a character who has the glyph key attuned to a black gate's zone can disrupt the gate. To do so, the character must touch the edge of the gate's energy field and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A *dispel magic* spell cast on the gate up to 1 minute beforehand grants advantage on this check. On a failure, the character performing the check takes 7 (2d6) force damage.

Creatures patrolling the Doomvault don't notice the disruption, since a disrupted black gate continues to function normally. However, the gate's active field deals 10 (3d6) force damage (instead of 2d6).

***Gatehouse.*** Thanks to Syranna, the Red Wizard rebels maintain control of an unmapped magic gatehouse, which is how the characters first arrive in Thay and enter the Doomvault. The gatehouse contains several permanent teleportation circles. Syranna can key these circles to any entry point (listed below). Further, any creature that possesses a glyph key can use a black gate to teleport from the Doomvault to a permanent teleportation circle in the gatehouse.

The gatehouse also has a huge physical gate, facing east into Thay just west of Lake Thaylambar. This gate is built into a cliff about 30 miles northwest of Eltabbar and about 30 miles south of Keluthar. Syranna usually keeps this gate sealed, opening it only for emergencies. She raises this gate to allow characters out of the gatehouse and into Thay only if you decide she does so.

***Entry Points.*** Choose a starting location for the party from among the seven entry points in the Doomvault. Black gates in the following areas have entry points labeled on the map: *area 1* (Abyssal Prisons), *area 23* (Blood Pens), *area 33* (Masters' Domain), *area 38* (Far Realm Cysts), *area 49* (Forests of Slaughter), *area 61* (Ooze Grottos), and *area 77* (Predator Pools).

***Glyph Keys.*** A magic crystal pendant on a bronze chain, a glyph key allows creatures to manipulate a handful of specific magic gates within the Doomvault. A glyph key is attuned to a zone or zones, allowing manipulation of gates within the attuned areas. For example, a glyph key attuned to the Temple of Chaos (areas 4 through 7) allows its user to use a functional black gate to open a portal to the black gate in *area 7*, as well as to pass through the white gates between *area 4* and *area 2*, between *area 6* and *area 8* or *area 16*, and between *area 7* and *area 12*.

Touching a glyph key provides a telepathic sense of the name of its attuned zone or zones. Thus, when the characters find glyph keys, they know which zones the keys are for.

A glyph key can hold multiple attunements, and attunements can be passed from one key to another. Only one attunement can be passed at a time. To pass an attunement, one creature must hold the originating key and another creature must hold the target key. The keys must touch. Then, as an action, the creature holding the originating key must make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check succeeds, each key shares the chosen attunement. If the check fails, the attunement remains in the originating key and each key's holder takes 2 (1d4) force damage. Also, if the check fails by 5 or more, the originating key is destroyed.

***Temples of Extraction Glyph Keys.*** The Temples of Extraction are the site of Szass Tam's dark experiments with the Chosen of the gods, and security there is tighter than anywhere else in the Doomvault. Only four glyph keys to this sector, one for each zone, are outside the Temples of Extraction sector. They are in *area 10*, *area 25*, *area 31*, and *area 63*. The characters need to find these glyph keys to gain access to the temples.

#### Common Features
This section details further generalities about the Doomvault. Descriptions in specific areas take precedence over this overview.

***Atmosphere.*** Abjuration magic keeps the dungeon dry and at a comfortable temperature. A *detect magic* spell reveals this magic as a faint aura on all the Doomvault's surfaces.

***Construction.*** Regular rooms and their features are of worked and finished stone, mostly marble. Caverns are rough-hewn stone.

Ceilings rise from 20 feet to vaults of 30 feet. Caverns have natural ceilings roughly 30 feet high. Corridor ceilings are 20 feet high.

***Contact Stones.*** Each zone contains a circle of magical glyphs displayed on a wall or an object. These locations serve as contact stones, allowing someone who has a glyph key to contact the gatehouse. The characters can use any contact stone to contact Syranna and have her attune glyph keys to the zone where the contact stone is located.

When the characters see a contact stone on a wall for the first time, use the following description.

>>Glowing glyphs form a circle on the wall about three feet off the floor.
>>

Thereafter, you can shorten the description of the contact stones they encounter to avoid repetition.

***Normal Doors.*** The Doomvault's doors are wood reinforced with steel, and they open easily. Most doors lack latches, bars, or locks. Those that are locked require a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to pick or a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open.

***Secret Doors.*** A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to find a typical secret door.

***False Doors.*** A character must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine that a door is real or false without opening it.

***Light.*** Insubstantial magic orbs provide bright light in areas that indicate no other illumination conditions. Boxed text meant to be communicated to the players assumes that someone can see the described area.

***Pit Traps.*** A typical pit trap is under a 5-foot-square section of floor, which forms a lid hinged on the inner side and lined with lead. A character within 5 feet of the lid might notice it with a successful DC 20 passive Perception check. A character who searches the area notices the lid with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. A lid can be jammed so that it remains closed by a character who makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Otherwise, the lid falls open when a Small or larger creature places weight on it.

A creature that triggers the lid must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet onto a bed of stone spikes, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and 13 (2d12) piercing damage. The pit walls are smooth stone. The lid closes magically 5 minutes after being triggered. The lead on the lid prevents the magic of a closed trap from being detected.

#### Dungeon Denizens
The Red Wizards, aided and abetted by their Thayan servants, hold sway over the Doomvault. In addition to battling the monstrous residents of the dungeon, the characters will need to contend with these humanoids.

***Thayans as Foes.*** Thayan humanoids in the dungeon, especially Red Wizards, prefer to survive encounters with the characters. (All Thayans in the dungeon are non-good in alignment, and most of them are lawful.) When hard pressed, a few might be convinced to surrender, by the use of Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) checks. Under interrogation, however, most of these villains lie or otherwise mislead the characters, aiming to kill them with misinformation. Thayans who escape the characters' assault and have no other purpose either leave the Doomvault through the gatehouse or join patrols that attempt to hunt down the characters.

***Prisoners.*** Most humanoid prisoners are terrified and have only enough strength to avoid battle. Prisoners do hard labor or end up as food for the dungeon's monsters. They have no glyph keys and can't leave their zone without help. If able, freed prisoners beg for aid in escaping. If given glyph keys, they head to the gatehouse. Use the **commoner** for prisoners if needed.

#### Reduced-Threat Monsters
A reduced-threat monster uses a normal monster's statistics, but it has half the normal hit point maximum and takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and saving throw DCs.

A reduced threat creature that is based on a creature bigger than Large is instead Large. Some specific reduced-threat creatures also make changes to the abilities they can use. A reduced-threat creature is worth half the normal XP earned for defeating it.

### Dungeon State
This adventure describes each area as it exists when the characters first arrive in the Doomvault. As they explore, they change the dungeon's state. Record the state each area is in when the characters leave. You need to track which rooms have been explored, which monsters have been defeated, which secrets remain undiscovered, what treasure has been taken, and so on. If the characters return to an area, your notes can remind you what is different from the original text.

### Resting
The incursion into the Doomvault is intended to be a fast-paced assault in which the characters have little time for typical rests. A few areas of the dungeon offer access to special magic that allows characters to gain the benefit of a rest.

The adventure assumes the characters stay in or close to the dungeon for the duration of their exploration. If you want the characters to be able to leave and return to the Doomvault, Syranna can use the circles in the gatehouse to send the party just about anywhere (except the Temples of Extraction or the Phylactery Vault). She can also allow the characters to return by giving them *spell scrolls* of *teleportation circle* keyed to the circles in the gatehouse. If you allow the characters to leave the Doomvault through the gatehouse, the characters can take normal rests outside the dungeon. Doing so has an effect on the alert level.

Resting within the Doomvault is risky, because of random encounters and the rising alert level (see below).

#### Alert Level
The Doomvault is an active complex. As effects of the characters' assault grow more widespread or easily detected, the alert level of the dungeon's inhabitants rises. This level starts at 0 and can go no lower than 0. It increases by 1 every 4 hours the characters spend inside the dungeon, including resting. The alert level affects the frequency and difficulty of random encounters.

For each 24 hours the characters spend outside the dungeon, the alert level decreases by 1. During this time, the Doomvault returns to a state more stable than when the characters left. Monsters might be recaptured or replaced, and new challenges could be set up to foil incursions. Alter the dungeon's contents as you see fit to account for the returning party's previous actions and the reactions of their foes.

A few other events specified in the adventure can raise or lower the alert level.

#### Dread Warriors
Szass Tam devised the ritual that enables the creation of **dread warriors**. The lich has since altered the process to make it possible for a Red Wizard to take control of a dread warrior. The effect creates a psychic link between the dread warrior and a Red Wizard, who can, for a time, experience the world through the dread warrior's senses, speak with its mouth, and cast spells through it. A powerful wizard can control more than one dread warrior at a time.

When a party in the Doomvault encounters a dread warrior that isn't in the company of a Red Wizard or **Tarul Var**, a special interaction may occur. If the dread warrior survives until end of the third round (or for more than 20 seconds), **Tarul Var** (see *area 10*) becomes aware of the group's presence. Var's attention raises the overall alert level by 1. In addition, **Tarul Var** takes control of the dread warrior by the start of its next turn. Instead of allowing the warrior to attack, Var uses the warrior's actions to cast his spells through it.

When Var becomes aware of the group through a dread warrior, the warrior's eyes glow with pale light. If someone casts *counterspell* or *dispel magic* on the dread warrior during this time, and successfully dispels a 5th-level spell, Var's connection is suppressed for 1 minute. Preemptively casting *dispel magic* on a dread warrior can have the same effect.

### Random Encounters
Random encounters help determine if characters meet other creatures moving through the Doomvault. Consider rolling for an encounter in these circumstances:

- The party enters a zone within which they've previously defeated most of the monsters.
- The party moves between zones while the Doomvault has an alert level of 6 or higher.
- The alert level rises.

These encounters are more for atmosphere than challenge. Any random encounter should be foreshadowed with noise or other cues. If a result you roll makes no sense for a given area, select a different result that does.

At least one creature in a random encounter has a glyph key attuned to the zone it is in or an adjacent zone. In cases where foes have no way to enter an area, they instead follow the party into that area.

#### Encounter Type
If a random encounter is indicated, roll on the Encounter Type table, adding the current alert level to the roll. Then roll on the indicated table to determine the encounter specifics.

#### Special Encounters
If creatures leave their normal areas to roam the dungeon, add them to your notes as possible special encounters. If necessary, Syranna covertly helps such creatures move about the dungeon to add to the confusion and to aid the overall mission. When you roll a special encounter, you can choose from among the creatures in your notes or roll randomly. If a creature is eliminated, delete it from your list of possible special encounters. If you roll this result while no special encounters exist, then the group has an encounter of your choice.

#### Treasure
The adventure has some treasure built in, but the characters might be able to find more.

***Changing Treasure.*** Feel free to change the treasure in the Doomvault or add more. It's especially appropriate to change treasure to something characters in the party can use, and it's satisfying to let them claim it from a defeated monster or Thayan. For instance, if you'd like to give a character a magic weapon, you can change a weapon-using monster to account for the treasure.

***Thayans' Potions.*** Each group of Thayans has among them 1d4−2 potions (minimum 0), each one determined by rolling on the following table.

| 2d4 | Potion |
|:---:|---|
| 2 | *Flying* |
| 3–4 | *Climbing* |
| 5–7 | *Healing*(1–3), *Greater Healing* (4–5), *Superior Healing* (6) |
| 8 | *Invisibility* |

***Red Wizards.*** Each Red Wizard encountered in the adventure carries 4d10 gp. A Red Wizard also carries 1d4–2 (minimum 0) *spell scrolls*, each containing a random arcane spell of 1st or 2nd level, most often *darkvision*, *daylight*, *detect magic*, *identify*, *invisibility*, or *thunderwave*. Twenty-five percent of Red Wizards (determine randomly using a d4) instead have one 3rd-level *spell scroll*, either of *dispel magic* or *remove curse*.

***Dread Warriors.*** A dread warrior carries no gold, but some of them have weapons or armor, determined by rolling on the following table.

| 2d4 | Item |
|:---:|---|
| 2–6 | None |
| 7 | *+1 weapon* (usually a battleaxe or a javelin) |
| 8 | *+1 chain mail* |

### Character Death
When a character dies, the player has a few options.

#### Soul Binding
The rebel Red Wizards can use the mighty magic of the Doomvault, which traps souls, to raise fallen adventurers as soul-bound dead. If a player chooses this option, the dead character returns to play with no changes.

Syranna warns such characters that a soul-bound creature created in this way will die permanently upon leaving the Doomvault. Furthermore, over the course of many weeks, a character who remains in this state loses any identity and becomes a wight under the control of the Red Wizards. To have any hope of exiting the dungeon, the character must end the soul-bound condition.

Syranna conveys that the undying laboratory (*area 31*) allows soul-bound characters to transform back to normal, but she lacks the knowledge of how this feat is accomplished.

#### New Character
The player selects or creates a new character who joins the group. Syranna coordinates uniting newcomers with a group in the dungeon. Such characters might be Thayan Resurrection members anxious to join the fight against Szass Tam. The new character could have been a prisoner in the Doomvault, released to help the rebels. Regardless of origin, the character arrives with the necessary resources and information to join the party.

### Doomvault Lore
Some creatures that the characters encounter can divulge important information about the Doomvault. When you give out lore, reveal information appropriate to the creature being questioned based on its location and circumstance. You can make information more specific and useful, but the basics of the lore should be conveyed.

#### Sectors
Some pieces of lore are threats and rumors known to those without firsthand experience of a sector. Creatures inside a sector are likely to know more specific details, especially about their neighboring zones; the DM is encouraged to provide appropriate details wherever creatures are noted to have lore to offer.

- In the Abyssal Prisons, the maze of undoing (*area 15*) has no easy exit, but fiends that can climb are said to have somehow escaped the magic there.
- In the Far Realm Cysts, the creatures of chaos keep intruders away from a powerful shrine.
- In the Forests of Slaughter, the most cunning hunters seek to steal glyph keys.
- In the Forests of Slaughter, magic pools can heal creatures that drink from them.
- In the Golem Laboratories, no Red Wizard will enter the glowing green archways.
- In the Masters' Domain, the Temples of Despair are used for the torture and execution of those who oppose Szass Tam.
- In the Masters' Domain, necromancy can be reshaped to restore life.
- In the Ooze Grottos, the power of the white pillar can heal or harm.
- In the Predator Pools, the hag seeks allies in her plot against the naga.
- In the Predator Pools, vats hold power over life.

#### Temples of Extraction
Pieces of lore about the Temples of Extraction are presented in the order in which they should be revealed:

- The Temples of Extraction aren't temples at all but research facilities where Szass Tam's followers conduct profane magical experiments. Few know the specifics of what happens there.
- Only black gates allow access to the Temples of Extraction. Only Szass Tam's most trusted servants have the glyph keys attuned to that sector.
- Szass Tam's latest plan to become a god is his most ambitious. He intends to feed the souls of the Chosen into his phylactery through the Temples of Extraction.
- Szass Tam is making sure that his plan will work by channeling the souls of the Chosen into the phylacteries of his underlings, which are stored in the Phylactery Vault beneath the Doomvault.
- Disrupting the flow of soul energy into the phylacteries should destroy them, dealing an incalculable blow to Szass Tam's power.

#### Phylactery Vault
Pieces of lore about the Phylactery Vault are presented in the order in which they should be revealed:

- Beneath the Doomvault, the demilich Kazit Gul slumbers in his Phylactery Vault.
- Szass Tam repurposed the Phylactery Vault for his own magical experiments.
- The phylacteries of the highest-ranking liches in Szass Tam's service rest in the Phylactery Vault, protected by powerful magic. Szass Tam holds the phylacteries there to keep his lackeys in check.
- If enough black gates across the Doomvault are disrupted, the black gates in the Temples of Extraction can be forced to connect to the Phylactery Vault.

## Into the Doomvault
The characters arrive in the Doomvault through the Bloodgate Nexus or a similar magic portal. How and why they come is up to you. Perhaps the Thayan rebels call for help, alerting forces on the Sword Coast that some of those who assaulted the Bloodgate are alive but captive in the Doomvault. Maybe Syranna snatches heroes from somewhere in the world near another magic gateway. In any case, the characters arrive in the dungeon's gatehouse by teleportation.

To start the adventure, read:

>>You arrive in a shadowy hall with glowing teleportation circles etched into the floor. Before you have time to consider your situation, the image of a female Red Wizard suddenly appears and speaks.
>>
>>"I am Syranna," she says. "It was I who brought you here. Welcome to Thay."
>>

Syranna is present only as an image through which she can sense and communicate. She goes on as follows.

>>"Many Red Wizards chafe under the rule of Szass Tam. Once, Thay was a land of learning and power. Now, death scours Thay while the lich lord ignores all concerns other than his quest to become a god. If his mad plans are left to run their course, none will be left alive here to worship him.
>>
>>"This is a magic gatehouse, from which I can send you to the Doomvault—the heart of the lich lord's domain deep beneath the Thaymount. The Doomvault is a secret laboratory and containment structure, beneath which lies a hidden storehouse where the phylacteries of Szass Tam's elite liches are held. There, the lich lord's power can be broken... with your aid.
>>
>>"I offer you an opportunity to take the fight to the lich lord. I offer you the chance to help me see to it that Szass Tam's power is broken. The Phylactery Vault is where you can make that happen.
>>
>>"What say you?"
>>

Syranna is a rebellion leader who knows that her life could end at any time. She means to make every moment count. She doesn't rest while the characters assault the Doomvault.

Syranna is lawful neutral. She has a sense of righteousness colored by fatalism. Her belief is that death is better than being raised as another of Szass Tam's undead servants. With the characters, she is honest and forthright, as well as cynical.

Unfortunately for the characters, Syranna isn't familiar with the inside of the Doomvault. Her position as overseer of the gatehouse has given her only general knowledge of the dungeon. She explains that her ignorance is an intentional part of the dungeon's security structure. If given time, however, she can confirm Doomvault lore that the characters learn.

Syranna can relate the following information to the characters:

- For centuries, the Doomvault was a legend. Kazit Gul, a Red Wizard who spent his life studying the deadliest dungeons on many worlds, planned it. As a living human and a lich, Gul fashioned the vast complex based on his research. The purpose of the dungeon was to lure explorers to their deaths and harvest their souls to fuel Gul's phylactery.
- As Thay became more hostile to outsiders, fewer people sought the Doomvault. Eventually, unable to fuel his phylactery, Gul became a demilich. Szass Tam discovered the Doomvault and saw the opportunity to rebuild and repurpose it.
- The Doomvault is a vast, active complex of laboratories and menageries dedicated to creating the monstrous armies with which the Red Wizards plan to conquer first the North, then all of Faerûn. The dungeon is divided into sectors dedicated to the creation and control of specific types ofmonsters.
- Each sector is subdivided into protected zones for security, defending against attack from outside and betrayal from within, as well as the escape of confined creatures. Magical white gates block corridors, preventing physical access between zones. Magical black gates are teleportation circles that connect different parts of the dungeon. Syranna describes each gate type's appearance so the characters know the gates by sight.
- Magic crystals called glyph keys, when attuned to a zone, allow access to that zone's gates. Syranna describes the use of glyph keys, including how to transfer attunements. She also describes contact stones and how the characters can use them to contact her directly. Through contact stones, the characters can also gain glyph key attunements for the zone in which the contact stone is situated. Syranna initially provides the party with one glyph key.
- The characters have three goals: (1) Destroy the Red Wizards' monstrous creations and experiments to end the threat to Faerûn. (2) Gain access to the Phylactery Vault deep beneath the dungeon. (3) Destroy the phylacteries within the vault.
- **Tarul Var**'s quarters lie in the Doomvault. Although the lich was defeated, he might have already rematerialized thanks to the power of his phylactery. Protected by his dread warriors, he is a deadly threat.
- Syranna provides information on dread warriors and how **Tarul Var** uses them.
- Szass Tam controls entry to the Phylactery Vault. Syranna knows the vault connects to the greater Doomvault, but hasn't discovered how to access it.
- The rebels will use their power to stop magical communications to the outside and contain any enemies who escape from the Doomvault. They'll make sure that no one outside the dungeon knows of or reacts to what's happening until the characters succeed.
- Thayans have taken two adventurers, **Shalendra Floshin** and **Kelson Darktreader**, prisoner. They are likely dead or within the Doomvault.

Once the characters are finished talking, Syranna teleports in a map of the dungeon for the party (give the players map 5.2) and a glyph key attuned to the zone you chose as an entry point. She wishes the party well.

![[002-dit02.jpg|right|300]]

## Abyssal Prisons
Originally an area containing summoning traps, this sector has been changed into a place for confining demons. Thayans break the will of imprisoned fiends and bind them into service.

Locations in the Abyssal Prisons are identified on map 5.3.

![[003-dit03.png|right|300]]

***Light.*** Dim light radiates from the walls, floors, and ceilings in this sector, a manifestation of strengthened dimensional barriers that prevent fiends from teleporting or summoning other demons within the sector.

### Fiendish Arena
In this zone, a vampire named Issem culls the weakest demons using arena combat. When the demons fight, the battle can be heard in every chamber in this zone (see "Pit Battle" in *area 2* to aid in narrating the noise).

#### 1. Chandelier Chamber

>>Scorched and shattered plaster shows faint signs of frescoes that once covered the walls here. A half-dozen ruined chandeliers hang from the cracked ceiling. In the northeast corner is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** A **vampire spawn** keeps watch here, along with a **wight** and four **zombies**. A **quasit** perches invisibly on a chandelier.

***Negotiation.*** Prisoners regularly move through the black gate here. The characters can bluff their way through by talking to Eldrath, a female human vampire spawn that challenges them. If the characters fail to talk their way through or make it obvious in any way that they don't belong here, the monsters attack.

#### 2. Arena

>>This area might once have been a columned temple. Its rotting tapestries show foul creatures tormenting humanoids in scenes of slaughter and sacrifice. At the center of this vast space, the stone floor has been hewn to create a pit. This pit is covered with the gory remains of past bloodshed.
>>

***Creatures.*** Issem, a pale human **vampire** in lavish clothes, is normally in this area, watching battles.

***Negotiation.*** An old curse binds Issem to the Doomvault and to the service of the Thayans, but he hates the Red Wizards, so he is willing to talk. He can offer two pieces of lore (see "Doomvault Lore" above), and he allows prisoners and the characters to leave the area. He is willing to lie to any Thayans who seek the characters and help them cover their tracks.

Issem warns anyone who tries to enter *area 3* against doing so. If someone does anyway, the vampire attacks.

***Fighting Pit.*** This rough-hewn arena is 15 feet lower than the floor around it and imbued with magic. Any non-undead creature that approaches within 10 feet of the edge must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to leap into the pit (a creature ignores this effect if immune to being charmed). Such a creature can't leave the pit until all the demons within it are destroyed. The pit is otherwise easy to climb.

![[004-totyp-05-05.png|right|300]]

***Pit Battle.*** In the pit, a **reduced-threat vrock** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) is fighting ten prisoners, nine of whom are human **commoners**. The tenth is a gold elf **knight** named **Shalendra Floshin**. Half the humans each deal 1 slashing damage to the vrock each round, and Shalendra deals 10 damage to the vrock every round. The demon focuses on one target each round (roll randomly). If the characters join the battle, the vrock attacks them.

***Glyph Key.*** Issem has a glyph key attuned to this zone. He is willing to share the key's attunement in return for a taste of fresh blood. Any character who agrees to this bargain suffers the effects of Issem's bite attack.

***Development.*** If the characters succeed in getting Issem to cover for them, the Doomvault's alert level decreases by 1.

***Shalendra.*** Thayans captured Shalendra during the assault on the Bloodgate. She has managed to survive and help other prisoners stay alive. While doing so, she has learned one piece of lore. Shalendra asks for a glyph key; if given one, she goes to the gatehouse to recuperate. If not, she goes looking for a key on her own. Either way, before she leaves, she can help the party for a time if they (and you) wish.

***White Gates.*** The corridor to the east contains a white gate that connects with the Temple of Chaos. Another white gate stands in the corridor that leads south to the Pools of Devotion.

#### 3. Issem's Vault
Deadly traps, which Issem avoids while in mist form, protect the vampire's sarcophagus.

>>This chamber has walls draped in black silk. Gleaming prisms float in midair, spinning slowly. At the center of the area, a great sarcophagus with its lid pushed ajar stands atop a stone dais. Along the upper edge of the sarcophagus, a series of arcane glyphs pulses with pale white light.
>>

***Cursed Prisms.*** Unless Issem is in the room, each character who is in the room and can see the prisms must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the start each of his or her turns. The first time each character fails the save, a **wraith** that looks like a shadowy duplicate of that character erupts from a prism and attacks.

***Pit Traps.*** As shown on the map, the floor has many pit traps.

***Contact Stone.*** The glyphs on the sarcophagus cause it to serve as a contact stone.

***Treasure.*** Inside the sarcophagus are six *spell scrolls* (three of *detect magic*, two of *comprehend languages*, and one of *greater restoration*). Also inside is a bottle of ink and an ink pen with fifteen sheets of parchment.

***Glyph Key.*** In addition to its treasure, the sarcophagus holds a glyph key attuned to this zone.

### Temple of Chaos
**Tarul Var** reconfigured this zone for his use.

#### 4. Mystic Circles

>>The wood-paneled walls of this long hall are scorched. Cracks in the panels reveal bare stone. Three mystic circles have been scribed in the floor, each edged with rough runes.
>>

***Locked Doors.*** These steel double doors are locked. **Tarul Var** (*area 10*) has a key in his possession.

***Steel Orb.*** A magic steel orb is hidden in a recess in the ceiling 20 feet up. Spotting it requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The steel orb is part of the mystic circle trap.

***Mystic Circle Trap.*** The circles are magical but misleadingly so. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that hidden among gibberish runes are warding glyphs that discharge lightning. If the check fails, the character discerns the false runes but doesn't notice the glyphs.

The trap activates 3 rounds after a creature enters the room. (**Tarul Var**'s steel key disables the trap for 1 minute when it is used to open the door to *area 5*.) At the start of the fourth round, and every 2 rounds thereafter, one circle (chosen randomly) glows white. At the end of the same round, lightning discharges through the room from the steel orb in the ceiling. When the lightning discharges, any creature in the room must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

A character who touches the steel orb and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can suppress the orb's magic, disabling the trap for 1d4 rounds. A *dispel magic* spell cast on the orb suppresses the magic for 1 hour. In both cases, the character doesn't know how long the suppression might last. The circles continue to glow at random.

***White Gate.*** The corridor that separates this area from the Fiendish Arena contains a white gate.

#### 5. Succubus Vault

>>The sweet scent of incense hangs in the hot air of this opulent chamber. The walls are covered with silk tapestries in green and yellow, and the floors are spread with cushions. To the south, two sets of sliding double wooden doors are set in the walls.
>>

![[005-totyp-05-06.png|right|300]]

***Creatures.*** Pencheska, a **succubus**, resides here with four **Thayan warriors**, who are in her thrall. Pencheska is an unwilling servant of **Tarul Var**.

If she is alerted to the characters' approach, the succubus takes on a humanoid form. She attempts to convince the characters that she is being held prisoner.

Pencheska isn't pleased with her situation and won't directly oppose the characters unless they attack her. She is willing to provide a piece of lore about the Phylactery Vault in the hope that the characters might destroy **Tarul Var** for good, freeing her to escape the Doomvault.

***Closets.*** The sliding wooden doors open to reveal closets that contain fine female clothing in numerous styles and sizes. The easternmost closet contains a hemispherical stone in the middle of its back wall. The stone serves as a contact stone in this zone.

***Heat.*** This chamber is uncomfortably hot due to the fire elemental in *area 6*. The heat grows more intense to the east and in the eastern secret passage.

***Treasure.*** Pencheska's adornments include a gold gorget set with yellow topazes (500 gp), matching earrings (250 gp), a ruby ring (300 gp), an intricate jade necklace (400 gp) and two matching jade rings (200 gp each).

In the westernmost closet, hooks hold several items of jewelry, including a simple gold necklace and bracelet (250 gp each), a silver necklace with a garnet pendant (250 gp), and an ivory necklace (100 gp).

***Glyph Key.*** Pencheska has a glyph key attuned to this zone, which hangs in the closet among her jewelry.

#### 6. Elemental Furnace
A character who listens at either doorway feels heat and hears a crackling roar.

>>A blast of heat escapes as the door opens. A howling creature of flame roils at the center of a soot-streaked stone chamber whose walls are lined with glowing runes.
>>

***Creature.*** The **fire elemental** here flares out toward any creature it can see, but the runes on the wall glow more brightly when it does, and it stops short of making contact with any intruder. The elemental can't attack or leave the room. Instead, it babbles in Ignan (a dialect of Primordial), often using the word "home." Even though the elemental doesn't attack, any creature that ends its turn in the room takes 3 (1d6) fire damage as long as the elemental is present.

The runes on the wall are a set of arcane bonds that keep the elemental confined here. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check discerns the connection. If a character who can cast spells then succeeds on three consecutive DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) checks while continually touching the wall, the bonds are suppressed long enough for the elemental to leave the room. A *dispel magic* spell cast on the runes suppresses the bonds for 1 minute.

The elemental follows its rescuer, fighting alongside that person. If the elemental sees the rift in *area 7*, it uses the rift to leave the Doomvault and return to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

***White Gate.*** A white gate is located east of this area at the junction of the corridors that lead to the Abyssal Gate and to the Vermin Halls.

#### 7. Chaos Rift
Characters approaching this area can hear the roar of the elemental rift, which also generates bright light in the entire chamber.

>>This enormous hall is set with rows of pillars carved in the shapes of elemental and demonic creatures. A great rift has been torn in the center of the stone floor. Through it, a stream of chaotic energy blasts upward, flowing into a similar rift in the vaulted ceiling forty feet above. Tendrils split off from the pulsing column of energy, lashing out to strike the nearest pillars.
>>
>>In the southwest corner is a black gate.
>>

A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check can tell that the rift is channeling elemental forces. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character knows that the rift is dangerous and is channeling extraplanar elemental forces.

If a non-elemental creature ends its turn inside the room, it takes 5 (2d4) damage of a random type (roll a d10: 1–2, acid; 3–4, cold; 5–6, fire; 7–8, lightning; 9–10, thunder).

Any creature that enters the rift can choose to remain here or go to an elemental plane. Characters who go to an elemental plane must use the rift to return on their next turn or they become trapped.

### Abyssal Gate
**Tarul Var** oversees this zone, in which the Thayans have tapped Abyssal power.

#### 8. Summoning Chamber
A character listening at the doors can hear the shrieks of any demons bound here.

>>This area might once have been a great banquet hall, but its furnishings now lie in rotting piles along the walls. Between rows of pillars, six great magic circles glow brightly, illuminating the whole chamber.
>>

***Creatures.*** One **dread warrior**, two **wights**, and six **zombies** patrol the area.

***Summoning Circles.*** Two summoning circles are empty. The other four contain creatures:

>**Circle A**. One **reduced-threat hezrou** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above)
>
>**Circle B**. Four **quasits**
>
>**Circle C**. One **reduced-threat vrock** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above)
>
>**Circle D**. Ten **manes**
>

A bound demon can't escape from its circle without assistance, and aside from attempts to communicate, nothing it does can affect anything outside the circle. All demons except for the manes ask to be released, promising to attack the Thayan forces if they are freed. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character knows that, as an action, they can scuff the boundary of a circle to disrupt the circle's magic for 1 minute. During that time, a demon within the circle can break free with a successful DC 15 Wisdom check.

A freed demon attacks the nearest creature that isn't a demon.

***Development.*** If any demon other than the manes remains free in this area, all the demons are eventually freed from their circles by the others. They spill out into the zone and attack any creature they find. That fact should be noted as part of the dungeon state.

***White Gates.*** A white gate is located north of this area at the junction of the corridors that lead to the Temple of Chaos and to the Vermin Halls. Another gate lies in the passage to the east that connects with the Swine Run.

#### 9. Dead End

>>A set of double doors is inlaid with brass filigree, marking out the shapes of angelic figures.
>>

***Advance Notice.*** A character who searches the floor in the eastern corridor and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check ascertains that no other creatures have entered this side passage in a long time.

If examined with a *detect magic* spell, the area displays an aura of necromancy.

***Stunning Shadow Trap.*** If the doors are opened, roll initiative. Darkness immediately fills the corridor out to 20 feet from the doors. Any non-undead creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and become paralyzed until the start of its next turn. The darkness remains as long as the doors are open.

#### 10. Tarul Var's Quarters

>>Tapestries line the walls of these well-appointed living quarters. Standing screens divide the space into smaller sections containing couches, tables, and desks.
>>

![[006-totyp-05-07.png|right|300]]

***Creatures.*** Here resides the lich **Tarul Var** with his guards, four **dread warriors**. Having lost the Bloodgate, Var is confined to this area because of his fear of Szass Tam, while he awaits his master's final judgment.

The lich attacks immediately. His guards emerge from various positions to screen him from direct attack. **Tarul Var** can cast any of his spells from one of the dread warriors.

The dread warriors attempt to drag any helpless characters to the pit in the intersection near this room or to *area 9*, where they throw open the doors.

Devious and arrogant, **Tarul Var** thinks all other creatures are beneath him. He berates the characters at every opportunity, and he drives his underlings to cruelty.

If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, Var offers the party access to his glyph key's attunements and his steel key (see "Treasure" below), as well as two pieces of lore, in exchange for his freedom and his silence. If the characters let Var go, he flees the Doomvault, reasoning that the characters' disruptions will draw Szass Tam's attention away from him. If the lich is destroyed here, he might later be destroyed permanently if the party succeeds in collapsing the Phylactery Vault.

***Contact Stone.*** A circle of glowing glyphs above Var's desk in the western section of the room serves as a contact stone.

***Treasure.*** A search of the desk reveals several drafts of a letter to Szass Tam in which Var begs for another chance to bring the Sword Coast under Thayan domination. Inside the desk's several drawers are a *potion of mind reading* and a duplicate of the steel key that Var carries.

The largest drawer of the desk is held closed with an *arcane lock* spell (requiring a successful DC 25 Strength check to break). Inside is a flat box of black wood (see the next subsection) and a gold coffer wrought to look like a sleeping dragon with violet garnet eyes (worth 1,000 gp). The coffer holds 200 pp and a dark, smooth river rock (a *loadstone*).

***True Name Box.*** If *detect magic* is used on the black box, the contents give off an aura of evocation magic. The box contains several pieces of parchment. A portion of the top page stored in the box has runes on it that, when read by anyone other than **Tarul Var**, cause the page to explode.

The runes can be neutralized by using *dispel magic* on the box or the page. Alternatively, a character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence check can remove the page from the box without inadvertently reading the runes. If the check fails, the character reads the runes accidentally, triggering the explosion.

If the page explodes, everyone within 10 feet of the box must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, which the reader makes with disadvantage. A creature takes 21 (6d6) force damage on a failed saving throw and half as much damage on a successful one. The box and its contents are destroyed if the runes go off.

The box contains records of true names of minor devils and describes plans to use them in the attack on the Sword Coast. It also contains historical documents that indicate that Var was searching for the true name of a pit fiend called Baazka.

***Keys.*** **Tarul Var** carries a glyph key attuned to this zone and to the Temples of Anguish (in the Temples of Extraction sector). He also has an ornate steel key (worth 5 gp) that opens the locked doors on the east wall of *area 4*.

#### 11. Torture Chamber
A character who listens at the doors can hear the howls of the glabrezu if it's bound here.

>>The walls of this torture chamber are hung with chains and spears encrusted with black ichor. In a few places, heavy black chains are fastened to the floor. In the northeast corner is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** A **wight** and seven **skeletons** are tormenting a prone, **reduced-threat glabrezu** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) that is shackled and chained to the floor in four places. The undead attack interlopers, using pikes as weapons (1d10 piercing damage). The undead have magic weapons (see "Treasure" below).

***Shackled Glabrezu.*** The bound glabrezu can't free itself. It can't cast spells or summon demons. It can attack only if a creature comes within 5 feet of it, which is why the undead are using pikes. When a battle starts, the demon demands to be freed, promising to "lay waste to these undead and their masters." If the characters refuse to aid it, the demon attacks them if it can.

To free the demon, a character must pick the locks of all four iron shackles (requiring a successful DC 15 Dexterity check for each). If it is freed, the glabrezu rampages, randomly attacking anyone in reach. Once free, it can cast spells, but it still can't summon demons.

***Shackles.*** The ten sets of shackles and their chains are made of rune-scribed iron. A demon held in them can't escape them while the shackles are closed. The magic on the chains renders them unbreakable, so they can't be removed from this room.

***Dungeon State.*** If the glabrezu is left free in this area, it eventually frees the demons in *area 8* from their circles. That fact should be noted as part of the dungeon state.

***Treasure.*** The skeletons' pikes are enchanted with *magic weapon* (+1) for 1 more hour. The wight wields a *+1 pike*.

### Halls of Conditioning
After their initial subjugation, captured demons are held in the Halls of Conditioning, where they are properly broken to service.

#### 12. False Pit Gauntlet
Communicate the boxed text before any character crosses the threshold into this room.

>>The walls here consist of worked stone, but the thirty-foot-high ceiling of this broad chamber features rough rock hung with jagged stalactites. Seams in the floor tiles divide the space into squares five feet on a side. An open pit extends halfway across each of the four entryways, just inside the room.
>>

***Aura.*** A *detect magic* spell cast on this area reveals that magic permeates the entire room, focused most strongly at the open mouth of each pit.

***False Pits.*** The pits appear normal, but an invisible force field extends across the apparently open space atop each pit. The horizontal field can hold the weight of any number of characters.

***Gravity Trap.*** Any creature that enters the room and walks across the invisible field covering one of the open pits deactivates the gravity trap for 1 minute. Once deactivated, characters can move freely across the room for 1 minute before the trap reactivates. If the trap is active, any creature that enters the room without stepping onto the invisible field over one of the false pits is hurled toward the ceiling, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage from the stalactites and remaining restrained on the ceiling for 1 minute. Then the creature is released and drops to the floor, taking 10 (3d6) falling damage and landing prone in a random square near the center of the chamber. Moving onto or over the floor triggers the gravity trap again, but the creature can remain safe if it stays in the space where it fell until another character deactivates the trap.

#### 13. Sorlan's Haunt
The lock plainly visible on each of the double doors is false. The real locks and keyholes are hidden in the base of each door and detectable with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If any attempt is made to pick a false lock or force the doors, any creature within 10 feet of the doors must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw (with disadvantage, if trying to pick a lock or force the doors) or take 5 (2d4) force damage and be knocked prone.

>>This ruined chamber has tapestries and paintings that have been slashed and are shot through with black mold. The fine furnishings and cushions are rotted through and crumbling, and the air is heavy with the scent of decay.
>>

***Creature.*** Sorlan, a former adventurer who was imprisoned by the Red Wizards and subjected to horrible experiments, lives on as a **ghost** that is bound to this room. He hates the Red Wizards, and he immediately tries to attack all who enter his chamber, screaming that allies of the Red Wizards must die. If the characters convince Sorlan that they are opposed to the Red Wizards by making a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, the ghost stops attacking and can provide two pieces of lore, which he has overheard from passing Red Wizards.

Sorlan also tells the characters to avoid the maze of undoing (*area 15*), which is where he was captured while trying to escape the dungeon. He doesn't know the trick to overcoming the teleportation trap. If he is slain, Sorlan reappears in this *area 24* hours later.

***White Gate.*** The secret door on the west wall opens into a narrow corridor that leads to a white gate. Beyond the gate (and another secret door) is a corridor that connects with the Pools of Devotion.

#### 14. Demon Cells

>>Several cages line this chamber from floor to ceiling. Three of them hold various demons, which are raging futilely and silently against their confinement. The wall in the southwest corner contains a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** One Red Wizard **conjurer** oversees one **deathlock wight** and one **Thayan apprentice**. The conjurer knows the pass phrase for the maze of undoing (*area 15*) and might provide it to the characters in exchange for mercy, knowing that freed demons will attack their "rescuers."

***Cells.*** Cells that confine demons hold the following creatures:

**Cell A**. One **hezrou**

**Cell B**. Eight **quasits**

**Cell C**. Two **vrocks**

Each cell has iron, rune-scribed bars (warded against demons). Transmutation magic on the bars renders them unbreakable, so a demon can't escape the cell and, indeed, can't pass any part of its body between the bars. Further, no sound can pass out of a cell into the larger room. To free a demon, a character must pick the lock on the cage door (requiring a successful DC 20 Dexterity check). A freed demon attacks everyone in the room.

***Keys.*** The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this zone, as well as a ring of keys to the cells.

***Dungeon State.*** If any demon remains free in this area, all the demons are eventually freed from their cells. That fact should be noted as part of the dungeon state.

#### 15. Maze of Undoing

>>A short hall of gray granite runs perpendicular to this area's entrance, with six openings across from the entrance that lead deeper into the darkness. The cold stone ceiling looms thirty feet overhead.
>>

***Teleportation Maze.*** Conjuration magic infuses the area, emanating most strongly at the trigger points numbered 1 through 20, and at the two entry/exit trigger points labeled E on the map. In addition to the teleportation trigger points, the magic aligns gravity to the nearest surface. Therefore, creatures standing on the floor consider "down" to be beneath their feet, while creatures on the ceiling consider that surface to be "down" and are situated accordingly. The entire area was created to capture and hold demons.

Any creature that enters a trigger point on the floor teleports immediately to the ceiling above another trigger point (determined by a d20 roll). The creature must then succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (2d4) psychic damage and fall to the floor, taking 10 (3d6) falling damage and triggering another teleportation point. On a successful save, the creature takes no damage and can utilize the weird gravity until the end of its next turn, walking along the ceiling and walls as though they were the floor, and bypassing the teleportation triggers. If the creature is still above the floor at the end of its next turn, it falls the appropriate distance to the floor and triggers another teleportation point.

In addition to conjuration magic, the entry/exit points also radiate abjuration magic. Until someone utters the proper pass phrase (see *area 14*), a demon caught in the maze can't pass through either of the entry/exit points. For non-demons, leaving the maze can be accomplished by moving along the walls or ceiling and out of the area through either entry/exit point.

***Creature.*** When the characters arrive, a **glabrezu** is trapped in the maze. The demon has learned how to navigate the maze, even though it can't escape the area. Place the demon on the ceiling above a random teleportation trigger point in the maze (roll a d20). Once the demon notices the characters, it moves toward characters it can see and in its rage and madness attacks any creatures it manages to reach.

***Black Gate.*** A black gate is set into the southern alcove, not immediately visible from the entrance.

## Blood Pens
The Red Wizards are breeding and raising monsters in their own foul nurseries.

Locations in the Blood Pens are identified on map 5.4.

![[007-dit04.png|right|300]]

### Vermin Halls
The vermin-summoning magic of these halls now serves the Thayans.

#### 16. Gallery of Swarms
The Red Wizards no longer use this chamber.

***Sounds.*** A character who listens at the door and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears distant chittering.

***Light. None.*** 
>>The sunken floor of this huge hall is covered in dead insects, their dried shells shifting and whispering in a faint breeze. Dozens of demonic faces are carved in the white marble walls of the chamber, slight gusts whistling from each of their open mouths. Down the center of the chamber, toward the doors at the far end, a series of black stone platforms are set like oversized stepping stones.
>>

***Demonic Faces.*** The mouths of these relief carvings are the source of the magical breeze.

***Insect Floor.*** The floor is 2 feet below the level of the doors and filled completely with dead insects along with occasional bones, making it difficult terrain.

***Pit Traps.*** Scattered through the room, hidden beneath the blanket of insect bodies, are several pit traps. It is impossible to notice a pit passively; finding one requires a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each pit is filled with dead insects, so falling into one deals only half damage. Someone buried in a pit full of these husks can't breathe or see.

***Trapped Platforms.*** Whenever a creature steps onto a platform, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be engulfed by a swarm of biting, stinging insects that emerge from the demonic faces. The creature takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage and 5 (2d4) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the platform in a random direction. The insects die and fall to the ground immediately after their attack.

***White Gates.*** A white gate is located west of this area at the junction of the corridors that lead to the Temple of Chaos and to the Abyssal Gate.

#### 17. Crawling Hall

>>Two enormous pillars on the far side of this chamber emit brilliant white light that holds the attention of dozens of giant vermin crawling on and around them. The vermin occasionally fight among themselves, but most of these creatures move sluggishly, as if the light has subdued them.
>>

***Glowing Pillars.*** The pillars emit magical light, which pacifies the vermin and keeps their handlers safe.

***Creatures.*** Two **Thayan apprentices** are feeding the vermin scraps and pig excrement from buckets. Six **Thayan warriors** guard the apprentices. All the Thayans attack as soon as they notice intruders. Each round of combat, the Thayans direct one **giant spider** and one **giant centipede** to join the fight.

***Development.*** Vermin left in this chamber grow hungry, feeding on any dead creatures. Within a few hours, they begin killing and feeding on each other.

***Glyph Key.*** One Thayan has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gate.*** A white gate is located in the south branch of the corridor that leads east from this area toward the Swine Run.

#### 18. Barracks

>>Rough cots scattered across the floor contrast with the decor in the east end of the room, which contains a great seat of white marble. Some of the magic lights are shrouded, so that side of the room is dimly lit.
>>
>>In the northeast corner is a black gate. West of it is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** Six **Thayan apprentices** and eight **Thayan warriors** are resting here, watched over by a **wight**. Half the warriors and apprentices are asleep in the eastern side of the chamber. When the other creatures notice the characters, they attack. The sleeping Thayans awaken and join the fight over the course of 2 or 3 rounds.

***Throne Swarm Trap.*** The 20-foot-tall white throne is a magic trap that the Thayans might use if desperate. When any non-undead creature climbs onto it, a swarm of stinging insects pours out of the back of the throne and quickly fills the chamber. Each creature in the room takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) poison damage. For 1 minute thereafter, each creature that ends its turn in the room takes 4 (1d8) piercing damage and 4 (1d8) poison damage. The insects disappear after 1 minute, and the trap resets.

***Glyph Keys.*** One Thayan has a glyph key attuned to this zone and the Swine Run. Another has a glyph key attuned to this zone and the Hatchery.

***White Gate.*** A white gate is located in the south branch of the corridor that leads west from this area toward the Swine Run.

### Swine Run
These adjoining halls have been converted into a pig farm to feed carnivorous monsters.

#### 19. Walkway Pen
***Sounds.*** The unmistakable squealing and grunting of pigs can be heard from outside any of the entrances.

***Blocked Stairs.*** Slabs of stone, each 5 feet high, block the stairs that descend into this hall along the north and east sides. Climbing over a slab costs 10 feet of movement. Once over a slab, a character can step onto a plank bridge (see below).

Knocking a slab down requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. If a slab is knocked down, the bridge collapses and packs of pigs rush into the open area (see "Pigpens" below).

>>What once must have been a great hall is now a great swine pen. Three rows of thick pillars support the ceiling. Each pillar is marked with a large X in red paint. Pigs, perhaps hundreds of them, are packed in here, shoulder to shoulder, on the floor. Ten feet above them, skeletal undead stand on a crude bridge of wooden planks, dumping food into the pigpen.
>>

***Creatures.*** Three **deathlock wights** oversee six **skeletons**. They attack intruders.

***Aura.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals a transmutation aura on the whole area, which is a simple magical effect to control the pigs' odor.

***Bridges.*** A series of unsteady plank bridges runs 10 feet above the floor, lashed to the pillars and to the slabs of rock that block the eastern stairs. Any creature that falls unconscious while on a bridge has a 50 percent chance to fall into the pigpen.

***Enchanted Pillars.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals that each pillar radiates an aura of enchantment magic. Any humanoid that touches a pillar must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. (The Thayans marked the pillars as a reminder for themselves.) A *dispel magic* spell suppresses the magic of the pillars for 1 minute.

***Floating Disk.*** An opaque, slightly concave, circular plane of magical force, 5 feet in diameter, floats on the northern side of the northern bridge to *area 20*. The disk can hold up to 1,000 pounds. It is stationary and level with the bridge, but it can be mentally directed by anyone who can see it (DC 10 Intelligence) to float to the blocked stairway that leads up to the Vermin Halls (areas 16–18).

***Pigpens.*** The pigs are maltreated, hungry, and irritated. They swarm any creature that enters the pen. Such a creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and 3 (1d6) piercing damage. Characters who take 12 damage also are knocked prone. Single-target attacks against the pigs have little effect, but an area spell clears its area of pigs until the end of the caster's next turn.

The enclosed area beneath the bridge is filled with sows and piglets. The DC for the Dexterity saving throw here is only 8.

***Drevin.*** One pig is much smaller than the others, and looks especially malnourished. A *detect magic* spell reveals that the creature radiates transmutation magic. The pig is in fact a lightfoot halfling named **Drevin**. He was a minstrel (use the **spy** statistics) who ran afoul of a Red Wizard **transmuter**. If freed of the *true polymorph* spell he is under, **Drevin** accompanies the characters until he is permitted to escape the Doomvault, at which point he departs amid promises to write great ballads about the characters' exploits.

***Glyph Keys.*** Each wight has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

#### 20. Abattoir

>>Empty wall niches might once have held works of art, but this broad gallery has now been converted to an abattoir, its floor slick with filth and gore.
>>
>>In the southeast corner is a black gate. North of the gate is a contact stone.
>>

If the pigs from *area 19* rush into this room, they move unwittingly toward the skeletons, knocking half of them prone before retreating back into the pigpen.

***Aura.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals a faint aura of transmutation magic on the whole area, which is a simple magical effect to control the odor of the butchery.

***Creatures.*** Twelve **skeletons** are here, with a **wight** and a **deathlock wight** overseeing them. Eight work to the east, stacking butchered pigs along the wall. To the west, four more work at a sluice that carries offal to the black gate, where it disappears (transported to *area 41*). Occasionally they toss some of the foul slop toward an **otyugh** chained to the floor.

The otyugh can move 40 feet from the northeast corner, anywhere within the area described by the dashed line on the map. It attacks any creature it can reach. If it can't attack, the otyugh uses its turn to attempt a DC 20 Strength check to break its chain while its captors are distracted.

With its childlike intellect and telepathy, the otyugh broadcasts its desire for more food. The characters are able to communicate with the creature, and if they offer to feed it, the otyugh ceases attacking for 1 round. Then the characters must periodically placate it with successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) checks. A character who frees the otyugh learns that more of its kind are in the dungeon and receives a general impression of *area 42*, where more otyughs live. All these otyughs hate the Thayans.

***Niches.*** The shallow niches are 3 feet off the floor and 5 feet high. Climbing into a niche costs 10 feet of movement.

***Dungeon State.*** If the otyugh is given a glyph key to the Prison of Filth and told how to use a black gate, it teleports to *area 41* and reaches *area 42*. Its presence there will change the characters' encounter with the other otyughs (see *area 42*).

***Glyph Key.*** The wight has a glyph key attuned to this zone and the Prison of Filth.

***White Gates.*** The corridor that leads east to *area 22* in the Hatchery contains a white gate. Another white gate is situated in the southern passage that connects with *area 21* in the Hatchery.

### Hatchery
Thayans tend and hatch the eggs of exotic monsters in these areas, rearing the young to serve Thay.

#### 21. Egg Chamber
The two approaches to this area are warm and humid.

>>Heat wafts from this chamber, and steam obscures parts of the room. Stone braziers built into the walls burn with orange flame, as do braziers in various places across the room. The floor is covered with sand, on which rest dozens of large eggs of various colors and textures.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **enchanter**, one **dread warrior**, and six **skeletons** oversee the eggs. If combat breaks out, the wizard sends the undead forward as a screen and uses targeted spells that won't harm the eggs.

***Braziers.*** The magic stone braziers are built into the room and can't be moved. A creature that touches a brazier for the first time on a turn takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.

***Eggs.*** Clusters of eggs make this area difficult terrain. None of the eggs is close to hatching. One person with a weapon could destroy all the eggs in about 5 minutes. Leaving the eggs untended also renders them lifeless. The eggs are those of an assortment of creatures, including hook horrors, remorhazes, wyverns, and basilisks, with 1d6 + 1 of each kind. Identifying a particular kind of egg requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check.

***Steam.*** Steam renders this chamber lightly obscured.

***Glyph Key.*** The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gate.*** In the corridor beyond the western exit is a white gate that separates *area 21* from the Swine Run.

#### 22. Hatchling Pens
Anyone near the doors hears the shrieking and howling of the caged creatures.

>>Relief carvings of angelic figures along the walls of this huge hall contrast with the crowded iron cages here. Half of these cells are packed with miniature, shrieking versions of deadly monsters.
>>
>>In the southeast corner is a black gate. North of the gate is a contact stone.
>>

***Aura.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals a transmutation aura on the whole area, which is a simple magical effect to control the odor of the hatchlings and their food.

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **transmuter** oversees two **Thayan apprentices** in caring for the imprisoned hatchlings, while four **Thayan warriors** stand guard. They attack intruders. In a desperate battle, the Red Wizard might take the time to release hatchlings to add to the characters' opposition.

If the battle goes badly for the Thayans, the Red Wizard surrenders. Her name is Myrja, and her allegiance to Szass Tam is less than resolute. If the characters spare her, she offers the pass phrase to get by the trap and creatures in *area 23* ("That which is dead, stay so") and one piece of lore.

***Cages.*** Half the cages here are empty. The others hold the following young monsters, which are reduced-threat creatures (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above):

**Cage A**. One **remorhaz**

**Cage B**. Two **basilisks**

**Cage C**. Five **darkmantles**

**Cage D**. Five **ettercaps**

**Cage E**. Two **carrion crawlers**

**Cage F**. One **behir** (no Constrict or Swallow traits)

**Cage G**. Two **hook horrors**

**Cage H**. One **wyvern**

Each cage has rune-scribed bars of steel. Transmutation magic on the bars renders them unbreakable, so a creature inside can't physically or magically attack through the bars. To free the occupants of a cage, a character can pick the lock on the cage door, which requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

If freed from their cages, the young attack the nearest creatures. If a Thayan and a character are equally close to a young creature, it targets the character.

***Keys.*** Myrja has a glyph key attuned to this zone. She also carries a key to each of the cages in a ring on her belt.

***White Gates.*** Area 22 is bordered by three white gates. One connects to the Swine Run, another to the Dark Gardens, and a third to the Temples of Despair.

### Dark Gardens
Once an area of deadly gardens, these chambers have been altered to support the Blood Pens.

#### 23. Dead Garden

>>Dead and blackened thorny vines cover the walls and floor, which are peppered with small, circular holes the size of a human fist.
>>
>>In the northeast corner is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** Seven **zombies** and two **wights** are focused on the doors to areas 22 and 24. Those who appear by way of the black gate can gain surprise if they attack immediately.

Unless the creatures are attacked, they grant free passage to anyone who appears to be a Thayan and knows the room's pass phrase (see *area 22*). The wights challenge those who know the phrase but look like intruders. It takes a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check to convince the wights to stand down.

***Aura.*** A *detect magic* spell cast on this area reveals an aura of transmutation magic around each hole, hinting at the presence of a magical effect.

***Blood Vines Trap.*** If a non-undead creature moves 10 feet or farther into the room without uttering the pass phrase, animated vines shoot out of the holes and into every part of the room. Each creature must say the phrase; it's not good enough for one character to say it for the whole group.

The vines ignore the undead. Any non-undead creature in the room when the vines emerge must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by a vine. A creature takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage each time it starts its turn restrained in this way. As an action, a restrained creature can free itself or another creature with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check, or free only itself with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A vine that's restraining a creature can also be cut and killed; each vine has AC 15 and 8 hit points.

While the vines are present, the area is lightly obscured and difficult terrain. A creature takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage for every 5 feet it moves through the room. A creature that moves more than 15 feet on its turn must immediately make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained as described above.

If no creature is restrained at the end of a round after the trap has been triggered, all the vines immediately die. The trap then goes dormant for 1 hour.

***Glyph Keys.*** Each of the wights has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gate.*** A white gate is located in the corridor to the west between this area and the Hatchery.

#### 24. Pale Garden
The Red Wizards use this magical garden for food.

***Light.*** The room is filled with dim light.

>>The scent of decaying plants hangs over an underground garden. White vines, trembling as if touched by an unfelt breeze, twine around cracked pillars that glow with pale light. Between the pillars, ashen flowers, sickly gray shrubs, and giant mushrooms stand in dense groves around a couple of gravel paths.
>>
>>Many baskets full of plant matter are stacked on shelves carved into the walls near the doors.
>>

***Creatures.*** Twelve unarmed humanoid **skeletons** wander the area, harvesting plant material in large baskets. As they tear off growths, a crackling sound accompanies an increase in the glow of a nearby pillar, and the harvested plant starts to rapidly regrow.

The skeletons ignore intruders unless they are attacked or damaged, in which case they all attack trespassers in the room.

Two **shambling mounds** hide in the groves, ignoring the skeletons. These creatures are trained to disregard anyone who remains within 15 feet of any doorway, where the baskets are stored on the shelves. They wait to ambush any non-undead creature that ventures any farther into the room.

***Dense Garden.*** Any area within 5 feet of a pillar and not shown on the map as part of the path is difficult terrain.

***Pillars.*** The chamber's pillars respond when plant matter in the chamber is damaged. At the end of each round during which a shambling mound took damage, a discharge of energy ripples over the pillars, and each creature within 5 feet of a pillar takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

***White Gate.*** The passage that leads west contains a white gate that connects with the Temples of Despair.

#### 25. Dreaming Garden

>>A garden courtyard fit for a palace features walls of dark marble veined with gray. The ceiling of brass is supported on black marble pillars. Between the pillars, raised stone garden beds are filled with flowers and creeping vines in every color of the rainbow, their sweet scent hanging in the air.
>>

***Creatures.*** Thuria, a Red Wizard **enchanter**, lives here and oversees the Blood Pens. Two **dread warriors** and eight robed **zombies** guard him, and a **black dragon wyrmling** is his personal pet. When the characters first arrive, the dragon has just killed a commoner.

Thuria spends much of his time in seclusion, and relishes the opportunity to fight intruders. If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, he surrenders and offers two pieces of lore in exchange for his life. He is also willing to give up his treasure and share the attunements of his glyph key, turning over the actual key only under severe threat.

***Dungeon State.*** If Thuria survives an initial encounter with the player characters, he and any surviving allies go on patrol, attacking any intruders in the Doomvault.

***Garden Beds.*** Enchantment magic imbues the garden beds. Any living humanoid that spends more than 1 minute here must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. On any successful save, the creature is immune to the effect for 24 hours. The creatures here are already immune to this effect.

***Thuria's Repose.*** The middle garden bed among the three southernmost beds is full of plants shaped like pieces of furniture. A circular shrub is a resting couch, an angular one is solid enough to use as a desk, and others nearby serve as small chairs.

***Contact Stone.*** On the southern wall near Thuria's place of repose is a circle of glowing glyphs that serves as a contact stone.

***Treasure.*** Thuria wears a gold circlet set with rubies (worth 1,000 gp) and a gold cuff (100 gp). He carries a *spell scroll* of *fly* and a *potion of healing (greater*).

One dread warrior has a *+1 longsword*, and each has a gold cuff that matches Thuria's.

In Thuria's "desk" are mundane records of important functions in the Blood Pens. Also within are *oil of etherealness* and a *potion of poison* disguised as a *potion of healing*. A bundle of entwined branches opens like a coffer to reveal 100 pp and a diamond (worth 1,000 gp).

***Glyph Key.*** Thuria has a glyph key attuned to this zone, the Vermin Halls, the Swine Run, the Hatchery, and the Temples of Turmoil (in the Temples of Extraction sector).

***White Gate.*** Beyond the exit to the south, a white gate lies in the corridor that leads to the Hall of Necromancy.

## Masters' Domain
This sector is the central sanctum of the Red Wizards in charge of the Doomvault.

Locations in the Masters' Domain are identified on map 5.5.

![[008-dit05.png|right|300]]

### Temples of Despair
Although the chambers in this zone are referred to as "temples," they are essentially security rooms designed to destroy the unwary.

***Doors.*** All the doors in this zone are locked.

***Aura.*** Divine Sense and *detect evil and good* reveal that this zone is thoroughly desecrated.

#### 26. Temple of Light

>>Glowing pillars brightly light this chamber of white marble. Each pillar is carved in the likeness of a smiling figure with its hands held out, as if ready to accept an offering.
>>
>>In contrast to the beatific pillars, alcoves around the room contain statues of four-armed gargoyles.
>>

***Advance Notice.*** Characters who enter this area feel tranquility despite the gargoyles. If a player expresses doubt about the impression, that player's character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful check, the character realizes that the emotion is artificial and illusory.

***Creatures.*** When the characters first enter this area, the eight four-armed gargoyles are true statues. After a door other than a secret door is opened in this area, four **four-armed gargoyles** (as normal **gargoyles** with 63 hit points and one extra claw attack, for a total of three attacks, with Multiattack) animate and attack. Another four-armed gargoyle animates whenever another such door is opened. This process continues for as long as any gargoyles remain in the alcoves. The gargoyles don't leave the room.

***Pillars of Light.*** Seeming to offer a measure of protective power, the pillars have magic designed to prolong the torment of those trapped here. When a creature touches a pillar, the room pulses with light, and that creature gains 5 temporary hit points. Any slain gargoyle disappears when the light pulses, and a new statue appears in an empty alcove. This light pulses spontaneously once an hour, replenishing the gargoyles even if no one is present.

***Body.*** Sprawled in front of one alcove, in a location where the characters see it only after entering the room, is the red-robed form of a male human. Vorja, a Red Wizard sent here to face execution, fell to the gargoyles but became stabilized after being left for dead. It takes healing magic or a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check to bring him back to consciousness. He has only 1 hit point unless healing magic was used. Vorja is in no condition to fight, and his loyalty to Thay is tenuous.

If assisted, Vorja can reveal one piece of lore along with descriptions of the Hall of Obedience and the Hall of Necromancy. He knows nothing about this zone. If he is given a glyph key and taken to the black gate, he escapes the Doomvault and joins Syranna's forces.

***Dungeon State.*** The nature of this area means the gargoyles can't be permanently slain.

***White Gates.*** A white gate lies in the corridor to the north that connects with the Hatchery. Another white gate is in the eastern passage between this area and the Dark Gardens.

#### 27. Temple of Shadow
A creature near the doors into this area hears a faint moaning that rises in intensity as the creature moves closer to the doors.

>>A wailing howl erupts from the shadows of this dim chamber, echoing from black marble walls. Dark pillars rise to the ceiling, each exuding shadow that twists in the air like smoke. Alcoves around the room hold statues of four-armed gargoyles shrouded in darkness.
>>

***Light.*** Dim light radiates from the pillars and fills the area. Any light source brought into or created in the room radiates only dim light unless it is a spell of 3rd level or higher.

***Wailing.*** Pervading the chamber is a horrid wailing that has unnerving effects on non-undead creatures that hear it. Such creatures have disadvantage on melee attack rolls, Strength checks, and Dexterity checks. A character can take an action to make a DC 14 Wisdom check or Charisma check. On a successful check, the character can ignore the effect for 10 minutes.

***Creatures.*** Shadows swirling around a pillar coalesce into a **wraith** after a door other than a secret door is opened in this area. Another wraith emerges from another pillar each round thereafter, until eight undead have appeared. The undead don't leave the room.

***Pillars of Shadow.*** The pillars here are imbued with necromancy magic. An undead creature that touches (or passes through) the pillar gains 5 temporary hit points. A non-undead creature that touches a pillar takes 5 (1d10) necrotic damage and 5 (1d10) cold damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

***Black Gate.*** The space beyond the western false door contains a black gate.

***Contact Stone.*** A contact stone is on the wall near the black gate.

#### 28. Temple of Blood

>>The coppery scent of blood hangs heavy in the air in this chamber of dark red marble. Pools of blood are spread across the floor around several dimly glowing red pillars that give off wispy vapors. Statues of four-armed gargoyles, each with mouths and claws dripping blood, stand in alcoves around the chamber.
>>

***Light.*** Dim, blood-red light radiates from the pillars and fills the area.

***Blood.*** Due to the slick blood on the floor, a creature that moves across the ground at greater than half its normal speed must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

***Creatures.*** The vapor swirling around two of the pillars coalesces into a pair of **vampiric mists** after a door other than a secret door is opened in this area. Another vampiric mist appears whenever another such door is opened. This process continues until eight of the creatures have manifested.

***Pillars of Blood.*** If a living humanoid creature touches a pillar, the part of its body that touched the pillar becomes stuck, and the creature is restrained. At the start of each of its turns, the restrained creature is drained of blood and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) necrotic damage and have its hit point maximum reduced by the amount of the damage until the creature finishes a long rest. With a successful DC 15 Strength check, a creature can use an action to escape the pillar's hold, or another creature can use an action to pull a victim free.

***White Gates.*** Two white gates adjoin *area 28*. One is in the south passage that leads to the Hall of Obedience, and the other is in the eastern corridor that connects with the Hall of Necromancy.

### Hall of Obedience
The Red Wizards use the magic of the Hall of Obedience to create zealous followers.

#### 29. Conditioning Court

>>Doors surround a central courtyard here, creating the sense of a monastic sanctuary. Each of the glowing silver pillars that support the ceiling has a set of chains and manacles fastened to it. Thayans hang from four of the pillars, their seemingly dead eyes open wide as if in a state of intense focus.
>>

***Silver Pillars.*** Exuding enchantment magic that dulls will and perception, the silver pillars cause any creature in the courtyard to have disadvantage on Wisdom checks and saving throws. Being chained to the pillars causes hypnotic dreams that, after a period of weeks or months, improve combat skill and imbue most creatures with strong devotion to the Red Wizards.

Four **Thayan warriors** chained to the pillars are in an advanced state of entrancement. They can be treated as unconscious. If they are slain, a gong sounds in the chamber, alerting the inhabitants of the cells.

***Cells.*** Several of the cells are quarters for Thayans who train and work here. Unless otherwise noted, each cell contains rough cots and footlockers that hold worthless personal possessions.

Any commotion in the area, or the sounding of the gong, alerts those in the cells. The Red Wizard emerges 1 round later, and the **Thayan apprentice** comes out during the following round. The residents of the other cells take 1d4 + 1 rounds to respond (roll separately for each).

The occupants of the cells are as follows:

**Cell A**. A Red Wizard **illusionist** dwells in this fine chamber with one **Thayan apprentice**. The wizard is half asleep. Both have glyph keys attuned to the zone, as well as keys to the C cells. In combat, the apprentice uses an action to open the occupied C cell if able to do so without significant risk.

**Cell B**. Two **Thayan warriors** sleep in each of four small rooms. The B cells marked with an asterisk are empty.

**Cell C**. The doors to these two cells are locked. Four **Thayan warriors** are held in one of them when it's not their turn to be shackled to the silver pillars. The other C cell is empty.

**Cell D**. This cell contains bunks but is empty.

***Black Gate.*** The space beyond the secret door in the southeast corner contains a black gate.

***White Gates.*** The corridors that exit this area to the north and the east have white gates that connect with the Temples of Despair and the Hall of Necromancy.

#### 30. Training Floor

>>An arsenal of weapons and armor hangs from the walls in this broad chamber, the floor of which is stained with blood and black ichor. On the wall between two weapon racks to the east is a contact stone.
>>

![[009-totyp-05-10.png|right|300]]

***Creatures.*** **Lahnis**, a Red Wizard **evoker**, directs the brutal combat training here. Six **Thayan warriors** engage a **dread warrior** and seven **skeletons**. **Lahnis** orders the whole lot to attack intruders. Because they have been engaged in combat, each creature aside from **Lahnis** starts with current hit points equal to half its hit point maximum.

**Lahnis** initially stays back in combat, using lower-level spells and trying to assess the characters' motivations. His allegiance to Szass Tam has been flagging. He leans toward supporting the Thayan rebels, but he has not formally joined their ranks. He worries that some of his peers who are loyal to Szass Tam might suspect him.

Aware of Szass Tam's cunning, **Lahnis** first assumes the characters are testing his allegiance. Around the second round of combat, or if reduced to half his hit points or fewer, **Lahnis** directly asks the characters their purpose and admits a willingness to join the rebels. The characters can sway him with convincing talk and proof that they have overcome other parts of the dungeon. If the characters earn his trust, **Lahnis** turns against Szass Tam, having become convinced that the regent's plots will be the undoing of Thay.

He then turns on the Thayans here, whom he knows won't stand down, and helps the characters fight. Afterward, **Lahnis** provides two pieces of lore and the attunements on his glyph key, as well as his physical keys. He goes to the gatehouse through the black gate in *area 29*.

***Treasure.*** Among the weapons here are a *+1 battleaxe*, a *+1 greatsword*, and a *+1 shortbow*. A heavily scarred suit of plate armor here is *armor of vulnerability* (your choice of type). In addition, **Lahnis** wears a *ring of protection*.

***Keys.*** **Lahnis** carries a glyph key attuned to this zone, the Hall of Necromancy, and the Temples of Despair. He also carries a key that safely opens all the doors in the Temples of Despair, as well as a key to open the C cells in *area 29*.

***Development.*** If **Lahnis** joins the rebels, he provides information that decreases the Doomvault's alert level by 1.

### Hall of Necromancy
Red Wizards practice and refine their darkest magic in the Hall of Necromancy.

#### 31. Undying Laboratory
If **Phaia** and Kelson are here (see "Creatures" below), anyone who listens at the doors can hear screaming coming from the other side.

>>The walls of this black marble mausoleum are lined with hundreds of niches, each holding an ivory urn set with gold, silver, and precious gems. A dozen gray marble tables arrayed across the floor are encrusted with blood and ichor.
>>
>>In the north side of the room is a black gate.
>>

![[010-totyp-05-11a.png|right|300]]

***Creatures.*** **Phaia**, a Red Wizard **necromancer**, is drawing the soul from **Kelson Darktreader**, a male half-elf lying on a stone table farthest from the door the characters use to enter. Kelson is unconscious and stable at 0 hit points. **Phaia**'s magic is drawing forth from his body a wispy shape that resembles him, and this shape screams in an echoing voice. Strands of energy flow from the shape into the table and from there into other forms in the room.

A **deathlock wight** on a nearby table is a Red Wizard in the process of being raised as undead. Also nearby, two **wights** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) are being raised as warrior undead. These wights are only partially animated, so they respond only to **Phaia** when she orders an attack. One of them tries to throw an urn at a character each round (+4 to hit, range 10 feet/20 feet; one creature). A hit deals 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make saving throws as noted in the "Urns" section. **Phaia** stays for a round or two to assess the party's capabilities and then moves to *area 32* or uses the black gate in the room.

As a faithful servant of Szass Tam, **Phaia** follows the lich lord's philosophy that no magic is too dangerous and no experiment too dark if it promises power. Lawful evil, **Phaia** is as opportunistic as she is wicked.

She does anything she can to save herself from death, including using Szass Tam's secrets. She can reveal two pieces of lore and is willing to share her glyph key's attunements. Further, she can teach the characters the ritual that uses this area's magic to return soul-bound undead characters to life.

If she is allowed to do so, **Phaia** flees the Doomvault.

***Aura.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of necromancy on the whole area, signifying the magic that helps in the creation of undead. Divine Sense and *detect evil and good* reveal that this area is desecrated.

***Stone Tables.*** These 3-foot-high carved slabs channel the energy of life and undeath. They aid in rituals and spells to create undead.

With the proper knowledge, a creature can use the stone tables to transform a soul-bound character back into a normal creature. Doing so requires the aid of a Red Wizard or explicit written instruction, such as the scroll in **Lahnis**'s room in *area 32*. The ritual takes 20 minutes and requires a spellcaster to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The spellcaster must also expend a 3rd-level spell slot. On a successful check, the soul-bound creature returns to normal with all of its Hit Dice expended. On a failed check, the spell slot is expended but the creature remains soul bound.

![[011-totyp-05-11.png|right|300]]

***Urns.*** The urns are magic and worthless but clever fakes that appear valuable, requiring a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the truth. Any non-undead creature that touches an urn must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (creature's choice) or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and become paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies and turns to dust.

***Kelson.*** Despite his ordeal, **Kelson Darktreader** can be restored to health through normal means, although he is in no condition to help. He thanks the characters for saving him and offers two pieces of lore. He asks for a glyph key and goes to the gatehouse to recuperate.

***Treasure.*** **Phaia** carries a *+1 dagger*, a *spell scroll* of *darkvision*, and a *potion of water breathing*.

***Glyph Key.*** **Phaia** has a glyph key attuned to this zone and the Temples of Oppression (in the Temples of Extraction sector).

***White Gates.*** The corridor that leads west has a white gate that connects with the Temples of Despair. In the northern leg of the corridor to the east is another white gate that leads to the Dark Gardens.

#### 32. Wizards' Court

>>A stepped monument of gray marble shot through with red dominates an open courtyard surrounded by closed doors. Blue light shines from the top of the monument. The air around it hums with power, its vibration overwhelming other sensations. Red Wizards and other Thayans kneel on the lower two tiers, eyes fixed on the monument.
>>

***Stepped Monument.*** The monument amplifies magic in the courtyard, but those in the area have trouble with physical sensations and tasks, and they have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws. Meditating on the monument causes hypnotic dreams that, after a period of weeks or months, improve spellcasting capabilities and imbue most creatures with strong devotion to the Red Wizards.

Each tier of the monument is 5 feet high, and clambering onto it requires 5 extra feet of movement.

***Creatures.*** Three **Thayan apprentices** kneel on the lower tier of the monument. The Thayans attack intruders.

***Cells.*** The cells around the perimeter of the court (rooms labeled A through D on the map) are quarters for Thayans who train and work here. Unless otherwise noted, each cell contains rough cots and footlockers holding worthless personal possessions. Cells marked with an asterisk on the map are empty.

Combat in the courtyard alerts the inhabitants of the cells. They take 1d4 + 1 rounds to respond (roll for each one):

**Cell A**. **Lahnis** (see *area 30*) uses these quarters, which contain a fine bed, a footlocker, and a desk. Searching the area uncovers one written piece of lore, as well as a *tome of the stilled tongue* and six *spell scrolls* (two each of *detect magic*, *identify*, and *remove curse*). **Lahnis** also has a scroll describing the ritual used to turn soul-bound undead back into non-undead creatures in *area 31*.

**Cell B**. One Red Wizard **evoker** sleeps here.

**Cell C**. One **Thayan apprentice** sleeps here.

**Cell D**. Each of these two rooms is a library. An hour spent examining a library's contents turns up two pieces of lore.

***Contact Stone.*** Atop the monument is a circle of glowing glyphs that serves as a contact stone.

***Glyph Key.*** The Red Wizard in cell B has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gates.*** Two white gates separate *area 32* from other zones. The gate in the corridor to the west leads to the Hall of Obedience. Beyond the doors to the south is a gate that connects with the Dread Legion Outpost.

### Dread Legion Outpost
The Dread Legion, Thay's army, maintains a full company in the Doomvault.

#### 33. Cavern Guard Post

>>Glowing crystals set into the walls and floors light a rough stone cavern. To the south is a black gate.
>>

***Blue Crystals.*** The blue crystals brightly light the area.

***Creatures.*** One **Thayan warrior**, five **gnolls**, and five **orcs** attack intruders on sight.

***Glyph Key.*** The **Thayan warrior** has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

#### 34. Shard Cavern
This cavern has no light.

>>The walls and ceiling of this rough cavern are a mass of rock spines, the floor covered with rock dust and shards. A path has been worn through the rubble, winding between double doors to the west and a rough flight of stairs rising to the larger and lit open space to the east.
>>

***Path.*** Except on the path, the ground in the room is difficult terrain.

***Shard Storm Trap.*** Transmutation magic infuses the room. Any creature that spends more than 1 round in this area triggers the trap. When the trap triggers, each creature in the room who isn't wearing a Thayan uniform must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) piercing damage from flying shards on a failed save, or only half as much damage on a successful one. This effect repeats every round until the room is empty, when the trap resets.

The path becomes difficult terrain, and if the creatures in areas 33 and 35 can hear the trap go off, the guards have warning that intruders are in the area.

***Stone Wall.*** A rough stone wall separates the lower cavern of *area 34* from the higher finished chamber of *area 35*. The wall is 15 feet high.

#### 35. Dread Legion Barracks
The light in this room can be seen from *area 34*. Unless the creatures here have a reason to be quiet, they are talking loudly.

>>Three bonfires light this vast chamber, their smoke rising to vent through cracks in the ceiling. Scattered bedding and the stench of unwashed humanoids suggest that many creatures might dwell here.
>>
>>In the east, on the wall between two oversized bedrolls, is a contact stone.
>>

***Bonfires.*** Large fires brightly light this area. A creature that enters a bonfire for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn in a fire, takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.

***Creatures.*** Resting in this chamber are a **Thayan warrior** and a Dread Legion squad made up of five **orcs** and five **gnolls**. A **troll** is on post here to keep the other legionnaires in line.

***Stone Wall.*** See *area 34*.

***Dungeon State.*** The Dread Legion patrols throughout the Doomvault. If a squad resting in the barracks is slain, an identical squad arrives here within 1 hour.

***Glyph Keys.*** The **Thayan warrior** has a glyph key attuned to every zone in this sector. The troll has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gates.*** A white gate is located in the corridor to the south, leading to the Warren of Eyes. Another white gate is in the passage to the north that connects with the Hall of Necromancy.

## Far Realm Cysts
The influence of the Far Realm has warped a portion of the Doomvault, where several star-shaped chambers have been turned into a weird mix of worked stone and glistening walls. Unless otherwise noted, these caverns are dark.

Locations in the Far Realm Cysts are identified on map 5.6.

![[012-dit06.png|right|300]]

### Lake of Madness
An aboleth dwells in a watery crevasse, seething at its imprisonment and hungry to enslave the living.

#### 36. Dark Water
Water can be heard rippling in this dark area before the characters arrive.

>>The walls of this cavern are the same dark shade of blue as the pool of water that fills the center of the area. Ripples spread across the surface as if the water has been recently disturbed. Around the cavern, narrow alcoves hold enormous globes of blue liquid suspended in the air.
>>
>>In the west side of the room is a black gate, and on the wall near it is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** One **reduced-threat aboleth** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) dwells deep in the pool. Within this room, the aboleth can use the water globes (see "Water Globes" below) to move around.

The aboleth's ordeal in the Doomvault has weakened it, making it a reduced threat. In addition, its hatred of the Red Wizards makes the aboleth a potential ally. With a successful DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, or another successful and appropriate check, a character can convince the aboleth to stand down and negotiate. In exchange for sparing the characters, the aboleth demands to be freed and given a glyph key.

***Pool.*** Over 350 feet deep, this pool has sheer sides that drop to its bottom. The water within 10 feet of the surface is a lightly obscured area, and deeper water is heavily obscured.

***Water Globes.*** Floating 5 feet above the floor, these magic water globes are 15 feet in diameter. Red Wizards use them to hold aquatic creatures for transport through the black gates.

As an action, a creature that is within 5 feet of a globe and has an Intelligence score of 10 or higher can take control of the globe by succeeding on a DC 10 Intelligence check. As part of its movement and with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check, the controller can direct the globe to move with it, remaining within 5 feet of the controller. A globe's controller can enter and leave the globe at will. The controller can maintain control of the globe while within 100 feet of it. Another creature that qualifies as a controller can gain control of a globe by winning a contest of Intelligence checks against the current controller.

A creature that touches a globe but isn't its controller must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be drawn into the globe and unable to pass back through its boundary. As an action, a trapped creature can free itself with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. Also as an action, a globe's controller can release a trapped creature with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. A creature inside a globe has half cover against effects that originate outside the globe. While inside a globe, a trapped creature can't contest for control of the globe.

***Dungeon State.*** If the characters free the aboleth, it wanders the dungeon and attacks anyone it runs across.

***White Gate.*** A white gate lies in the east–west corridor between this area and the Warren of Eyes.

#### 37. Compelling Light
***Light.*** The dim light that fills the chamber can be seen before the room can.

>>Dim light dances in the air, shimmering through the colors of the rainbow, gently lighting the walls of this cavern. A few piles of bones and scraps of gear litter the floor.
>>

***Creatures.*** The shimmering light here has affected two **wights**, two **dread warriors**, and six **zombies**. They attack if the trap's effect on them ends.

***Compelling Light Trap.*** Any creature that sees the magical light while within this area must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or enter the cavern and stand there while ignoring all other stimuli. When an affected creature takes damage, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. Any non-undead creature that ends its turn in the lighted room takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

A *dispel magic* spell suppresses the light's effect for 10 minutes. Any spell that overwhelms or blocks the light also suppresses it in the spell's area for the duration of the spell.

***Glyph Key.*** One of the dread warriors has a glyph key attuned to the Forest of Death.

***White Gate.*** A white gate lies at the foot of the stairs leading west toward the Forest of Death.

### Warren of Eyes
**Thaxalia**, a beholder, has been summoned and imprisoned here.

***Light.*** This zone is bathed in a weird green glow that provides dim illumination.

#### 38. Sinkhole Cavern

>>This rough cavern has an uneven floor with open holes in it. In the east, on a spar of rock, is a contact stone.
>>

If the characters come from the north, add the following.

>>Southwest of the doors is an alcove that contains a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** Eight **zombies** and two **ogre zombies** attack any intruders. Any combat warns **Thaxalia** (*area 39*) of the approach of intruders.

***Sinkholes.*** These open sinkholes are 5 feet across and 10 feet deep. A creature that falls into a sinkhole is restrained in the narrow bottom. It takes a successful DC 13 Strength check or Dexterity check to work free, and a Small creature has advantage on this check. It's then an easy matter to climb out of the sinkhole.

***White Gate.*** The passage that leads west has a white gate that connects with the Lake of Madness.

#### 39. Beholder's Domain

>>Hundreds of unblinking eyes stare into this room from long walls of glistening green stone. The floor of this chamber is covered with viscous slime that drips from four stalagmites.
>>

***Beholder.*** **Thaxalia**, a reduced-threat **beholder** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) crippled by Thayan magic, floats near the ceiling, trying to remain unnoticed while intruders enter. Thaxalia's central eye and two of its eyestalks have been maimed by the Red Wizards, rendering those eye rays (death ray and disintegration) powerless. If it has warning or is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, it withdraws to *area 40*, leaving its spawn to deal with the threat.

After only 2 rounds, Thaxalia's hatred for the Red Wizards inspires the beholder to question the characters' purpose in the dungeon. If they reveal their goals, the beholder suggests an alliance, extolling its plans for revenge.

Fearing Thaxalia's ability to wreak havoc if it escapes this zone, the Red Wizards cursed the beholder with the inability to use glyph keys. Thaxalia doesn't know the solution, but a *remove curse* spell can eliminate the prohibition. The beholder then takes a glyph key from the wight in *area 40* and asks the characters to provide it with more attunements. If refused, it becomes hostile and uses its powers to compel the characters to give it more attunements.

***Beholder Spawn.*** Clinging to the cavern walls by the hundreds, between this world and the Far Realm, are the manifestations of beholder spawn. These spawn aren't independent creatures, but they can project weak eye rays that function as an area hazard. At the start of each of its turns, any creature other than Thaxalia in the cavern must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of the following effects, rolled randomly.

| 2d4 | Eye Ray |
|:---:|---|
| 2–3 | *Charm*. For its turn, the target moves toward its nearest ally and attacks with a weapon or a cantrip. The target can't check for danger as it moves. |
| 4–5 | *Telekinesis*. The target is pushed 5 feet in a random direction and falls prone. |
| 6–7 | *Slow*. Until the start of its next turn, the target's speed is reduced by 15 feet, and others make attack rolls against the target with advantage. |
| 8 | *Sleep*. The target falls unconscious until the start of its next turn. |

***Slime.*** Covering the rough floor is 1 foot of thick slime, which is difficult terrain and covers several hidden sinkholes. Any creature that starts its turn prone in or submerged in the slime takes 4 (1d8) poison damage.

***Sinkholes.*** These open sinkholes are 5 feet across and 10 feet deep, and they are filled with slime. While moving near a sinkhole, a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Perception check notices the hazard due to the flow of slime in and around it. A creature that falls into a sinkhole is restrained in the narrow bottom and submerged in slime, unable to breathe. It takes a successful DC 15 Strength check or Dexterity check to work free, and a Small creature has advantage on this check. It then takes a successful DC 10 Strength check to climb out of the sinkhole.

***Stalagmites.*** These 10-foot-diameter spires of rock rise 20 feet above the floor and exude the otherworldly slime. Their sides are slick and smooth, difficult to climb.

***Dungeon State.*** If freed and given a glyph key, Thaxalia allows the characters free passage through this area. While Thaxalia is free in the Doomvault, it prefers to attack Thayans. If encountered again, the beholder might help the characters, given incentives.

The beholder spawn in this area are no longer a threat to those who freed Thaxalia. If Thaxalia is destroyed, the beholder spawn here disappear.

#### 40. Slime Slaves

>>Viscous slime covers this chamber. Rough stone steps lead up and out.
>>

If **Thaxalia** left *area 39*, the beholder is in this location. It has been picking off Thayan patrols here. Amid the slime are five bodies: two of wights and three of Thayan warriors.

***Slime.*** Covering the rough floor is 1 foot of thick slime. Any creature that starts its turn prone in the slime takes 4 (1d8) poison damage.

***Glyph Key.*** One wight corpse has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gate.*** A white gate lies in the corridor to the west, leading into the Prison of Filth.

### Prison of Filth
A pack of otyughs has been imprisoned here to reproduce in the filth.

***Light. None.*** ***Necrotic Essence.*** Viewed with *detect magic*, the area has an aura of necromancy. When non-undead creatures regain hit points in this zone, they regain only half as many.

#### 41. Garbage Transfer

>>This rough-walled cavern contains nothing that should make it stink of filth and rot as it does.
>>
>>Shadows curl like smoke from the walls. To the northeast, similar shadows whirl around a black gate. East of it is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** Twenty unarmed **skeletons** stand here, waiting to cart refuse that arrives from other areas through the black gate. They attack only if attacked.

If a character drops any moderate-sized object in front of the skeletons, as many of them as needed quickly seize the object and carry it into *area 42*. The otyughs are distracted while the skeletons move through *area 42*.

***Doors.*** Abjuration magic on these locked doors causes them to open if an animate skeleton touches them.

***Dungeon State.*** Unless destroyed with radiant damage, the skeletons here reassemble within 1 minute of being destroyed. Restored skeletons have no memory of their previous fate, so they attack only if attacked or if they witness other skeletons under attack.

#### 42. Otyugh Lair

>>Pools and piles of rotting garbage, offal, and filth cover the rough stone floor of this cavern. The air is heavy with an unbearable stench. Four stalagmites thrust up from the floor.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **otyughs** and two **reduced-threat otyughs** young (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) hide in the trash here. The reduced-threat monsters can't restrain with tentacles or use Tentacle Slam. The otyughs attack right away unless the otyugh from *area 20* is here, in which case it may convince them to delay or even negotiate with the characters (depending on how the previous encounter went).

The otyughs use their telepathy to demand food like peevish children. If the characters offer to feed them, the otyughs stop fighting to see if the party is telling the truth (unless the party has slain one of the young). If the characters have killed one of the young, it takes a successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check to get the otyughs to stand down.

***Stench.*** At the start of each of its turns in this area, any non-undead creature that isn't an otyugh must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be overpowered by the stench. On a failed save, a creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this stench for 1 hour.

***Trash.*** The waste in the area is difficult terrain.

***Stalagmites.*** These 10-foot-diameter spires of rock rise 20 feet above the floor.

***Dungeon State.*** If the otyughs are freed and given a glyph key, they go rampaging through the dungeon, devouring anything in their path, including Red Wizards.

***White Gates.*** The open passages that lead away from *area 42* both contain white gates. The northern route leads to the Warren of Eyes, and the southern path goes to the Caverns of Chaos.

#### 43. Summoning Chamber

>>A blood-red circle is scribed on the floor of this cavern, the twisted runes around its edge pulsing with sickly purple light.
>>

A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check allows a character to recognize the runes as symbols of dangerous magic that can be manipulated to call forth creatures of the Far Realm. The character further knows that using the summoning circle is impossible without the proper rituals, and that it can be disabled by defacing particular runes. The character is also aware that the process could unleash weird forces. Defacing the runes requires the use of a weapon or tools, such as thieves' tools, and a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Each time a character tries to disable the circle and fails, the circle unleashes a pulse of magical power that forces each creature in the area to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or suffer a severe break with reality. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on all Intelligence checks, Wisdom checks, and Charisma checks. In addition, the creature has disadvantage when rolling initiative and can't maintain concentration. *Remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or equivalent magic restores the creature to normal, as does finishing a long rest.

***White Gate.*** A white gate stands in the passage that leads to the Forest of Weakness.

### Caverns of Chaos
The creatures and forces of the Far Realm are held in these unlit caverns.

#### 44. Chaos Lair

>>Twisting ledges divide this chamber into multiple sections, creating a series of increasingly deep tiers. Stalagmites dot the floor.
>>

***Advance Notice.*** Those entering this area can hear the babble of the gibbering mouthers. A successful DC 10 Intelligence check confirms that the speech is gibberish in various languages.

***Ceiling.*** Although the cavern floor steps down to the east as shown on the map, the ceiling stays level.

***Creatures.*** Four **gricks** climb and wander on the top two steps, while two **gibbering mouthers** lurk on the third. One **grell** starts out flying above *area 45*. Six prisoners hide among the ledges, trying to avoid the aberrant monsters.

***Aberrant Magic Field.*** Weird transmutation magic radiates from the entire cavern. Whenever a character gets a failure on an attack roll, a saving throw, or a check in this area, all the character's ongoing spells and magic items are suppressed until the end of the character's next turn. During this time, spells provide no effect and items don't impart their properties or powers.

***Ledges.*** Each rough ledge is 10 feet high and easy to scale.

***Stalagmites.*** These 10-foot-diameter spires of rock rise 20 feet above the floor.

***Black Gate.*** A black gate is set into the western alcove, not immediately visible from the entrance.

***White Gate.*** The exit from this area contains a white gate that connects with the Prison of Filth.

#### 45. Eldritch Altar

>>A slab of jet-black stone sits at the center of this cavern alcove. Its sides show relief carvings of familiar humanoid faces—your own.
>>
>>On the wall east of the altar is a contact stone.
>>

***Altar.*** This ancient altar to chaos is imbued with transmutation magic that reshapes its sides to show the faces of the most recent sentient humanoids to enter *area 44*.

The top of the altar slab shows the shadowy outlines of a dozen weapons, pendants, and other objects. An *identify* spell reveals that the altar imparts additional power into magic items placed on its surface. The caster must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to further discern that when an item is empowered, the altar also draws in the life force of creatures near it.

When any magic item is placed on the altar for 1 minute, it takes on the following features:

- The item glows with dim purple light out to a radius of 5 feet.
- The item periodically and randomly alters its appearance in slight ways. The bearer has no control over these minor transformations, which don't affect the item's use or magical properties.
- The owner can communicate telepathically with the creature whose soul was consumed (see below).

When a magic item is transformed, randomly select one character within 50 feet of the altar. That person's soul is drawn into the item, and he or she drops into a deathlike coma, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check to realize that the victim is still alive. An *identify* spell can be used to discern the whereabouts of the soul and how to cure the condition, temporarily or permanently.

Placing the transformed magic item in the victim's hand temporarily ends the coma. Thereafter, the character must continue to hold the object in hand or fall into a coma again. If the character breaks contact with the object for 1 hour, or if the object is destroyed, the character dies. *Remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or equivalent magic breaks the bond, returning the soul to its rightful place.

## Forests of Slaughter
These caverns house a Thayan menagerie.

Locations in the Forests of Slaughter are identified on map 5.7.

![[013-dit07.png|right|300]]

***Light.*** The cavern ceilings glow with magical light that varies in 12-hour cycles to simulate day and night. When the characters arrive, it is the start of the night cycle, and all areas of this sector are in dim light.

***Magic Trees.*** Isolated stands of gnarled and vine-choked trees rise 15 to 20 feet high in the caverns. The trees are magic, having different powers in each zone, and targeting any intruders—creatures that aren't normally housed in the area. An area of trees is difficult terrain.

***Magic Turf.*** The rocky cavern floors in this sector are covered in a layer of magic turf that uses transmutation magic to slowly absorb the waste of the creatures that dwell here.

***Pools.*** Each of the rocky pools in these caverns is 1 foot deep and magically filled with cool, clean water. A pool is difficult terrain.

### Forest of Illusion
Powerful illusion magic suffuses the trees in this zone. When an intruder ends its turn in an area of trees, the creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes unable for 1 minute to see creatures hostile to itself. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

#### 46. Hook Horror Nest

>>The turf here is full of deep, enormous gouges.
>>

***Advance Warning.*** A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check can identify the gouges and tracks in the area as belonging to Large bipedal predators that use oversized clawed forelimbs to move like a gorilla might. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check recognizes the traits of hook horrors.

***Creatures.*** Four **hook horrors** hang from the walls here. They have grown lazy and distracted by their imprisonment, so characters have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made against the horrors until any character is spotted. The horrors hesitate to attack those dressed like Thayans but do so if no food is quickly offered.

The horrors fight mostly to defend a mound in the northwest section of the cavern, which contains their eggs. A character who can speak Undercommon and deal with the hook horrors' unsophisticated intellect can get them to stand down by guaranteeing the eggs' safety and making a successful DC 20 Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check. If the check fails, the horrors try to kill and eat the interlopers, but the negotiations can be renewed if two or more horrors are slain.

***Black Gate.*** A black gate is set into the northeastern edge of the area, not immediately visible from the entrance.

***Contact Stone.*** A contact stone is on the wall just north of the black gate.

***Dungeon State.*** The hook horrors recognize a truce for only about 10 minutes. At that point, intruders have to renegotiate.

***White Gate.*** The passage to the northeast contains a white gate that offers access to the Immortal Caverns.

#### 47. Cockatrice Roost

>>This treeless section of the cavern is set with natural ledges and indentations ten feet from the floor.
>>

***Creatures.*** Eight **cockatrices** roost on the ledges. They make no attempt to hide, and they attack as soon as they realize the characters have no food for them.

***Ledges.*** Rough handholds make it easy to climb the walls in this area. A search of the ledges reveals sixteen cockatrice eggs.

#### 48. Gorgon Lair

>>At the pool's edge is a lifelike statue of a hook horror.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two adult **gorgons** attack intruders on sight, pursuing those who flee into *area 46*. Any hook horrors there attack only if the intruders slay or drive off the gorgons.

***White Gate.*** A white gate is situated in the opening in the rock wall that leads to the Forest of Recovery.

### Forest of Recovery
Powerful conjuration magic suffuses the trees in this zone. When an intruder ends its turn in an area of trees, the creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, any damage the creature deals for 1 minute instead causes the target to gain 5 (1d10) temporary hit points per successful attack. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

#### 49. Gate Cavern

>>Trees crowd the walls of this turfed cavern. To the southwest the turf gives way to a stone floor, where shadows curl up like smoke from a black gate. West of the gate is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** A **helmed horror** and a **wight** guard this area. The wight has orders to confront anyone who comes through the gate without pig carcasses or other items to feed to the zone's monsters. If such interlopers can't provide credible reasons for their presence, the wight orders the helmed horror to attack.

***Glyph Key.*** The wight has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

#### 50. Barghest Range

>>The grassy turf grows high in this large cavern.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **barghests** lurk in the tall grass. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check spots one or more of them. These creatures hesitate to attack only if the characters seem to be Thayans.

The barghests want to take revenge on the Red Wizards and then escape the Doomvault. If the characters offer to free them and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma check (any appropriate Charisma skill can apply), the fiends stand down. They want any glyph keys the characters have. If they are defied, the barghests are likely to renew their attacks.

***Development.*** If the barghests are freed and given a glyph key, they stalk the dungeon for any prey they can find.

***White Gate.*** A white gate is located in the opening in the rock wall that leads to the Forest of Illusion.

#### 51. Pool of Recovery

>>A pool in this cavern glows with pale blue light.
>>

The pool's magic grants non-undead creatures that drink from it the benefits of finishing a short rest. A creature can drink from the pool safely only once per tenday. The second time the creature drinks in a tenday, its hit point maximum is halved for one tenday (*remove curse* negates this effect). The third time the creature drinks in a tenday, it suffers the effects of a *harm* spell (save DC 15).

It isn't safe for an undead to drink from the pool. If the undead does, it gains no benefits and takes 22 (4d10) radiant damage.

***White Gate.*** A white gate stands in the opening in the wall between this area and the Forest of Weakness.

#### 52. Displacer Beast Dens

>>Bones are piled against the western walls of this cavern, forming low mounds.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two adult **displacer beasts** dwell here with three **reduced-threat displacer beasts** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above). Each creature sits atop a different bone mound, and they all attack when it becomes clear that the characters have not brought food.

***Bone Piles.*** These 1-foot-high piles of bones are difficult terrain.

***White Gates.*** The northern exit from this area has a white gate that connects with the Culling Pens. The opening to the east has a white gate that leads to the Forest of Death.

### Forest of Death
Powerful necromancy magic suffuses the trees in this zone. When an intruder ends its turn in an area of trees, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't regain hit points for 10 minutes.

#### 53. Peryton Roost

>>Broad ledges run along the walls of this long cavern, twenty feet above the floor.
>>

***Creatures.*** The four adult **perytons** and four **reduced-threat perytons** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) that roost here have grown tired of their pork diet. If the characters don't appear to be Thayans, or if they fail to offer food within a few moments, the perytons attack.

***Ledges.*** Rough handholds make it easy to climb the walls in this area. A search of the ledges reveals five peryton eggs.

***White Gates.*** The southern passage has a white gate that leads to the Forest of Recovery. To the northwest, a white gate connects with the Culling Pens.

#### 54. Troll Cavern

>>Broken and gnawed bones are strewn across the turf in this forested cavern. Against the eastern ledge is a black gate. On the wall southwest of the gate is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** Three **trolls** live in this area, two males that fight constantly and one immense, dominant female that lazes near the black gate. They wait to be fed or given prisoners to play with, which allows the characters a few moments to decide on a course of action. If the party lingers, it's likely to dawn on the trolls that the characters are fair game.

***Glyph Key.*** The female troll has a glyph key attuned to this zone, with which she and her allies can pursue fleeing characters.

***White Gate.*** A white gate is situated in the opening in the wall that leads to the Forest of Weakness.

#### 55. Pool of Consumption

>>A pool in this cavern glows with pale gray light.
>>

The pool's necromancy magic grants undead creatures that drink from it the benefits of finishing a short rest. An undead creature can drink from the pool safely only once per tenday. The second time the creature drinks in a tenday, its hit point maximum is halved for one tenday (*remove curse* negates this effect). The third time the creature drinks in a tenday, it suffers the effects of a *harm* spell (save DC 15).

It isn't safe for a non-undead creature to drink from the pool. If the creature does, it gains no benefits and takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage.

#### 56. Behir Lair

>>The trees in this forested cavern are scorched and gouged. The turf is burned and overturned, revealing the stone floor in places.
>>

A **behir** spends its days sleeping and eating in this chamber. The creature is asleep or otherwise preoccupied when the characters come here. It doesn't attack unless provoked.

***White Gate.*** A white gate is located in the passage to the north that connects with the Iron Golem Foundries.

### Forest of Weakness
Powerful transmutation magic suffuses the trees in this zone. When an intruder ends its turn in an area of trees, the creature must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

#### 57. Leucrotta Lair

>>This area resembles a tranquil meadow dotted with a few trees.
>>

***Tracks.*** The ground seems to be covered with the tracks of large deer or elk, but a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Nature) check reveals that these tracks are those of leucrottas.

***Creatures.*** Four **leucrottas** lurk here among the trees. They make noises that sound like the calls of pained humans, which their handlers normally ignore. The creatures gleefully attack anyone they succeed in tricking.

***White Gates.*** A white gate sits in the opening to the north that leads to the Forest of Death. Another gate lies to the south, giving access to the Forest of Recovery.

#### 58. Pool of Renewal

>>A pool in this cavern glows with pale yellow light. Northeast of the pool, the turf gives way to a stone floor with a black gate set into it. East of the gate is a contact stone.
>>

***Pool.*** The pool's magic grants creatures that drink from it the benefits of a *greater restoration* or a *lesser restoration* spell (creature's choice). A creature can drink from the pool safely only once per tenday. The second time the creature drinks in a tenday, its hit point maximum is halved for one tenday (*remove curse* negates this effect). The third time the creature drinks in a tenday, it suffers the effects of a *harm* spell (save DC 15).

#### 59. Choker Grotto

>>This big side chamber has a few small copses of trees and a few piles of bones.
>>

***Bones.*** The gnawed bones of six humans are here. Each has crushed neck vertebrae, which someone can discern with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

***Creatures.*** Six **chokers** live here, two lurking in each of the two treed areas near the pool and two on the walls near the pool. They wait and watch, attacking when the characters move within reach, which their handlers rarely do. The chokers in the trees try to pull victims into the treed areas.

#### 60. Owlbear Grove

>>The trees grow closer together in this cavern, giving it the look of a silent forest. A monstrous owlbear crouches low at a pool of still water, its razor-sharp beak and bright eyes on display as its gaze tracks you.
>>

Two adult **owlbears** and three **reduced-threat owlbear** young (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) lurk among the trees here. They wait long enough to see if food is being handed out, and they attack if none seems forthcoming. The young are hidden, and they join the fight from the flanks after their parents attack.

***White Gate.*** The passage that leads east has a white gate that connects with the Prison of Filth.

## Ooze Grottos
The Red Wizards use the magic of this sector to breed and control oozes.

Locations in the Ooze Grottos are identified on map 5.8.

![[014-dit08.png|right|300]]

***Ooze Prod.*** An *ooze prod* is a quarterstaff that deals 1d4 force damage instead of the normal damage of that weapon. The prod suffers no damage from contact with oozes. In addition, an ooze hit by a prod has its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed during that time. If an *ooze prod* is used as a weapon, it breaks the first time a natural 1 is rolled on an attack roll with it.

***Interactions.*** Most living Thayans assigned to this sector hate being here. Thayans who surrender here hate the sector so much that they are more inclined to give truthful information about it.

**Sentient Oozes**. One of the many experiments in the Doomvault is an effort to infuse oozes with intelligence. The Red Wizards have met with some success, though the process requires the sacrifice of many subjects. The sentient oozes that result from this process are the same as normal versions of such monsters, except that they have Intelligence 5, can understand basic communication in Common, and are no longer immune to being charmed.

### Augmentation Chambers
The magic of these chambers allows Thayans to bestow glimmers of intelligence into living oozes, making them obedient and more capable combatants.

#### 61. Bone Room

>>Cracked and decaying bones are piled throughout this chamber. In the northwest corner is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** Three **sentient ochre jellies** and a **wight** guard this area. The wight confronts anyone who enters but stands down if the characters look like Thayans and give a credible reason for being here. Otherwise, the creatures attack.

***Bone Piles.*** Here lie fragments of bone left from bodies destroyed in attempts to infuse oozes with humanoid intelligence. The piles are 3 feet high. It costs 15 feet of movement to move 5 feet across a pile. A creature that enters or starts its turn in a pile takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

***White Gate.*** A white gate stands at the junction in the corridor to the northeast, leading to the Spawn Pools and to the Blood Pools.

#### 62. Ooze Temple

>>This chamber has stone benches, columns, and a raised altar, all suggesting it might have once been a temple or forum. Skeletons are arrayed across the benches.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **deathlock wights** with buckets and stone boots move among dozens of skeletons. They pour steaming ooze over the bones. Two **sentient ochre jellies** and two **sentient gray oozes** are pooled near the benches.

***Spilled Ooze.*** The spilled ooze essence makes the area around the benches difficult terrain. Any creature that ends its turn in the area of the spilled ooze takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. The wights aren't affected, thanks to their boots.

***Raised Altar.*** This raised altar is 10 feet above the floor. It has sides of smooth stone.

***White Gate.*** The corridor to the east contains a white gate that leads to the Spawning Pools.

#### 63. Spawn Vats
The sound of flowing and bubbling liquid is audible from the northern hallway leading to this chamber.

>>This enormous chamber of gray stone is filled with square vats made of the same material. At the center of the chamber, a great fountain spews black liquid that lands in a wide stone pool. Trenches cut into the floor run from the fountain bowl to the vats. The eastern wall of the chamber is partly covered by a long black curtain.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **deathlock wights** and four **skeletons** move among the vats, using *ooze prods* to poke the mixtures. They challenge any intruders. If the undead become distracted, oozes might attack (see "Vat System" below).

Sarkalla, a Red Wizard **transmuter**, is working behind the black curtain, but she peeks out in response to the wights' challenge. She whispers to order the lead wight to attack. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices Sarkalla while she does so.

Quite mad, Sarkalla cares only for her experiments and her "precious children"—the oozes that she is working to imbue with intelligence in order to create "the perfect assassins." If she and her wights have the upper hand in combat, or if all the wights are destroyed, she calls for a break in hostilities. She proudly talks of the sentient oozes that will wreak havoc for Thay. She promises the characters positions as assistants and bodyguards to the **Ooze Master** (see *area 65*). If the characters accept, they are allowed to leave and go to *area 64*. Sarkalla otherwise attacks again and fights until killed.

***Vat System.*** A 10-foot-high, circular magic fountain forms the center of a vat system. Around it are 3-foot-high square vats. Trenches, each 2 feet wide and 1 foot deep, connect the fountain to the vats. The whole system contains necrotic essence that prepares oozes for binding to undead.

A creature that enters the necrotic essence for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed until the start of its next turn.

Six of the eight square vats each contain one ooze, all of them reduced-threat versions of the creatures (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above). Two vats hold black puddings (marked B on the map), one has a gray ooze (G), and three contain ochre jellies (O). Usually, wights use *ooze prods* to keep the oozes in the vats. If the wights are engaged in combat, roll a d6 at the end of every round. If the indicated ooze is still in a vat, it escapes and tries to attack the nearest creatures.

| d6 | Ooze |
|:---:|---|
| 1–2 | **Black pudding** |
| 3 | **Gray ooze** |
| 4–6 | **Ochre jelly** |

***Black Curtain.*** Beyond a heavy black curtain, Sarkalla has her quarters, which contain a bed, a table strewn with writing implements and books, and shelves piled with bound volumes and scrolls.

***Contact Stone.*** A circle of glowing glyphs above Sarkalla's southern table is a contact stone.

***Treasure.*** Sarkalla's table and shelves contain two pieces of lore, four *spell scrolls* (two each of *dispel magic* and *greater restoration*), a *potion of greater healing*, a *potion of heroism*, and six valuable tomes on underground exploration and natural history (worth 120 gp each).

***Glyph Key.*** Sarkalla has a glyph key attuned to this zone, the Immortal Caverns, the Spawning Pools, and the Temples of Nature (in the Temples of Extraction sector).

***White Gate.*** The passage to the south has a white gate that connects with the Immortal Caverns.

### Immortal Caverns
Horrifying by-products of the Red Wizards' dark ooze experiments are found here.

#### 64. White Maw
This area is unlit.

>>The cavern walls here are dry white stone, as is the clean floor. Toward the center, a massive, cracked black pillar rises to the dark ceiling.
>>

***Creature.*** The cavern is occupied by **White Maw**, a gray ooze so enormous that it covers the entire floor and much of the walls. Unlike the other sentient oozes, this one is quite intelligent (Intelligence 12) and has the ability to communicate telepathically to creatures within 50 feet of it.

As soon as the last character enters, solid white "stone" closes over each exit as **White Maw** seals the characters within itself. The ooze is insane and displays multiple personalities of the creatures that were sacrificed to imbue it with sentience. Although it might communicate briefly with the characters, eventually madness takes hold and it attacks, slamming the characters with pseudopods that manifest from the floor or walls. The characters attack it by targeting the floor or walls of the cavern.

When **White Maw** drops to 0 hit points, cracks shoot through the smooth white stone, which collapses to white dust, exposing the exits and dropping the characters 1 foot to the actual floor of dark stone.

***Black Pillar.*** The black pillar is infused with psionic energy. Any creature that touches it for the first time on a turn takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage and is knocked prone.

***White Gates.*** The opening to the north contains a white gate that connects with the Augmentation Chambers. To the northeast is another white gate that leads to the Spawning Pools.

#### 65. Red Master

>>An enormous pillar of thick red liquid stretches from floor to ceiling in this cavern. Embedded within the pillar is a whispering, crimson-robed humanoid form.
>>
>>To the northeast is a black gate. East of the gate is a contact stone.
>>

***Creature.*** A Red Wizard known only as the **Ooze Master** has melded with the pillar of red ooze. He uses his powers to make sure the red pillar consumes those who come here.

The Ooze Master is the result of a failed experiment to blend a Red Wizard with ooze. When the characters arrive, the Ooze Master assumes they are **Thayan apprentices** come to join him "in immortality." He greets them and honors their "great sacrifice." The Ooze Master knows if **White Maw** has been killed (though not who did it), and vows to use the characters' power, once it is consumed, to seek out and punish those responsible. He also speaks of "the great transformation," when all Red Wizards will be joined with oozes.

***Red Pillar.*** The red pillar flows like viscous fluid. When a creature moves within 10 feet of the pillar, the creature feels its body soften. Whenever a creature starts its turn within 10 feet of the pillar, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) acid damage. A creature that drops to 0 hit points due to this effect dies and collapses into a puddle of gooey red liquid. The fluid then flows into the pillar.

***Dungeon State.*** The **Ooze Master** is a sort of lich. If destroyed, he remains in the red pillar but doesn't regain consciousness. His unconscious form whispers as if dreaming. The Ooze Master dies only if the Phylactery Vault is disabled at the end of the adventure.

***White Gate.*** In the passage to the southeast is a white gate that leads to the Forest of Illusion.

#### 66. Black Elder

>>In the brilliant light shed by the white pillar at the center of this cavern, a pool of mottled black liquid gleams.
>>

***Light.*** The white pillar fills this area with bright light.

***Pool.*** Silvery calm water forms this highly reflective, 1-foot-deep pool. Until a character looks into the pool and notices its mirrorlike nature, it takes a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice that quality.

***Creature.*** An **elder black pudding** (Huge size; 130 hit points) lurks on the ceiling here, reflected in the pool. Unless a character looks up and sees the ooze, it quickly slides down the pillar and attacks with surprise.

***White Pillar.*** A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the pillar regains 1d6 hit points. If this effect restores a wounded creature to its hit point maximum, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until it finishes a short rest.

### Spawning Pools
In these connected chambers, Red Wizards breed oozes for their experiments.

***Noise.*** Anyone near *area 68* can hear the loud sound of steel grinding flesh and bone, rising and falling at intervals. The noise means that Thayans here fail to perceive sounds of combat from nearby areas.

***Glyph Keys.*** Every one of the Red Wizards in this zone has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

#### 67. Laboratory Barracks

>>Dozens of fine gilt mirrors stand between silk hangings along the walls of this once-splendid salon. A dozen rough cots are spread across the center of the room. Shrouded magic lights are set into floor stands between them, dimly lighting the area.
>>
>>Near a niche along the eastern wall is a black gate.
>>

***Advance Notice.*** Any character who studies the room for a moment and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that all the cots and lights are 10 feet or more away from the walls.

***Creatures.*** One Red Wizard **transmuter** and three **Thayan apprentices** sleep here. When roused, they tip the cots over and cast their spells from behind cover. They try to force or draw the characters close to the walls and the magic mirrors, hoping to summon the deadly defenders of this area.

***Cursed Mirrors.*** Cursed mirrors are on all the walls except those within 5 feet of the exit points, including the black gate and the secret door. Conjuration magic in the mirrors works such that any living humanoid that moves within 5 feet of one must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, or a howling **specter** emerges from the mirror to attack. Once they have collectively called forth five undead, the mirrors all become dormant for 1 hour.

***White Gates.*** The corridor leading west has a white gate that connects with the Augmentation Chambers. Beyond the secret door to the east is a gate that offers access to the Blood Pools.

#### 68. Arch of Blades

>>A large archway of worked stone stands at the center of this curving cavern. A stack of pig carcasses is piled haphazardly along the eastern wall. Buckets are arrayed on the northern side of the arch, as well as along the southern wall.
>>
>>On the wall to the west of the arch is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** One Red Wizard **transmuter** oversees two **Thayan apprentices** and six **skeletons** here. Four skeletons drag pig carcasses toward the arch and heave them through, while blades scythe across the opening and reduce each body to a heap of blood, flesh, and bone that collects on the far side. Two skeletons then pick up shovels and collect the gore in buckets, making the flesh easier to transport.

If the characters watch long enough, the apprentices eventually carry full buckets toward the southern entrance and retrieve empty buckets stacked there.

***Arch of Blades.*** The 3-foot-thick, 15-foot-diameter arch is a former trap imbued with enchantment magic. The Red Wizards suppressed the magic, but they couldn't do away with it completely. Any non-undead creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the arch must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to run through the opening (a creature ignores this effect if immune to being charmed).

The magic blades in the arch come to life when any creature comes within 5 feet of the opening. A creature that moves through the arch must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature compelled to run through the arch must make another DC 15 Wisdom saving throw after doing so. On a failed save, the creature stops moving while still within 5 feet of the arch. The creature can willingly move farther away only after the start of its next turn.

A creature that succeeds on two Wisdom saving throws against the arch's effect becomes immune to the effect for 24 hours.

***White Gate.*** The passage to the northeast contains a white gate, which connects with the Culling Pens.

#### 69. Spawn Cavern

>>Broad, circular pools are spread across this cavern, each filled with dark goo. The area smells of blood.
>>

***Creatures.*** One Red Wizard **transmuter** oversees two **Thayan apprentices** in this cavern. They walk a circuit around the pools, carefully jabbing down into them with the *ooze prods* they carry.

***Spawn Pools.*** These 5-foot-deep pools are filled with ravenous ooze spawn that are nourished into full-grown oozes by feeding them pig meat. Each pool contains gray oozes, ochre jellies, or black puddings. The pools are magically warded to keep the spawn from climbing up the interior walls, but that doesn't keep them from striking out at nearby creatures with their pseudopods. Any creature that starts its turn adjacent to a spawn pool must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) acid damage. If a creature strikes a pool with an *ooze prod*, the pool's pseudopod attacks are suppressed until the end of that creature's next turn.

A creature that enters a pool for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn in one, takes 9 (2d8) acid damage.

***White Gate.*** The route to the southwest contains a white gate that connects with the Immortal Caverns.

### Culling Pens
Young oozes feed on each other in the great pools that fill these caverns.

#### 70. Battle Pool
If creatures occupy this area, those that approach it can hear the sounds of thrashing in liquid.

>>A jet-black pool that roils like a storm-tossed sea takes up half this cavern.
>>

***Creatures.*** One Red Wizard **transmuter** and two **Thayan apprentices** are focused on the black pool with their *ooze prods*. When the Thayans turn away to deal with the characters, a Medium **reduced-threat black pudding** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) emerges from the ooze pool at the start of the second round. Another such pudding emerges at the start of the fourth round, and another at the start of the sixth round. The Thayans try to keep the characters between themselves and the pool, since the oozes see all other creatures as prey.

***Ooze Pool.*** Filled with **reduced-threat black puddings**, the pool is 2 feet deep and difficult terrain. Transmutation magic on the pool keeps most of the puddings in a torpid state so that they react only to stimulation from a nearby source. A creature that enters the pool for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 13 (3d8) acid damage. In addition, every time a creature moves 5 feet in the pool, the creature is subject to an opportunity attack from a black pudding.

***Black Gate.*** A black gate is set into the western alcove, not immediately visible from the entrance.

***White Gate.*** To the southwest, a white gate separates this area from the Spawning Pools.

#### 71. Dead Pool

>>A reeking, acrid pool of slime and sludge fills most of this cavern, leaving only a rocky ledge to both sides.
>>
>>East of the pool is a contact stone.
>>

***Noise.*** Unless areas 72 and 73 have been cleared, combat noise in those areas can be heard here.

***Acidic Vapor.*** The air contains acidic vapors. A creature that starts its turn here must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (1d4) acid damage. A creature that holds its breath or doesn't need to breathe has advantage on the saving throw.

***Ooze Pool.*** Filled with the remains of dead oozes, the pool is 2 feet deep and difficult terrain. A creature that enters the pool for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 9 (2d8) acid damage and 9 (2d8) poison damage.

***Development.*** Any noise in this area alerts creatures in areas 72 and 73.

***White Gate.*** The exit to the south has a white gate that connects with the Forest of Recovery.

#### 72. Ooze Duel

>>This cavern bears minor signs of multiple combats.
>>

***Creatures.*** One Red Wizard **transmuter** and two **dread warriors** watch from near the eastern wall as four **Thayan warriors** battle a **gelatinous cube**. Two of the four warriors have been engulfed, and all are at half hit points (as is the ooze). If the wizard notices the characters aren't Thayan, he orders the others to attack them instead. The cube views everyone in the area as a foe.

#### 73. Jelly Pit

>>A rough pit takes up half of this cavern.
>>

***Creatures.*** One Red Wizard **transmuter** and two **Thayan apprentices** use *ooze prods* to keep three Medium **ochre jellies** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) in the pit and fighting. When the Thayans start combat with the characters, each of the three oozes emerges from the pit 1d4 rounds later (roll for each). The oozes see all other creatures as prey.

***Jelly Pit.*** Filled with young, **reduced-threat ochre jellies**, living and dead, the pit is 3 feet deep and difficult terrain. Transmutation magic on the pit keeps most of the jellies in a torpid state so they react only to stimulation from a nearby source. A creature that enters the pool for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 9 (2d8) acid damage. In addition, every time a creature moves 5 feet in the pit, the creature is subject to an opportunity attack from an ochre jelly.

***White Gate.*** The corridor that leads southeast holds a white gate that provides access to the Forest of Death.

## Predator Pools
The Red Wizards' plans involve the disruption and control of the Sword Coast's trade. To that end, the Thayans are spawning an aquatic army.

Locations in the Predator Pools are identified on map 5.9.

![[015-dit09.png|right|300]]

***Pools.*** The saltwater pools in this sector are 50 feet deep, and the surface of each pool is 1 foot below the surrounding floor. It takes 5 extra feet of movement to move from a pool onto the floor. Unless otherwise noted, transmutation magic in each pool keeps the water clean.

The pools also exude enchantment magic. Living in the water causes hypnotic dreams that, after weeks or months of exposure, improve combat skill and imbue most creatures with strong devotion to the Red Wizards.

***Reactions.*** Creatures in this sector usually hesitate to attack those who seem to be Thayan but quickly overcome this reticence if the characters linger and fail to act according to type. Most aquatic monsters prefer to drag foes into the water.

***Water Globes.*** Floating 5 feet above the floor, these magic water globes are 15 feet in diameter. Red Wizards use them to hold aquatic creatures for transport through the black gates.

As an action, a creature that is within 5 feet of a globe and has an Intelligence score of 10 or higher can take control of the globe by succeeding on a DC 10 Intelligence check. As part of its movement and with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check, the controller can direct the globe to move with it, remaining within 5 feet of the controller. A globe's controller can enter and leave the globe at will. The controller can maintain control of the globe while within 100 feet of it. Another creature that qualifies as a controller can gain control of a globe by winning a contest of Intelligence checks against the current controller.

A creature that touches a globe but isn't its controller must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be drawn into the globe and unable to pass back through its boundary. As an action, a trapped creature can free itself with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. Also as an action, a globe's controller can release a trapped creature with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. A creature inside a globe has half cover against effects that originate outside the globe. While inside a globe, a trapped creature can't contest for control of the globe.

### Pools of Devotion
A spirit naga oversees this zone and its creatures.

#### 74. Kraken Pool

>>Beyond a broad round pool in the center of this circular chamber is a black gate.
>>

A **malformed kraken** is held in this saltwater pool. Although it responds to specific orders from Red Wizards, it attacks anyone in the room who looks over the edge of the pool.

***White Gates.*** The corridor that connects this area with the Fiendish Arena has a white gate. Another one is to the east, behind a set of doors and a secret door, in the passage that leads to the Halls of Conditioning.

#### 75. Dragon Turtle Prison
If the dragon turtle occupies this area, characters approaching can hear the rattle and clank of immense chains.

>>Gigantic steel bolts have been driven into the stone floor of this immense area, attached to heavy chains. These trail down into the water of a vast pool situated between curving northern and southern staircases that lead up to double doors. Two enormous globes of blue liquid are suspended in the air to the east.
>>

***Creatures.*** One **reduced-threat dragon turtle** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above)—it has no tail attack—recently taken from Lake Thaylambar, has been chained here while the insidious mind control magic of the pools takes effect. Not yet under the sway of Thay, it grows agitated when any creature enters this chamber, and it's likely to attack.

The dragon turtle wants freedom, and it is small enough to use a black gate. Any offer of freedom, including the use of a glyph key, causes a break in hostilities while the creature listens. If it is freed, unless the characters know of the circle in *area 82*, the dragon turtle goes to *area 76* and escapes through the gatehouse.

The turtle knows that Ihanvas, the naga overseer of this zone, dwells in *area 76*. It can be persuaded with a successful DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check to fight the naga if it is lured into this chamber.

***Chains.*** Magic infuses the chains, which are long enough to allow the dragon turtle free run of the chamber. When the dragon turtle moves, any creature within 10 feet of its path must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

The dragon turtle can't harm or break the binding chains. The characters can open each of the two pin locks with a separate successful DC 20 Dexterity check.

***White Gate.*** Behind the doors to the south is a white gate that connects with the Warrior Pools.

#### 76. Naga's Den
If the spirit naga occupies this area, anyone who listens at the entry doors hears a scream of pain.

>>The magical light shimmers off two circular pools in this chamber. A glowing glyph covers a broad area of the floor in the south. On the eastern wall is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** Ihanvas, the **spirit naga** overseer of this zone, is eating a prisoner. The naga attacks any intruders. Ten **commoners** also linger in the pools here. Ihanvas's Charisma, combined with the magic water, has turned them into the naga's willing devotees. They defend their master in any battle.

***Southern Interior Door.*** The southern door to *area 77* is locked.

***Curse Glyph.*** Ihanvas wants to block direct access to her lair from *area 77*, so a magic glyph has been placed in the area marked on the map. Any creature that enters the marked area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls against the naga, while the naga has advantage on saving throws against the creature's capabilities. The effect is a curse that lasts until Ihanvas dies.

***Pools.*** A lip around the interior edge of each pool forms a 5-foot shelf where the water is only 3 feet deep. Further, a tunnel connects each pool to the other at the bottom, so the two pools are really one U-shaped structure, which Ihanvas can use to move through the room.

***Treasure.*** The naga wears a platinum circlet set with sapphires (worth 1,000 gp) and matching earrings (500 gp for the pair).

Hidden at the bottom of the pools' connecting tunnel, Ihanvas's treasure includes 200 pp, five tourmaline jewels (100 gp each), *+1 plate* and a sealed ivory case that holds seven *spell scrolls* (two each of *detect magic*, *identify*, and *lesser restoration*, and one of *remove curse*).

***Glyph Key.*** Ihanvas carries a glyph key attuned to this zone, the Warrior Pools, the Spawn Pools, and the Blood Pools.

***White Gate.*** Behind the doors to the south is a white gate that connects with the Warrior Pools.

### Warrior Pools
This gruesome zone is packed with the foulest of the aquatic soldiers.

***Light.*** Unless otherwise noted, this zone has no light sources.

#### 77. Scrag Pool

>>A circular pool in this chamber has foul slime filled with bits of bone along its edge. To the west is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **trolls**, a male and a larger female, lurk in the pool. These trolls are of an aquatic variety known as **scrags**. In addition to the statistics of a normal troll, each has a swim speed of 30 feet and can breathe underwater.

***Pool.*** The floor within 5 feet of the pool is crusted with the remains of the scrags' meals. If a creature makes a Dexterity saving throw while on the floor in this area and the saving throw fails, the creature falls prone. If the save fails by 5 or more, the creature then slides into the pool.

***White Gate.*** The corridor leading north has a white gate that separates this area from the Pools of Devotion.

#### 78. Undead Pool

>>The stench of death is overwhelming here. The pool at the center of this chamber is a blackened sea of floating corpses. Three enormous globes of blue liquid are suspended in the air to the east.
>>
>>West of the pool, just south of a set of double doors, is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** Eight **ghouls** here float like corpses in the water until they catch the scent of non-undead creatures. These ghouls are of an aquatic variety known as **lacedons**. In addition to the statistics of a normal ghoul, each has a swim speed of 30 feet.

***Pool.*** The necromancy magic in this pool is intended not to keep it clean but to kill intruders. Any creature that makes an attack dealing radiant damage in this area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or move to the pool and jump in as soon as it can. A creature that enters the pool for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.

***Development.*** Any combat that lasts more than 3 rounds attracts the scrags in *area 77*. They enter the fray here at the start of the fifth round.

***White Gates.*** The corridor leading north has a white gate that separates this area from the Pools of Devotion. To the south, a white gate stands in the corridor that leads to the Flesh Golem Mortuaries.

#### 79. Bone Pool

>>The floor of this sweltering chamber and its pool are spread with a fine layer of shattered bone. The faint illumination from a pair of low-burning braziers reveals piles of animal skulls set around the edge of the water.
>>

***Creatures.*** Four **merrow** entertain themselves by decorating their lair and chewing bones.

***Pool.*** The magic of the pool has failed, and the water is filthy. Any non-undead creature that starts its turn in the pool must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.

***Bones.*** Pig bones and humanoid bones are scattered across the floor, but a few 1-foot-high piles are difficult terrain.

***Braziers.*** The magic stone braziers are built into the room and can't be moved. A creature that touches a brazier takes 3 (1d6) fire damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

***White Gate.*** A white gate stands in the corridor that leads south to the Spawn Pools.

### Spawn Pools
The Red Wizards refocused the magic of these once-deadly pools to spawn aquatic creatures under the supervision of a sea hag.

***Spawning Essence.*** Blue glowing water in this zone is spawning essence, the transmutation magic of which causes spawn to grow quickly and strengthens their predatory nature. A creature that drinks spawning essence gains the benefit of finishing a short rest. A humanoid can safely gain this benefit only once per tenday. If a creature drinks again within that time, it gains no benefit and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of a *confusion* spell for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

***Spawn Pools.*** The round pools in this zone are cut 10 feet deep into the surrounding stone floor. Spawn pools are filled with spawning essence.

***Spawn Pits.*** Rectangular 5-foot-deep spawn pits are filled with spawning essence. Each pit holds juvenile predatory fish. A creature that enters a pit for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage from the attacks of these fish.

#### 80. Black Gate Pool

>>Beneath walls set with relief carvings of humanoid couples romantically entwined, the bottom of a slimy, dimly luminous pool is shrouded in shadow. Trenches from the pool flow into one-foot-diameter tubes in the wall. An enormous globe of blue liquid is suspended in the air to the west.
>>

***Creatures.*** Five **kuo-toa** are on guard. Another four are sleeping on the bottom of the pool. All of them are loyal to Thay and expect to be asked to escort those who pass through this area. They attack anyone who makes no such request.

***Black Gate.*** This zone's black gate is underwater at the bottom of the pool.

***Development.*** If combat lasts longer than 3 rounds, the activity draws the attention of the creatures in *area 81*. They open the southern doors during the fourth round of combat and retreat to draw characters into the spawn pits in *area 81*.

***White Gate.*** A white gate stands in the corridor that leads north to the Warrior Pools.

#### 81. Spawn Hall

>>Relief carvings along this arch-roofed hall show scenes of demons and humanoids engaged in debauchery. Five pits cut into the floor are filled with glowing water. South of these pools on a rough wall is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** A **dread warrior**, two **wights**, and four **zombies** guard this area. They attack anyone who isn't escorted by kuo-toa or the sea hag, pursuing such interlopers to any area of the zone.

***Glyph Key.*** The dread warrior has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

#### 82. Sea Hag Lair

>>Two large pools fill a chamber whose walls are carved with reliefs of humanoids frolicking with cherubic angels. Water from the pools flows into pits that spread along the walls from one corner. A foul pile of debris and bones stands in the opposite corner of the chamber.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two male **merrow** dwell in the south pool. A **sea hag** named Tanjus luxuriates under the surface of the north pool with her pets, six **giant crabs**. She oversees the spawning pools in this zone and yearns to overthrow Ihanvas (*area 76*) for control of the Predator Pools and theirmonsters.

During combat, Tanjus offers the characters a temporary truce. She asks them to find and kill Ihanvas, because Tanjus wants to be the dominant force in this portion of the dungeon. The hag offers two pieces of lore and promises that none of her creatures will leave this sector. She also says that the characters can move freely through this zone once the naga is disposed of.

***Development.*** If combat lasts longer than 3 rounds, the activity draws the attention of the creatures in *area 81*. They open the southern doors during the fourth round of combat and attack unless Tanjus orders them not to.

***North Pool.*** A magic circle is scribed on the bottom of the north pool. It's a combination summoning circle and teleportation circle, but it's currently dormant. A spellcaster who succeeds on three DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) checks can reactivate the circle's conjuration magic. The character then becomes aware that the circle allows teleportation to the sea floor off Bezantur, deep down in the Sea of Fallen Stars.

***Debris Pile.*** Any creature that starts its turn in this disgusting pile, which is difficult terrain, must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. Creatures that live in this zone are immune to this effect.

***Secret Door.*** The secret door in the north wall is built just above the surface of the contents of the spawn pit.

***Treasure.*** Tanjus has a black pearl (500 gp), a golden gorget set with aquamarines (1,000 gp), and a *staff of charming*.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check while searching the debris discovers five *potions of water breathing* and two *spell scrolls* of *water walk*.

***Glyph Key.*** Tanjus has a glyph key attuned to this zone and the Pools of Devotion.

***Dungeon State.*** If the characters leave Tanjus alive and Ihanvas is killed, the hag and her merrow allies relocate to *area 76*. No matter what else happens, Tanjus and her monsters attack any characters who return to this zone.

***White Gates.*** A white gate stands at the junction in the corridor to the south, which leads to the Augmentation Chambers and to the Blood Pools. Another white gate is located in the corridor to the north behind the secret door that leads toward the Blood Pools.

### Blood Pools
The Red Wizards have the allegiance of sahuagin that are exiled from Aleaxtis in the Sea of Fallen Stars.

***Light.*** Unless otherwise notes, this zone has no light sources.

#### 83. Baron's Court

>>The pool that takes up most of this circular chamber is filled with clear water. Stone pillars rise from the bottom to break the surface. Sets of double doors are spaced evenly around the room's perimeter.
>>

***Creatures.*** Six **sahuagin** swim along the surface around the edge of the pool, while a **sahuagin baron** and two **hunter sharks** swim deeper down.

Enmity between the baron and the priestess (*area 84*) means that these sahuagin make no attempt to call for aid.

The sahuagin know the hazards of the pillars. They aren't aware of the secret door.

***Paralysis Pillars.*** The tops of the pillars are even with the floor around the edge of the pool, so they protrude 1 foot above the surface of the water. The remnants of an old magical trap exist in the three pillars marked with an X on the map. A creature that ends its turn touching the top of one of those pillars must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature slips into the water and sinks to the bottom of the pool. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

***Treasure.*** The baron wears *+1 leather armor* (shark skin and chitin) and a crown-like helm of ivory, coral, leather, and gold (worth 500 gp).

At the bottom of the pool is a stone coffer that contains a stash of 100 pp and eight large pearls (100 gp). It also has a crystal phial that contains a *potion of diminution*.

***Glyph Key.*** The sahuagin baron has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gates.*** In the corridor behind the secret door is a white gate that connects with the Spawn Pools. In the passage that leads east, a white gate stands between this area and the Stone Golem Quarries.

#### 84. Altar Pool
If the sahuagin occupy this area, those approaching can hear chanting.

>>An octagonal pool fills this chamber. A slick of blood darkens the water around a stepped stone altar that sits on a broad pillar rising from the pool. Smaller pillars are spread around the central one. An enormous globe of blue liquid is suspended in the air to the north.
>>

***Creatures.*** Four **sahuagin** stand and chant along with a **sahuagin priestess** on the altar pillar. Another five sahuagin and two **hunter sharks** dwell in the pool. A **commoner** is bound on the altar.

The chanting that precedes the sacrifice takes 3 rounds to complete. If the characters deal at least 20 damage to the priestess in that time, she breaks off the ritual to lead a counterattack. Otherwise, the prisoner is slain and thrown to the sharks. Any sahuagin on the altar then gains the effects of the *aid* and *bless* spells.

Enmity between the priestess and the baron (*area 83*) means that these sahuagin make no attempt to call for aid.

***Altar Pillar.*** The outside area of the pillar is 1 foot above the surface of the water. The central altar rises 3 feet above the outside pillar. It takes 5 extra feet of movement to move from the outside pillar to the top of the altar.

***Paralysis Pillars.*** See *area 83*.

***Prisoner.*** If the prisoner is saved, he is in the same mental state as the prisoners in *area 85*. He can't aid the characters or answer questions.

***Ledge.*** A 10-foot-high rough ledge separates this area from *area 85*.

***Treasure.*** The priestess carries a *dagger of venom* and wears a headdress of ivory, coral, leather, and gold (worth 500 gp).

***Glyph Key.*** The sahuagin priestess has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gates.*** The narrow exit to the south opens onto a white gate that offers access to the Spawning Pools. The northeast corridor contains a white gate that connects with the Stone Golem Quarries.

#### 85. Prisoner Cavern

>>On the north wall of this cavern is a black stone shrine set with relief carvings of roses. On the wall about a foot above the arcane shrine is a contact stone. To the south is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** A **dread warrior** keeps watch with seven **skeletons**. They do little but confront creatures moving toward or appearing from either magic gate. The characters can enter and leave this area from the east without fighting, even with the prisoners in tow.

Part of the deal the Red Wizards struck with the sahuagin involves providing prisoners for dark rites and horrid meals. The magic of the black shrine keeps ten **commoners** standing around it in a catatonic state.

***Black Shrine.*** Any non-undead creature that moves to within 20 feet of the black shrine or ends its turn in such a location must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the necromancy magic of the shrine lowers the creature's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores by 1d6 each (roll once for all three). A creature can be affected only once per round. If any affected score is reduced to 2 or lower, the character becomes paralyzed. A character who leaves the area recovers in 1 minute.

***Ledge.*** A 10-foot-high rough ledge separates this area from *area 84*.

***Glyph Key.*** The dread warrior has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

## Golem Laboratories
In these formerly cursed temples and workshops, the Red Wizards create golems.

Locations in the Golem Laboratories are identified on map 5.10.

![[016-dit10.png|right|300]]

***Golems.*** If a golem is inactive, it is unconscious. If a golem is listed as being a reduced-threat monster, it is because the construct is incomplete.

***Dungeon State.*** When these areas are cleared, any golems that remained inactive become inert and can't be activated thereafter.

***Treasure.*** The treasure in this sector consists of materials and tools used in the creation of the golems. As such, the value of the treasure is less than what might be expected.

***White Gate.*** A white gate stands at the junction in the corridor to the west, leading to the Augmentation Chambers and to the Spawn Pools.

### Flesh Golem Mortuaries
Red Wizards bind and reanimate dead flesh and bone in these halls.

#### 86. Hall of Teleportation

>>The walls of this massive hall are carved with reliefs of humanoid monarchs adorned with jeweled crowns and other finery, while servants bow at their feet. Huge white pillars rise to the ceiling.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **reduced-threat helmed horrors** and a **reduced-threat flesh golem** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above) stand inactive here in front of pillars. The golem hopes to draw on the pillars' lightning effect to become fully empowered. They come to life if attacked or when the teleportation magic of the pillars is triggered.

***Teleporting Pillars.*** The first time a creature moves within 5 feet of a pillar on its turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to a random space next to another pillar (roll a d20). The creature also takes 5 (2d4) lightning damage. If the destination pillar is the same as the origin pillar, the creature takes double damage.

***White Gate.*** The corridor that leads east has a white gate that connects with the Clay Golem Kilns.

#### 87. Golem Vault

>>Relief-carved walls showing nobles at a great feast make a stark counterpoint to the stench of preservatives with a hint of rot. Flesh golems in their first gruesome stages of assembly are on a few of the tables. Other tables contain only prepared body parts and bones.
>>
>>A contact stone is set in the midpoint of the southern wall.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **necromancer** and two **Thayan apprentices** are in this area, moving among the tables working or selecting parts. Four **skeletons** keep watch from the corners, while a **ghoul** mops gore from the floors. Golems in this area can't be activated and are no threat.

***Treasure.*** One table contains special unguents and bindings used in the creation of the golems. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that these materials, which weigh 10 pounds, are worth 1,500 gp.

***Glyph Key.*** The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gate.*** The eastern corridor holds a white gate that leads to the Clay Golem Kilns.

#### 88. Black Prison

>>A large stone block on the floor between the room's double doors prevents them from fully closing. Within, rusted black iron cages hang by heavy chains from the ceiling of this dark-walled chamber. In the northeast corner is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** A **wight** commands eight **zombies** who guard this chamber while some members of their squad recover in the cages. One **deathlock wight** and two wights rest in the cages.

***Cages.*** The bottoms of these unlocked cages hang 3 feet above the floor. Necromancy magic on the cages restores 20 hit points per hour to an undead creature in a cage. A non-undead creature in a cage takes the same amount of necrotic damage at the end of each minute it remains in the cage.

***Doors.*** If the 800-pound stone block holding these doors open is removed, they magically slam shut. It takes a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check to force the doors open. A *knock* spell disrupts the magic briefly, lowering the check DC to 15 for 1 minute.

***Glyph Keys.*** The wight and the deathlock wight each have a glyph key attuned to this zone. The deathlock wight's key is also attuned to all the zones in the Ooze Grottos.

***White Gate.*** The exit to the north has a white gate that connects with the Warrior Pools.

### Clay Golem Kilns
Red Wizards have twisted this zone's magic toward the creation of clay golems.

#### 89. Transmutation Pits

>>Two sides of this chamber have collapsed to form shallow, rough-walled pits filled with clay. Near the northern and southern corners are circles of sigils that glow with red light.
>>
>>In the eastern corner is a small array of urns and boxes. Above them on the wall is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **transmuter** works here with a dwarf cleric of Grumbar, a deity associated with caverns and earth. The dwarf assists in the creation of clay golems, which require divine spellcasting. The dwarf **priest**, whose name is **Gorvan Ironheart**, was recruited by the Red Wizards and offered a substantial sum of money for assistance in crafting the golems. If he is questioned, he lies, claiming to be a prisoner of the Red Wizards. If the characters spare him, he accompanies the party until he sees an opportunity to escape.

Also present is a **reduced-threat clay golem** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above). The wizard or the cleric can activate the golem by using an action and succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence check.

***Clay Pits.*** These 3-foot-deep pits channel powerful transmutation magic that converts rock walls and floor to clay for use in golem construction. The soft clay is difficult terrain.

A creature that starts its turn in a clay pit must succeed on a DC 13 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (creature's choice) or take 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage and become restrained in the clay until the start of its next turn. A creature can escape the clay by succeeding on the saving throw or by taking an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check or Dexterity check. Another creature can try to pull a restrained creature free by taking an action to do so and succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. A creature that dies while trapped in the clay is transformed into a rough clay statue.

***Teleportation Circles.*** Set into the floor, these magic teleportation circles have been partially disabled. A creature that enters a circle's area is pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone. The first time a creature does so on a turn, the creature takes 5 (2d4) force damage.

***Treasure.*** In the eastern corner are a few jars of rare oils and boxes of rare powders used in the creation of the golems, along with some empty containers. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that these materials, which weigh 15 pounds, are worth 3,000 gp.

***Glyph Key.*** The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gate.*** The corridor leading west contains a white gate, which leads to the Flesh Golem Mortuaries.

#### 90. Golem Pen

>>Pillars of white marble glow with an intense white light that brightly illuminates the area. The light is so bright that it almost obscures the arcane glyphs carved in the archways that lead into the room.
>>

***Pillars of Light.*** The intense bright light, created by evocation magic in the pillars, causes disadvantage on ranged attack rolls and ability checks made to search or see in this area. In addition, whenever a creature starts its turn in the chamber proper (not in an entryway next to the glyphs), it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the start of its next turn.

***Arcane Glyphs.*** In the entryways, arcane glyphs on the wall can be used to control the pillars. When someone touches the glyphs, the pillars flicker. It takes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check to understand exactly how the glyphs function. A *detect magic* spell shows that the abjuration aura of the glyphs is connected to the evocation magic of the pillars, thereby revealing the function of the glyphs without a check.

A character who understands how the glyphs work can take an action to touch the glyphs and subdue the pillars with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check or deactivate them with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Subdued pillars shine less intensely for 1 minute, and the DC for the saving throw against them becomes 8. While the pillars are subdued, golems in this area regain 5 (2d4) hit points at the start of each of their turns. Deactivated pillars go dark for 1 minute, then are subdued for another minute, and then return to normal function.

***Creatures.*** A **clay golem** in this area activates the first time a character fails a saving throw against the pillars, deactivates them, or subdues them.

***White Gates.*** The corridor to the west has a white gate that provides access to the Flesh Golem Mortuaries. The passage heading southeast has a white gate that connects with the Stone Golem Quarries.

#### 91. Hall of Skulls
Three of the skulls here connect to corridors, which the Thayans simply avoid. Characters who approach this room see the following.

>>Ahead is a broad archway of dimly glowing green stone. Inside it is a field of dead gray mist.
>>

Any creature that moves within 5 feet of the mist must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled into it and shunted violently into *area 91*, falling prone and taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

Inside the room is the following scene.

>>Six enormous fiendish skulls are set into the walls of this vast rectangular hall, two on each long side and one on each short side. Each skull is twenty feet high and carved of dimly glowing green stone, and it has a wide-open fanged mouth filled with dead gray mist.
>>
>>In the center of the chamber is a black gate.
>>

***Fiendish Skulls.*** The fiendish skulls are imbued with powerful magic. When any character steps into a skull's mouth, macabre laughter erupts from the northwest corner. The character is teleported to the mouth of a different skull (roll a d6) and comes tumbling back into the room, falling prone and taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

The character must then succeed on a DC 15 saving throw (the ability is tied to the skull's number; see the table) or suffer the skull's curse. The curses are cumulative, imposing a −1d4 penalty to checks and saving throws of the indicated ability. If a character has a penalty of −5 or greater to a single ability, the character also suffers the curse's secondary effect.

| Skull | Ability | Secondary Effect |
|:---:|:---:|---|
| 1 | Strength | Fall prone whenever hit by an attack |
| 2 | Constitution | Reduce hit point maximum to three-quarters of normal |
| 3 | Dexterity | Move at half speed or fall prone at the end of the movement |
| 4 | Intelligence | Unable to speak or understand languages |
| 5 | Wisdom | Unable to perceive anything more than 30 feet away |
| 6 | Charisma | Gain the Stench trait of a **troglodyte** |

***Secret Door.*** In the northwest corner, 20 feet above the floor, a secret door is hidden. The door is nearly impossible to find from the floor, requiring a successful DC 30 Wisdom (Perception) check. The smooth wall is hard to climb without aid, but the vaulted ceiling provides places where a grappling hook might catch.

Beyond the secret door, a teleportation circle set into the floor of a small chamber glows with a deep red light. A creature that steps into the circle is teleported into one of the two circles in *area 89* (determine randomly).

***Black Gate.*** Because it must be activated before it can be used, the black gate here doesn't exude shadowy energy. Any character who successfully assesses the gate knows that it must be activated and how to do so. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check while holding a glyph key, which need not be attuned to this zone, can reactivate the gate. The DC decreases by 2 each time a character in the room enters the mouth of a fiendish skull. Once the gate reactivates, it also attunes the activator's glyph key to this zone.

***White Gates.*** Each of the corridors on the southeast wall has a white gate. One connects with the Stone Golem Quarries, the other with the Iron Golem Foundries.

### Stone Golem Quarries
The Red Wizards have manipulated this zone's magic to enable the creation of stone golems.

#### 92. Timeless Prison

>>A statue of an angelic female stands on a raised dais in the center of this chamber, the walls of which glow dimly with golden light. Six cracked pillars support the crumbling ceiling, each carved in its lower portions to resemble a four-armed gargoyle shrieking in rage.
>>
>>To the northeast is a black gate.
>>

***Light.*** When the characters first enter this area, the walls give off dim light.

***Creatures.*** When any non-undead creature enters this area (which the Thayans avoid), a **four-armed gargoyle** (as a normal **gargoyle** with 63 hit points and one extra claw attack, for a total of three attacks, with Multiattack) emerges from a random pillar and attacks. At the start of each round thereafter, another random pillar transforms until all six gargoyles have emerged.

Because the Red Wizards are drawing off the magic in this area to create stone golems, the ceiling is close to giving way. Whenever a gargoyle emerges from a pillar, crumbling stone falls from the ceiling above that pillar, making the area around the pillar difficult terrain. Any creature next to the pillar must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.

![[017-totyp-05-17.png|right|300]]

***Deva Statue.*** Anyone who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the statue as that of a **deva**.

The last gargoyle to appear uses its initial action to touch the statue, which ends the curse that holds the creature in stasis. This deva's name is **Lumalia**. After she is freed, the walls shed bright light instead of dim. The deva shrieks, unable to act until her turn, at which point she attacks the nearest creatures. (The gargoyles avoid her.)

A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check understands that the deva is crazed from captivity. The characters can try to influence her to direct her attacks against the gargoyles, but doing so takes a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to calm her and refocus her attention. Once she is lucid and able to talk to the characters, she vows to aid them by sowing chaos through the Doomvault on her own.

**Lumalia** decides that her first task will be to inflict justice upon the Thayans. She is immortal, but her anger and regret over the time she has lost during her imprisonment seems very humanlike. In the thick of combat, she can become lost in her thirst for vengeance on the current owners of the Doomvault. **Lumalia** was lawful good when she was imprisoned, but she is now chaotic good.

***Dungeon State.*** The magic of the Doomvault resonates within **Lumalia**. She needs no glyph key to move through the magic gates in the dungeon, although she can't take others with her. If she is freed, her resonance creates feedback in the gate system, making it harder to find intruders in the dungeon, and the Doomvault's alert level decreases by 1.

***White Gates.*** The corridor leading west has a white gate that connects with *area 83* in the Blood Pools. In the corridor to the south and west, a white gate leads to *area 84* in the Blood Pools.

#### 93. Stone Quarry
If the giants occupy this area, the sounds of their labor are audible from either doorway even with the doors closed.

>>A deep pit surrounded by loose rock and rubble scars the smooth marble floor of this chamber. A heavy rope descending into the pit is connected to a system of winches and pulleys.
>>

***Creatures.*** One **stone giant** operates the pulley system to haul stone out of the pit while a second giant cuts stone away from the pit walls. Both are occupied with their noisy work.

The giants joined the Dread Legion willingly, but they hate their duties. Initially, they relish the chance to take their wrath out on the party, but they listen to offers of freedom. They need a glyph key to leave the dungeon.

***Pit.*** Filled with rubble, which is difficult terrain, the pit is 30 feet deep with rough, gently sloped sides. The ropes and pulleys above the pit are attached to a gigantic bucket used to transport the rock. It takes a successful DC 15 Strength check to raise the bucket when it is filled with stone.

***Rubble.*** The area within 10 feet of the pit is full of rock debris, so it is difficult terrain.

#### 94. Golem Assembly
If the Thayans are here, the sounds of their labor are audible from any open hallway leading into the room.

>>White stones frame the four open archways that lead into this chamber. The four stones at the corners of each arch pulse with white light. The walls in this vast space areset with panels of copper that reflect the lights, revealing several piles of stone blocks on the floor.
>>
>>A contact stone is located in the eastern corner of the room.
>>

***Glowing Archways.*** Any creature that steps through one of the four archways that open into this chamber is hurled 10 feet into the room. The first time a creature does so on a turn, the creature must also succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) force damage and fall prone.

Touching any one of an archway's four glowing stones causes that stone to change color for 1 round. Number the stones from 1 to 4 and make the players specify which stones are touched. Select colors as you see fit, pretending to consult your notes each time. (The color changes have no effect on the encounter.)

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **transmuter** and two **Thayan apprentices** are distracted by their work here shaping a **reduced-threat stone golem** (see "*Reduced-Threat Monsters*" above), but they do notice if anyone is hurled into the room. These apprentices are armed with light hammers instead of daggers. The wizard can activate the golem by succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check made as an action.

***Stone Piles.*** The 3-foot-high piles of rough stone blocks are difficult terrain.

***Copper Panels.*** If a creature touches a copper panel, the creature takes 2 (1d4) lightning damage, and the archway stones flash. Until the end of the creature's next turn, it can pass through any archway in this room without being pushed or taking damage. The Thayans know that touching a panel with a wooden item or some other nonconductor provides the benefit of the panel without causing damage.

***Treasure.*** Each Thayan has a fine chisel (worth 50 gp). At the feet of the golem are a few jars of rare oils and boxes of rare powders. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that these materials, which weigh 10 pounds, are worth 2,500 gp.

***Glyph Key.*** The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gates.*** The exits to the northwest and northeast both hold white gates that connect with areas 90 and 91 in the Clay Golem Kilns. The passage to the southeast has a white gate that leads to the Iron Golem Foundries.

### Iron Golem Foundries
Deadly elemental fire fuels the creation of iron golems to serve the Red Wizards. The roar of flames is audible throughout this zone, and firelight provides illumination in many places.

#### 95. Efreet Prison
Characters approaching this area can hear the roar of flames.

>>A low, round pool of molten material sits at the center of this chamber. Tendrils of smoke curl up from it, moving in unnatural ways. In three of the corners stand several red urns, most of them cracked and empty but a few still closed and glowing with eldritch glyphs.
>>

***Gout of Flame.*** A gout of flame blocks the passage that leads to *area 97*. A creature can jump over the flame easily but takes 2 (1d4) fire damage when doing so. A creature that enters the flame during its turn, or starts its turn there, takes 21 (6d6) fire damage.

***Creatures.*** An **efreeti** is bound to the smoke at the center of the room. It can't leave this area or use its powers against anyone outside the room.

***Binding Smoke.*** The smoke tendrils form chains that have no solidity, but their abjuration magic holds the efreeti in this area. While it is bound in this smoke, the creature is susceptible to the *charm person* spell and has disadvantage on the saving throw. If it isn't charmed, the efreeti orders anyone present to grant it freedom and attacks if its demand isn't met.

The efreeti has no means to break the binding smoke. It knows, however, that the feat can be accomplished with spells, such as *dispel magic* (save DC 17), *gust of wind*, *knock*, or any spell that can push the efreeti out of the area of the pool. The smoke dissipates if the efreeti is slain.

***Molten Pool.*** The pool has a 3-foot-high wall. A creature that enters the pool for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 35 (10d6) fire damage.

***Urns.*** Two unbroken funeral urns stand in each corner. Glyphs in the Primordial language on the urns suggest that they are binding vessels for efreet, and *detect magic* reveals that they have an aura of abjuration. The wax-seal stopper of an urn is broken easily, and an urn can be broken like any clay vessel of the sort. When an urn is opened or broken, the act releases a gas that causes any creature within 10 feet of the urn to gain resistance to fire damage for 1 hour. Each urn is 1 foot tall and weighs 5 pounds.

***Dungeon State.*** The magic of the Doomvault resonates within the efreeti, which has been here since before the Thayans came to power in the dungeon. It needs no glyph keys to move through the gates in the dungeon but can't enable others to accompany it. If it is freed, the efreeti rampages through the dungeon, preferring Thayan targets.

***White Gate.*** The opening on the northwest wall contains a white gate that connects with the Clay Golem Kilns.

#### 96. Fire Vortex

>>This rough cavern splits off from the smooth walls of the adjacent chamber. Its floor is covered in a layer of ash.
>>

***Ash.*** Elemental ash covers the floor to a depth of 6 inches, concealing how uneven the floor is. This entire area is difficult terrain.

***Cavern Walls.*** The extremely rough walls make it possible to traverse the cavern horizontally without touching the floor.

***Elemental Vortex.*** When any creature moves onto the floor at the center of the cavern, the walls suddenly erupt in a maelstrom of elemental fire that lasts for 5 rounds. Any creature that starts its turn in the cavern during this time must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### 97. Golem Forge

>>At the center of this fiery hall is a huge crucible that emits vapors. Dozens of molds and piles of armor plate are spread out before six hulking armored figures that stand along the walls.
>>
>>To the southwest is a black gate. North of the gate is a contact stone.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **conjurer** and two **Thayan apprentices** work on an inactive iron golem in this area.

A charmed **efreeti** (see *area 95*) is at work boiling metal in the crucible. The efreeti fights for its Thayan friends. If freed of the charmed condition, it snatches up a falchion intended for the golem and attacks the Thayans. If the efreeti is alive when the other foes in the area are slain, it rampages like its kin in *area 95*.

***Crucible.*** The 5-foot-high crucible contains molten metal. As an action, a creature can attempt to spill the contents by tipping the crucible over, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage in the process. On a successful DC 15 Strength check, the crucible tips, and on a successful DC 20 Strength check, a creature can also push the crucible 5 feet before it tips. Molten metal quickly spreads from the mouth of the crucible over an *area 30* feet by 30 feet in size, including the crucible and the space within 5 feet of it.

Anyone caught in the molten metal takes 21 (6d6) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall prone. The floor of the area is covered in molten metal. For the next 5 rounds, a creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. For 5 rounds after that, the damage is 3 (1d6), and then it drops to none.

***Fire Vent.*** See *area 95*.

***Treasure.*** A search of the molds throughout the room reveals vials of rare tinctures and admixtures used in the construction of iron golems. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that these materials, which weigh 30 pounds, are worth 5,000 gp.

***Glyph Key.*** The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

***White Gates.*** At the top of the stairs to the south is a white gate that connects with the Forest of Death. The corridor that leads northwest has a white gate that leads to the Stone Golem Quarries.

## Temples of Extraction
The so-called "Temples of Extraction" are profane laboratories that fuel Szass Tam's schemes for ascending to godhood. Szass Tam and his closest associates have reshaped this sector's magic to collect the divine essence of the Chosen of various deities. The Thayan regent believes that this essence may be the key to becoming a god.

Locations in the Temples of Extraction are identified on map 5.11.

![[018-dit11.png|right|300]]

***Creatures.*** The Thayans here are the most loyal and fanatical servants of Szass Tam. They all know that no one is authorized to be in this sector, so the characters have a hard time fooling them. Except for the cowardly Red Wizard Shalok (*area 103*), the Thayans in this sector are unlikely to surrender and are unwilling to help intruders even at the cost of their lives.

The Red Wizards in this sector might feign surrender to put the characters off their guard. For example, they might fall to their knees and hold up their hands. Then, when the characters close in, the wizards cast area spells that include themselves and the party.

If a shrine of binding (see below) exudes a magical effect to which creatures in the room can become inured, the creatures that guard the shrine are already immune to the effect.

***Doors.*** All the doors in this sector are locked.

***Random Encounters.*** No random encounters occur in the Temples of Extraction.

***Black Gates.*** Only four external glyph keys (one for each zone, in areas 10, 25, 31, and 63) allow access to the gates in this sector. Some Red Wizards here carry glyph keys to their zones and guard them zealously.

***Contact Stones.*** There are no contact stones in this sector.

#### Shrines of Binding
Each chamber of this zone features an identical 3-foot-high shrine whose arcane power extracts energy from a Chosen creature that is strapped to the shrine. This energy is what powers the Doomvault but, even more, is also what both creates and keeps hidden the Phylactery Vault. The characters will have to examine the shrines to determine how these abilities function.

When the characters see a shrine of binding for the first time, use the following description.

>>A three-step stone dais is set with four pillars, all carved of black jet. Glowing arcane runes surround the top edge of this shrine. Between the pillars, an unconscious humanoid is suspended in a roiling field of golden light.
>>

Thereafter, you can shorten the description of the shrine, but be sure to specifically describe the Chosen that is bound inside it.

***Entering a Shrine.*** While there is someone trapped on the shrine, the whole structure is surrounded by a tangible magical energy. Stepping onto the shrine requires a successful DC 10 Charisma check, and unless this check succeeds by 5 or more, the shrine counts as difficult terrain. On a failed check, the creature is knocked prone next to the shrine and takes 5 (2d4) force damage.

***Effects of a Shrine.*** Channeling the energy of the trapped Chosen, each shrine creates magical effects and light within its area (see each area descriptions for details) and throughout the complex—in particular they help to obfuscate the location of the Phylactery Vault. A successful DC 10 Wisdom check allows a character to intuit the effects of a working shrine, including how it channels the life essence of the trapped Chosen to another place and how to disable it. When a shrine is disabled, its magical effect in the area ends, and the Chosen bound inside it is freed.

***Disabling a Shrine.*** The process for disabling a shrine is the same in each area. Characters who are standing on the shrine may disable its magic by making three successful DC 15 ability checks: Strength to smash the pillars, Dexterity to remove elements and disable key arcane runes, or Intelligence to disrupt the flow of magical energy. A character can make multiple checks of the same type or any combination. On any failed check, the character who attempted the check is pushed off the shrine and knocked prone next to it, taking 5 (2d4) force damage.

***Reaching the Phylactery Vault.*** Once a Shrine of Binding has been disabled, a character who closely examines the shrine and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check discerns how these shrines and the black gates in this sector work together to shield the Phylactery Vault. The character understands that if the black gates in the Temples of Extraction can be overloaded, those gates will attune themselves to the location where the power of the Chosen is being directed—the vault itself.

In order to create that overload, six black gates in other sectors must be disrupted simultaneously (as described at the beginning of this adventure). Once that is accomplished, any glyph key can be used on any of the black gates in the Temples of Extraction, and the user will be taken to the Phylactery Vault.

#### The Chosen
In each area of the Temples of Extraction, one of the Chosen of the gods is being drained to grant power to Szass Tam. Some of these Chosen would be deadly adversaries, but the binding ordeal leaves most of them physically and mentally weakened to the point that they pose no real danger. The Chosen have no memory of how they came to be in the Doomvault, so they can offer no information about the dungeon.

Many of the helpless Chosen are thoroughly evil, and good-aligned characters might balk at seeing them freed. Take advantage of this situation to create opportunities for interesting interactions.

If combat statistics become necessary, a helpless Chosen has AC 10, has 5 hit points, and makes checks and saving throws with a +0 modifier. If you plan to use this adventure in a continuing campaign, killing a helpless Chosen can later bring the characters into conflict with other agents of that Chosen's deity.

The magic of the Doomvault resonates within all of the Chosen. A Chosen needs no glyph key to move through the gates in the dungeon, although that individual can't enable others to accompany it.

### Temples of Anguish
The Chosen of deities who are associated with torment have been imprisoned in these chambers.

#### 98. Temple of Poison

>>The air in this white marble chamber hangs heavy with a dark mist that burns the eyes. To the north is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **necromancer** works here, guarded by a **helmed horror**. They are immune to the Dark Mist, and the Red Wizard has the Venomous Touch trait (see below).

***Dark Mist.*** The shrine exudes poisonous mist that makes the area lightly obscured. Any creature that starts its turn in the room must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the start of its next turn. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to this effect for a day and gains the following trait. Constructs and undead can't gain this trait.

Venomous Touch. When the creature hits with a weapon attack, that attack also deals 5 (2d4) poison damage.

***Chosen of Zehir.*** The Chosen of Zehir is a male **yuan-ti malison (type 3)** named **Oussa**. Zehir is the serpentine god of poison, darkness, and murder. He is worshiped primarily by yuan-ti. If **Oussa** is rescued and then realizes that the characters aren't Zehir's faithful sent to help him, he uses his unholy power to instantly assume snake form and attacks the party.

***Glyph Key.*** The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this zone.

#### 99. Temple of Suffering

>>Stripes of red mist appear in the air in this white marble chamber, as if someone is whipping the air and it is bleeding.
>>

![[019-totyp-05-19.png|right|300]]

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **enchanter** and a **Thayan apprentice** work here, guarded by two **dread warriors**.

The Red Wizard here is **Mennek Ariz**, the rebel wizard who helped assault the Bloodgate. He was captured during the assault and brainwashed. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check can discern that he isn't acting of his own volition. Only magic, such as *dispel magic* or *charm person*, can break the effect. If he is freed of the brainwashing, Mennek can reveal two pieces of lore.

***Suffering Aura.*** Whenever a creature in this room deals damage to one or more creatures, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to one-quarter of the greatest amount of damage it dealt to a single target. If the save succeeds, the attacker instead regains a number of hit points equal to one-quarter of the greatest amount of damage it dealt to a single target.

***Chosen of Ilmater.*** The Chosen of Ilmater is a lawful good male human named **Kieren**. Ilmater, also known as the Crying God, is the god of suffering, martyrdom, and perseverance. He offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, oppressed, or in great need.

***Treasure.*** Mennek carries a *wand of binding*.

***Keys.*** Mennek has a glyph key attuned to this zone, as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the doors in this zone.

***White Gates.*** Behind the doors to the south is a white gate that leads to the Temples of Turmoil. The eastern doors open onto a white gate that connects with the Temples of Oppression.

#### 100. Temple of Pain

>>A tangible feeling of unease and discomfort fills the air of this scarred marble chamber.
>>

***Creatures.*** A **deathlock wight** keeps watch here. One **wraith** and four **shadows** circle around the shrine, streaks of crimson trailing from their spectral forms.

***Web of Pain.*** Whenever a non-undead creature in this area takes damage, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature makes attack rolls, Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and ability checks with disadvantage until the end of its next turn. In addition, others make attack rolls against the creature with advantage until the end of its next turn.

***Chosen of Loviatar.*** The Chosen of Loviatar is a lawful evil female half-elf named **Irisoth**. Loviatar, the Maiden of Pain, is the god of hurt and agony, and the patron of torturers. Loviatar teaches that the world is filled with pain and torment, and the best that one can do is to suffer those blows that can't be avoided, and then deal as much pain back to those who offend.

### Temples of Oppression
The dark of living night and deadly abominations fuels the shrines in the Temples of Oppression.

#### 101. Temple of Ooze

>>The walls in this hexagonal hall of gleaming gray marble shudder occasionally. To the northeast is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **transmuter** works here, with a **wight** leading two **sentient gray oozes** and two **sentient ochre jellies** to guard her. Sentient oozes are the same as normal versions of such monsters, except that they have Intelligence 5, can understand basic communication in Common, and are no longer immune to being charmed. Myrra, the Red Wizard, is especially cruel and likely to toy with the characters even when she is losing.

***Ooze Walls.*** The first time a creature moves within 15 feet of any wall on a turn, that act provokes an opportunity attack as if made by a gray ooze with a reach of 15 feet. The attack roll is made with advantage.

***Chosen of Ghaunadaur.*** The Chosen of Ghaunadaur is a sickly and chaotic evil male drow named **Therzt**. Ghaunadaur is a strange god worshiped primarily by male drow that seek power outside the confines of a society dominated by females. Ghaunadaur is a malignant and unknowable deity that desires living sacrifice and destruction due to monstrous causes, particularly oozes.

If he is freed, **Therzt** babbles about the weakness he demonstrated in being captured and declares that he must die. As an action, **Therzt** casts *Melf's acid arrow* on himself while screaming his devotion to Ghaunadaur. The acid consumes him utterly as unholy energy pulses out to touch the walls, producing two **gray oozes** at the center point of each wall. The oozes treat all creatures remaining here as prey.

***Keys.*** The Red Wizard has a glyph key attuned to this zone, as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the doors in this zone.

***White Gate.*** Beyond the doors to the west is a white gate that leads to the Temples of Anguish.

#### 102. Temple of Shadows
***Light.*** This area has no light sources. Bright light from a source other than a spell of 3rd level or higher becomes dim light if it is produced in or carried into this chamber.

>>The shrine of binding takes up a large portion of this black marble chamber.
>>

***Creatures.*** Six **shadows** lurk here.

***Poisoned Shadows.*** Whenever a non-undead creature in this area takes damage, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (2d4) poison damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Chosen of Ibrandul.*** The Chosen of Ibrandul is a chaotic evil female drow named **Ashdra**. Ibrandul is a god of darkness and underground places once primarily worshiped by humans in southern lands such as Calimshan. He was worshiped as a comforter and protector of those who travel and work in darkness.

***White Gate.*** The doors to the south open onto a corridor that runs southwest and joins with two other passages. At the junction is a white gate that connects with the Temples of Turmoil and with the Temples of Nature.

### Temples of Turmoil
The magic of Szass Tam turns different facets of chaos to absolute evil in these great halls.

#### 103. Temple of Fortune

>>A pattern of shadow swirls around a shrine of binding and plays out across the white-and-gold marble floor of this hall. To the west is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **necromancer** works here, guarded by a **flesh golem**. Shalok, the Red Wizard, is a coward. If the fight goes badly for him, he surrenders. He offers his skeleton key and one piece of lore if he's allowed to flee to the gatehouse.

***Curse of Fortune.*** High and low d20 results matter more in this area:

- A creature that rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll takes the damage from its attack.
- A creature that scores a critical hit can roll the extra damage die twice instead of just once.
- A creature that rolls a 1 on a saving throw suffers the worst possible effect, such as maximum damage from a spell.
- If a creature rolls a 20 on a saving throw, the creator of the effect that caused the saving throw suffers the effect instead.
- If a creature rolls a 1 on an ability check, it suffers the worst possible outcome of the attempted action.
- If a creature rolls a 20 on an ability check, it accomplishes a particularly spectacular and favorable outcome.

***Chosen of Tymora.*** The Chosen of Tymora is a chaotic good male halfling named **Curran Corvalin**. Tymora is the goddess of good fortune, skill, and victory. She is the patron of all who take risks. Although considered to be a good deity who favors those who take bold action, she is also seen as somewhat capricious.

Curran was captured by the Red Wizards a few weeks ago. He never considered himself to be a Chosen of Tymora, since he never had any special powers. He always just assumed he had unnaturally good luck.

Curran is eager to return home, but he is too weak to help the party. If taken to the gatehouse, he awaits the party's triumph there.

***Keys.*** Shalok has a glyph key attuned to this zone, as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the doors in this zone.

#### 104. Temple of Savagery

>>This chamber of red marble rings with the dying screams of humanoids. The sounds arouse feelings of violence.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **evoker** has command over two **dread warriors** here. A **shadow** lurks at each pillar on the shrine of binding, for a total of four.

***Curse of Bloodlust.*** If combat occurs in this area, a creature takes 5 (2d4) psychic damage at the end of each of its turns when it doesn't deal damage to another creature.

***Curse of Betrayal.*** Any creature that ends its turn in this area must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature treats all other creatures as enemies for the purpose of opportunity attacks and makes any opportunity attack available to it, with advantage on the attack roll, until the end of the creature's next turn. It can use no other reactions during this time.

***Chosen of Bhaal.*** This shrine contains a Chosen of Bhaal named **Torlin Silvershield**, who was formerly a duke of Baldur's Gate. He has become a **wight**. The creature hisses an oath to Bhaal and attacks characters who free it.

Bhaal is the Lord of Murder and a patron of assassins.

***White Gate.*** The doors on the eastern wall open onto a corridor that joins with two other passages. At the junction is a white gate that connects with the Temples of Oppression and with the Temples of Nature.

### Temples of Nature
The power of nature is stripped down to its most destructive core in this zone.

#### 105. Temple of Plague

>>A glowing green mist drifts around a shrine of binding in this white marble chamber. To the southwest is a black gate.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **necromancer** and a **deathlock wight** work here, guarded by a **dread warrior** and four **zombies**. Thutai, the Red Wizard, is the overseer of this sector. He cares little for his underlings, including them in area effects if it means harming more characters. If the fight goes badly, he uses the black gate to flee.

***Curse of Death.*** Characters have disadvantage on death saving throws while in this area.

***Plague Mist.*** The shrine exudes poisonous mist that makes the area lightly obscured. Each creature that starts its turn in the room must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (2d4) poison damage and spends its turn incapacitated and retching. If a creature accumulates three failed saves against this mist, its hit point maximum is lowered by the amount of poison damage it has taken from the mist. A creature that makes three successful saving throws against the mist becomes immune to its effects for 4 hours.

***Chosen of Yurtrus.*** The Chosen of Yurtrus is a neutral evil male orc named **Bandagh**. Yurtrus is the orc deity of disease, decay, rot, and death. Orcs fear Yurtrus, and his priests have protected status in the tribe even though they are often weak or infirm in some way. **Bandagh** is pockmarked from years of disease, and is in no condition to pick a fight if he is freed.

***Treasure.*** Thutai wears *bracers of defense* and has *spell scrolls* of *remove curse* and *speak with dead*.

***Keys.*** Thutai has a glyph key attuned to every zone in this sector, as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the doors in this zone.

***White Gate.*** The doors on the western wall open onto a corridor that joins with two other passages. At the junction is a white gate that connects with the Temples of Oppression and with the Temples of Turmoil.

#### 106. Temple of the Forest

>>Gnarled vines thrust from the rough floor of this green cavern, and roots dangle from the ceiling. The vines move as if in a breeze, though you feel no such thing.
>>

***Creatures.*** A **wraith** and three **will-o'-wisps** guard this chamber. The wisps start out invisible.

***Clutching Vines.*** While on the ground, a creature that moves more than half its speed or misses with a melee attack causes the branches within 5 feet to elongate and grasp. Each creature on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or become restrained in the vines. The area becomes difficult terrain. A restrained creature can take an action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself on a success.

***Chosen of Rillifane Rallathil.*** A neutral good female wood elf **druid** named **Eira** is the Chosen of Rillifane Rallathil, the elven god of the woodlands and of the harmony of nature. He is seen as a calm and steady deity, quite unlike his more mercurial fellow elven deities.

As part of the experiments in this sector, **Eira** has been infused with the essence of a Chosen of Talona who was sacrificed. The binding process has left **Eira** at half her hit points but otherwise in good shape. She begs to accompany the characters in the fight against the Red Wizards.

If **Eira** joins the party, when she enters combat, the Talona side surfaces and contests for control. She argues out loud with herself, and half the time she acts evilly and without concern for her saviors. While talking to herself, she reveals what happened to her as well as one piece of lore. If **Eira** drops to 0 hit points, she disintegrates, her body turning to ash.

#### 107. Temple of Winter

>>A blast of freezing air comes through the open doors to this chamber, where the walls are covered with ice.
>>

***Creatures.*** A Red Wizard **evoker** and a **Thayan apprentice** work here, with three trained **yetis** as bodyguards. Aduna, the Red Wizard, and her apprentice prefer to stand near the braziers.

***Braziers.*** The magic stone braziers are built into the room and can't be moved. A creature that touches a brazier for the first time on a turn takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.

***Chill Metal Aura.*** A creature within 10 feet of a brazier ignores this effect. Any other creature wielding a metal weapon or wearing metal armor must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns or take 5 (2d4) cold damage. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature has disadvantage on Strength- and Dexterity-based attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the start of its next turn.

***Chosen of Auril.*** The Chosen of Auril is a chaotic evil female human named **Hedrun Arnsfirth**. Auril is a callous and cold-hearted bringer of winter. Most humans propitiate Auril with offerings or prayers when the first frosts come and curse her name during blizzards.

Hedrun is now a **deathlock wight**. If freed, she screams an oath to Auril and attacks the characters.

***Treasure.*** Aduna wears a *robe of summer*.

***Keys.*** Aduna has a glyph key attuned to this zone, as well as a skeleton key that unlocks all the doors in this zone.

## The Phylactery Vault
Once the characters disrupt six black gates throughout the dungeon, they can use the gates in the Temples of Extraction to travel to the Phylactery Vault. Before they make that journey, Syranna uses *sending* to call the characters back to the gatehouse and brief them on their final task. Syranna interacts with the party as follows:

>>Syranna's image appears before you and speaks.
>>
>>"Hello again," she says. "I confess that I'm surprised at how well you have persevered. Your actions have significantly disrupted activity in the Doomvault. But the task is not yet complete.
>>
>>"You have a chance to deal a heavy blow to Szass Tam and the liches of Thay. The black gates have been disrupted, allowing entry into a chamber deep beneath the Doomvault. Accessible only by magic, this room is called the Phylactery Vault because it houses the phylacteries of many of Szass Tam's high-ranking lich servants.
>>
>>"You must enter the vault, defeat its guardians, and disrupt the magic there. You can enter through any black gate in the Temples of Extraction when you are ready."
>>

The characters can ask questions, but at best Syranna knows only a little more than they do. (You can use this opportunity to give out information you want the players to know before proceeding.)

### Entering the Vault
The Phylactery Vault is a tetrahedral space—like standing inside a hollow pyramid—and the characters are inside that space when they arrive. Each face of the vault has its own gravity. In effect, every surface is a floor. See the "Gravity" section for more details.

Maps 5.12 and 5.13 depict the inside of the Phylactery Vault and indicate how those floors connect with the other surfaces. The characters arrive on floor 1.

![[021-dit13.jpg|right|300]](Map 5.13: The Phylactery Vault - Floor 3 & Floor 4)Begin by describing the area:

>>The vast, four-sided pyramidal space has a floor of rough-hewn white marble set with low circular pedestals of the same material. At the three corners of the floor stand sepulchers of white marble, each a three-sided pyramid that mirrors the shape of the vault. Engraved into each sepulcher's double doors is a four-armed gargoyle, poised to attack. A pool of dark liquid churns in the center of the floor.
>>
>>Each other surface of the vault is nearly identical. Rubble of black rock scattered near the wall and the pool on each side stay in place. It seems apparent that each side has its own gravity.
>>

Make sure the players understand the relative gravity of each floor.

***Adjacent Floors.*** The directions that lead to other floors in the vault are indicated on the map for floors 1 and 2.

If the characters are on floor 3, they can reach floor 1 by traveling north, floor 4 by going southwest, and floor 1 by traveling southeast.

If the characters are on floor 4, they can reach floor 3 by traveling south, floor 1 by going northwest, and floor 2 by traveling northeast.

### General Features
Each floor inside the Phylactery Vault has the following features.

***Dark Pools.*** A dark pool is 1 foot deep and difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in a dark pool takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. A creature in a dark pool can't regain hit points.

***Pedestals.*** The 3-foot-high pedestals store radiant energy, which is released in the presence of undead intruders. If an undead creature other than Kazit Gul ends its turn within 5 feet of a pedestal, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or take 11 (2d10) radiant damage.

***Rubble Piles.*** Along the edge of each floor, a pile of loose chunks of black marble rises to a height of 3 feet as it crosses to the adjacent floor. This rubble is difficult terrain.

***Sepulchers.*** The double doors to these tetrahedral pyramids are locked (requiring a successful DC 17 Dexterity check to pick the lock or a successful DC 20 Strength check to burst it). If either of the two doors on a sepulcher is opened, each door on that sepulcher transforms into a **four-armed gargoyle** (as a normal gargoyle with 63 hit points and one extra claw attack, for a total of three attacks, with Multiattack) and attacks.

Within each sepulcher is a set of phylacteries. See the "Phylacteries" section.

#### Gravity
Each floor in the vault's tetrahedral space has its own gravity. This phenomenon also has the following effects.

***Flying.*** A creature flying from one floor to land on another must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone upon landing.

***Ranged Attacks.*** Due to the weird gravity, creatures have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls made against targets on a different floor.

***Moving between Floors.*** The edges of the tetrahedron are lined with piles of rubble. Crossing to the rubble pile onto an adjacent floor requires a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failed check, the creature falls prone in that rubble pile.

#### Phylacteries
Within each sepulcher is a scene like the following:

>>The sepulcher walls hum with arcane power. On stone shelves are leather cases, amulets, daggers, scroll tubes, unholy symbols, and other ornate objects. These are the phylacteries of Szass Tam's lich servants.
>>

The phylacteries can't be harmed while they are protected by the magic of the sepulcher. However, a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check made while examining a sepulcher reveals that disrupting the flow of eldritch energy within a sepulcher will disable the structure.

Disrupting the energy flow requires intense concentration. It takes three successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks performed by a character who is proficient in that skill and is touching the target sepulcher. On each failed check, the character takes force damage equal to the amount by which the check failed. After making one check, a character realizes that every glyph key he or she holds will grant a +1 bonus to the check.

When the group disables its first sepulcher, read:

>>Fountains of shadowy energy burst from the dark pools to form an inky vortex in the open air at the vault's center.
>>
>>A gleaming black humanoid skull flies out of the vortex. It has a ruby in each of its eye sockets and eight oversized glowing diamonds in place of teeth.
>>

#### Kazit Gul
Kazit Gul, a **demilich**, has entered the vault and immediately attacks the characters. If the demilich is destroyed, read:

>>The skull turns to black ash that floats away, and the eight gems embedded in it fall to the ground.
>>

The gems that contain souls gleam with inner light. If such a gem is crushed, the soul is released. The soul departs for the afterlife unless its body is intact and within 10 feet of the crushed gem.

### Endgame
In order to destroy the Phylactery Vault, first Kazit Gul must be destroyed, and then three sepulchers must be disabled. When those conditions are met, the magic coursing through the Phylactery Vault unravels:

>>The white pedestals crumble to rubble and the dark pools dissipate, leaving behind black ash. The vortex overhead collapses, spilling black ash and diamonds onto the floor. Your glyph keys pulse with blue light and subtle vibrations. The black gates begin to pulse in time with the keys.
>>

A character can make a DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check to assess the failing magic and confirm that the Phylactery Vault is collapsing.

If all eight of the demilich's gems have been destroyed when the Phylactery Vault begins to collapse, then Kazit Gul is permanently slain. The characters can hear a distant wail and sense Gul's passing.

At this juncture, the characters' glyph keys allow them to use any black gates to escape this quickly collapsing extradimensional space, but the only place they can go is the gatehouse.

## Aftermath
With the Phylactery Vault destroyed, Syranna is true to her word and uses *teleport* to send the characters (as well as any NPCs they saved from the Doomvault) to a location of their choice. She invites any characters who proved useful, particularly those with arcane talents, to remain in Thay under her leadership. She promises them power and influence if they throw in support for her.

Any fallen characters who were raised as soul-bound undead can't leave the Doomvault without dying permanently. Syranna assures such characters who choose to stay that she will see that they are restored to life, once she gains sufficient power to do so.
