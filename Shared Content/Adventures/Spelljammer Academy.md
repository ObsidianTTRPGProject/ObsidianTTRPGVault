# Spelljammer Academy: Orientation
![[000-01-001.o-sja01-splash.webp|right|300]]

## Introduction
This adventure, designed for **three to seven 1st-level characters**, is the first in a series of four adventures. It is set in Spelljammer Academy on the island of Nimbral, many miles southwest of the Chultan peninsula in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.

### Background
Welcome to Spelljammer Academy! Promising recruits are trained here under the tutelage of experienced spelljammers, who prepare fledgling spacefarers for the perils of Wildspace and the Astral Sea. Cadets learn the finer points of ship-to-ship combat, space exploration, and (in some cases) clandestine operations. The newest batch of recruits has just arrived after a long, arduous sea voyage, but there's still much to do! Although it's business as usual at Spelljammer Academy, the new cadets soon learn that strange things are afoot.

The purpose of this adventure is to introduce the characters to Spelljammer Academy and foreshadow an unknown threat.

### Overview
This adventure takes approximately two hours to play and is split into three parts:

Part 1: Welcome to Wildspace! The recruits undertake a quick combat trial on the Simulations Deck, so that academy personnel can assess their skills.

Part 2: Academy Orientation. After the simulation, the new cadets receive a crash course on the academy's purpose and general layout, as they complete a laundry list of tasks to acclimate to their new home.

Part 3: Intruder Alert! The cadets deliver a crate of supplies to Mirt the Merciless, the head of the academy, but discover that their cargo contains a deadly surprise.

### Adventure Hooks
All the characters have volunteered, for whatever reason, to join Spelljammer Academy: a shadowy enclave of spellcasters and swords-for-hire situated on the remote and mysterious island of Nimbral. While the characters are still encouraged to develop backstories, they should be looking for adventure with few long-term bonds to tie them to their homelands. The campaign takes the characters to the stars and beyond, and there might be no coming back afterward!

*Orientation* throws the characters right into the action. To maximize the impact of part 1 of the adventure, you might choose to downplay initial introductions and discussion of the characters' backstories, bringing up any connections between the characters only after the adventure's initial encounter has been resolved.

## Part 1: Welcome to Wildspace
Spelljammer Academy's newest recruits are brought to the Simulations Deck for a quick combat trial so that academy personnel can assess their skills and readiness. The magic of the Simulations Deck puts a unique spin on the training session, dropping player characters straight into the action.

### Right into the Action
When everyone is ready to begin, roll for initiative. Then read or paraphrase the following aloud:

>>You stand on the deck of your spelljamming ship, *Moonraider*, even as explosions obliterate two of its masts and hurl a dozen of your fellow sailors into Wildspace! Distant stars and wheeling clouds of multicolored gas spin around you as the first pirate galleon slams into *Moonraider*'s starboard side, and a gust of foul wind washes over you as the galleon's air envelope merges with your own. Seconds later, your vessel is boarded by astral reavers—humanoids possessed of strange features, waving cruel weapons, and unleashing blasts of magic.
>>
>>Captain Sardax lies on the deck nearby, her body ruined by shrapnel. "Hold the top deck!" she snarls with her dying breath. "Grant them no quarter!"
>>

This encounter starts in the thick of the action. The characters are in the midst of a magical illusion used to train Spelljammer Academy cadets. The shock of being plunged into the illusory simulation has left them disoriented and unable to sense that what they see is only in their minds. Both the characters and the players should believe that the simulation is real. When your players ask the inevitable questions about how they got here, use the following to guide your answers:

- The characters know that they are crew members on *Moonraider*, but they have no recollection of events prior to the reavers' attack.
- The characters are new members of the crew, making their first journey into Wildspace.
- At a guess, it seems likely that the reavers have used some kind of magic to disorient *Moonraider*'s crew, hoping to make it easier to seize the ship.
- The characters know Captain Sardax and understand that her death leaves it up to them and the other surviving crew members to repel the reavers.
- The characters know and trust each other. *Moonraider* is their ship, and they are bound to defend it!

"Forecastle Map" shows the layout of the area that the characters are defending. They are the only sailors still alive in this section of the ship.

![[001-01-009.o-forecastle.webp|right|300]]

### Fighting the Reavers
At the start of combat, place two astral reavers (**bandits**) at the edge of the forecastle area. Don't roll initiative for these enemies. Instead, all reavers act at the end of the initiative order, after the characters have taken their turns. More reavers then appear during the round (see below).

At the start of each character's turn, roll on the Battle Events table to determine a random event, which can include the appearance of new reavers. As each new enemy appears, roll on the Astral Reavers table to determine a special quality for them, and use these descriptions to help identify specific reavers in combat.

When you've played two full rounds of combat, proceed to the "End Simulation" section below.

##### Battle Events
| d20 | Event |
|:---:|---|
| 1–12 | A new astral reaver (**bandit**) jumps into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the character. |
| 13 | An explosion rocks the ship. Each creature on the deck must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. |
| 14 | A second spelljamming ship soars overhead, raining arrows down on the defenders. Each character must roll a d20. On a roll of 1–9, they are targeted by an arrow (+3 to hit, 3 piercing damage on a hit). |
| 15 | An untended coil of rope slams into the character, unfurling and reducing their speed by half until the end of their turn. |
| 16 | Loose rigging careens across the deck. Choose a character. That character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to grab the rigging and be safely flung to an unoccupied space within 40 feet of their current position. On a failure, they stay where they are and fall prone. |
| 17 | The ship's dog, Bruno, rushes to the aid of a character of the player's choosing. The character can use a reaction to sip once from the healing keg around Bruno's neck (no action required), regaining 1d6 hit points. |
| 18–20 | An allied sailor on the main deck fires an arrow at a reaver (+3 to hit, 5 piercing damage on a hit). |

#### Astral Reavers
The reavers are coal-hearted miscreants united only by the urge to raid and pillage. Each reaver has the statistics of a **bandit** but has a unique appearance determined by the Astral Reavers table.

##### Astral Reavers
| d12 | Appearance |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Serrated iron jaw and mechanical arm ending in oversized pincer |
| 2 | Giant goldfish-bowl head containing a floating brain |
| 3 | Four arms, two of which are used solely to perform threatening or insulting gestures |
| 4 | Iridescent scales and glowing pink eyes |
| 5 | Enormous nose and ears |
| 6 | Helicopter blades mounted on head (flying speed of 10 feet, with a maximum hovering altitude of 3 feet) |
| 7 | Infantile second head that continually spits curses |
| 8 | Burning beard, and breath that reeks of booze |
| 9 | Wears a torn wedding dress stained in blood |
| 10 | Blue-skinned, with a single large horn on forehead |
| 11 | Fishlike features and needlelike teeth |
| 12 | Reflective skin |

### End Simulation
After two full rounds of combat have been resolved, end the combat by reading or paraphrasing the following:

>>A thunderous explosion shakes the ship, filling the air with splinters of wood. Bodies are hurled into Wildspace—and then everything stops. Wreckage hangs motionless. Reavers freeze in the middle of their attacks. Even the stars stop twinkling.
>>
>>The illusion of Wildspace melts away, and you find yourselves in one of the magical chambers of the Simulations Deck, your memories slowly fitting back into place. You recall being warned that your first experience of a Wildspace simulation would be disorienting—to test your ability to function under pressure.
>>
>>A hulking figure emerges from the center of the explosion: a hadozee with a missing wing flap wearing a military uniform bristling with medals. The air around her smells like cigar smoke. "As you can see," Boatswain Tarto growls, "the battle of H'Catha didn't go so well for Captain Sardax and her crew. But her last battle makes a good testing ground for new recruits. End simulation!"
>>

The characters remember meeting the hadozee training officer Boatswain Tarto (see the sidebar), and that the battle has been an illusory exercise conducted in one of the academy's simulation chambers—large circular spaces whose rune-scribed walls channel potent magical power, and which contain training versions of *spelljamming helms* (akin to those used to propel real spelljamming ships). As the simulation ends, all characters regain any lost hit points, spell slots, or limited-use powers. Characters who died during the encounter discover that they were merely unconscious, and each gains one level of exhaustion from lingering psychic shock.

With the training exercise complete, the new recruits are ready for debriefing and orientation. Proceed to "Part 2: Academy Orientation."

![[002-01-002.o-boatswain-tarto.webp|right|300]]

>Boatswain Tarto (Spelljammer Corps Training Officer)
>
>*Hadozee Seasoned Boatswain*
>
>The scars that Boatswain Tarto (pronounced BOE-sun TAR-toe) bears are testament to her status as a battle-hardened veteran. Despite having one of her wing flaps torn away long ago, she remains as capable as ever while on board a ship. Spelljammer Academy has no better person to spearhead the training of raw recruits—and Tarto knows it. Never one to mince words (even when those words are directed toward those who outrank her), this old, grizzled hadozee has light-tan skin and ebon-black fur graying at the temples. She's perpetually shrouded in a thick haze of cigar smoke, the smell of which often signals her imminent arrival.
>
>**Quote**: "Listen to what I tell you; it might just save your life."
>

## Part 2: Academy Orientation
Spelljammer Academy's newest cadets are given an extensive orientation. With an assigned list of orientation tasks at hand, the characters have a chance to visit various areas of the academy, noting which areas are off-limits to stripling cadets—and the dire punishments that can be meted out on those who stray into unauthorized territory.

### Debriefing
When you're ready to start, read or paraphrase the following:

>>You arrived this morning on *Belligerence*, a chartered galley out of Waterdeep, which picked up passengers and crew in the Moonshae Isles, Baldur's Gate, Candlekeep, and Port Nyanzaru. You've come to seek fortune and glory at Spelljammer Academy: a secret enclave of spellcasters and swords-for-hire on the mysterious isle of Nimbral. Graduates from the academy join the Spelljammer Fleet, a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and explore worlds far beyond.
>>
>>The academy is carved into a two-thousand-foot-high column of rock that juts up from the cliffs of the island's west coast, its multiple levels connected by stairs, ramps, and magical lifts. After docking in a sea cave at the base of the column, you marched to the Simulations Deck midway up the academy spire. Your mettle has been tested, and now it's time to settle in!
>>

Give the players a copy of handout 1, "Spelljammer Academy Map."

During the characters' debriefing, Boatswain Tarto gives each of them a pitiless assessment of their performance during the trial. As training officer, it's her job to whip new recruits into shape and show that everybody has room for improvement. Be appropriate and mindful of your players, however. A truly good leader isn't needlessly rude or cruel in their criticisms.

After the debriefing, Boatswain Tarto explains the history and mission of Spelljammer Academy (see the accompanying sidebar). Any character with spellcasting talent qualifies to join the Spelljammers, the contingent of those able to pilot a spelljamming ship. Everyone else must join the ranks of the Spelljammer Corps.

Tarto informs the cadets that they must complete several orientation tasks before the day is out (see "Orientation Tasks" below). The tasks can be completed in any order.

>Spelljammer Academy
>
>While adventurers of all stripes explore Faerûn and deal with the perils of ancient ruins, malevolent cults, and long-forgotten tombs, those who come through Spelljammer Academy on Nimbral strive to protect the world from far greater threats. Spelljammer Academy trains cadets for service as Spelljammers and members of the Spelljammer Corps: both branches of a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and to explore other worlds beyond. Few people know of the academy's existence, and its leaders try to keep it that way.
>
>Mirt the Merciless—also known as "the Old Wolf"—is Spelljammer Academy's founder and chief financial officer. He manages the institution's operations alongside a small group of powerful high-ranking officers, known collectively as "the Bridge." While most of its candidates are from Toril, the academy occasionally recruits from outside Realmspace (the Wildspace system that is home to the planet Toril) to bring individuals with unique talents into their ranks. Giff, githyanki, hadozee, plasmoids, and myriad other peoples can join the cadets alongside folk native to Toril.
>
>The academy was founded by Mirt as part of a joint investment with the retired elf adventurer Elmandar, who operates a shop on the Rock of Bral—a city built on an asteroid. Prince Andru, the monarch of Bral, has invested heavily in the academy, though his support has waned of late over questions regarding security within the institution.

#### Orientation Tasks
The characters' orientation tasks appear on handout 2 for the players:

![[003-01-007.o-orientation-tasks.webp|right|300]]

> ##### Orientation Tasks
>ALL CADETS: COLLECT WELCOME PACK FROM ADMINISTRATION
>
>ALL CADETS: REPORT TO QUARTERS FOR BUNK ASSIGNMENT
>
>ALL CADETS: REPORT TO SKY DOCK FOR SPELLJAMMING SHIP INSPECTION
>
>CORP CADETS ONLY: COLLECT SERVICE WEAPONRY FROM MISTER BLIP IN STORES
>
>SPELLJAMMER CADETS ONLY: REPORT TO SPELLJAMMER NEXUS FOR BASIC TRAINING
>
>ALL CADETS: COMPLETE GYMNASIUM ASSAULT COURSE
>

The task list also features a note regarding security, which the characters see posted throughout the academy:

![[004-01-008.o-warning.webp|right|300]]

> ##### Warning!
>Due to recent thefts, security checkpoints are in operation throughout campus. Failure to stop when challenged will result in disintegration!
>

If asked about the thefts, Tarto reveals that several navigational charts depicting Realmspace were stolen recently from the Spelljammer Nexus, the training area for Spelljammer cadets. The thefts have shaken the confidence of the academy's investors and caused them to reduce their monthly funding. Mirt is not happy!

Boatswain Tarto tells the characters to get on with their tasks, then report back to her once all those tasks are complete. Tarto remains on the Simulations Deck.

### Exploring the Academy
The characters are now free to explore the campus. See "Academy Locations" below for information on each area noted in the orientation tasks.

#### Security Levels
Spelljammer Academy has a five-tier security system. Each tier is represented by a different color, as shown below on the Security Levels table. Security levels increase from green to gold, and each higher level has access to all areas accessible to lower security levels.

Academy personnel wear uniforms in the color of their security access level. The characters are inducted as cadets (level 2) and must visit administration to collect their uniforms. To access higher security levels, academy cadets and personnel must request a security helmet: a rigid leather cap dyed in the appropriate color.

Security checkpoints are set up throughout the academy, each guarded by three **veterans**. Each guard carries a shortsword that has a green-glowing blade. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by one of these blades is instantly turned to dust, as if affected by a *disintegrate* spell. Such a sword loses its magical properties if removed from Spelljammer Academy.

Security guards refuse access to anyone not wearing the appropriate attire.

##### Security Levels
| Security Level | Rank | Locations |
|---|:---:|---|
| 1: Green | Visitor | Administration (except Record Room), Sea Dock (except Cargo area), Simulations Deck (except Officers' Mess) |
| 2: Red | Cadet | Cadet Quarters, Gymnasium, Spelljammer Nexus, Stores |
| 3: Blue | Sailor | Sea Dock (Cargo area), Sky Dock |
| 4: Purple | Officer | Administration (Record Room), Simulations Deck (Officers' Mess) |
| 5: Gold | Bridge | Bridge Quarters |

#### Academy Events
As the characters explore the academy, you can roll on the Academy Events table at any point to help you bring the campus to life.

##### Academy Events
| d8 | Event |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A halfling cadet dashes past, clearly late for training. Turning a corner, they bump into a pair of plasmoid cadets—and become partially stuck in one of them! After pulling themself out and helping the plasmoid correct their uniform, the halfling runs on, shouting an apology. |
| 2 | Two cadets face off in a game that magically projects illusory spelljamming ships above the game board. |
| 3 | A visiting giff dignitary is inspecting the campus, escorted by academy officers. When the giff loudly breaks wind, the officers politely carry on as though nobody heard it. |
| 4 | A magical voice announces: "All purple rank security officers report to the Sky Dock for docking inspection." |
| 5 | A manacled **mind flayer** passes by on a gurney pushed by fleet officers. The mind flayer wears an iron mask with bands restraining its facial tentacles. |
| 6 | Strange glowing fish swim through the air, phasing through walls as they go. Nobody appears bothered by them. |
| 7 | A magical voice announces: "Ectoplasmic breach on Spelljammer Nexus level. All personnel, be prepared for supernatural anomalies." |
| 8 | Two sailors walk past, discussing how even in spite of recent improvements, three out of ten exploratory fleet missions still result in all hands lost. |

### Academy Locations
The following descriptions are keyed to locations noted on the Spelljammer Academy map.

#### Administration
*Security Level: Green (Visitor Rank) or Above, Purple (Officer Rank) or Above for the Record Room*

Administration occupies the level above the Sea Dock. It includes a visitors' lounge with a bar, guest rooms for visiting off-world dignitaries, and the academy reception. A record room requires purple-level security to enter and contains paperwork on all academy personnel.

***Orientation Task: Welcome Pack.*** Characters can visit reception to collect their cadet-issue welcome packs from a thri-kreen named Sor'kur. Each pack includes the following gear:

- A red-level cadet uniform (plus spare), and a toiletry bag
- A 50 gp requisition voucher to spend at the academy stores
- A blue-level security helmet for visiting the Sky Dock during orientation

As the equipment is issued, staff members at reception give the new cadets a rundown on the academy's security protocols (see "Exploring the Academy" above).

>Sor'kur
>
>*Thri-kreen Receptionist*
>
>The thri-kreen receptionist Sor'kur (pronounced SOAR-ker) is always busy, and there's no one better suited for the job. Whether she's sorting mail, passing messages, asking requests for assistance via several *sending stones*, or handing out welcome packs to new recruits, her multiple arms make it all look easy. Sor'kur has white chitin mottled with patches of brilliant blue, and matching blue eyes.
>
>**Quote**: "Academy accounts payable, Sor'kur speaking, please hold."
>

#### Bridge Quarters
*Security Level: Gold (Bridge Rank) Only*

These opulent chambers are home to the Bridge—the high-ranking officers who run Spelljammer Academy. In addition to the officers' quarters, this level contains a private banqueting chamber, a library of spellbooks, and a magical communication chamber known as an oracularium. Characters visit the Bridge Quarters in part 3 of this adventure.

#### Cadet Quarters
*Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) or Above*

This area contains a dormitory for cadets and a smaller dorm for academy graduates, the Weeping Goddess tavern (a raucous bar that serves cadets), a refectory where cadets take their meals (complete with patio dining), washrooms, the academy kitchens, and the laundry.

***Orientation Task: Bunk Assignment.*** On the characters' arrival, a giff duty officer assigns a bunk to each cadet and tells them to store their gear in their footlocker. As the characters claim their bunks, one character of your choice discovers that they've been assigned an airy bunk next to a window, near the laundry. As that character walks over to drop off their gear, four cadets march toward them. One of those cadets—a confident-looking moon elf—hurls her kit bag onto the bunk before the character can get there.

>>"Change of plan, greenie. This bunk's mine now. Go tell the duty officer it wasn't to your liking, and we'll get ourselves swapped over. Tell him you've traded bunks with Veena."
>>
>>The elf points to an unkempt bunk in the noisiest section of the dorm, just outside the washrooms.
>>

Veena is testing the new cadets. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check can scare her and her friends away. Otherwise, the arrogant cadets are more than willing to use force to teach the upstart characters who's boss. Give *inspiration* to any character who overcomes the situation without resorting to violence.

Veena and the other cadets use the **bandit** stat block but carry no weapons. Instead, they make unarmed attacks (+3 to hit, 2 bludgeoning damage on a hit). Anyone reduced to 0 hit points by such attacks is knocked unconscious for 5 minutes but doesn't make death saving throws. Veena and her friends flee if they take 2 or more damage in total.

#### Gymnasium
*Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) or Above*

The Gymnasium features a magically powered arena that can be reconfigured for a variety of training exercises. For the induction of new recruits, it is set up for a standard cadet training course.

***Orientation Task: Obstacle Course.*** Each cadet must complete the obstacle course by making ability checks or saving throws to overcome the following obstacles in order:

- Make a straight dash while targeted by loud illusory explosions, requiring a successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw.
- Leap across levitating platforms over pools of electrified water, requiring a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
- Swing from ropes through a spinning wheel of maces, requiring a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.
- Climb a slippery pole and ring a gong at the top, requiring a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.

Roll initiative to determine the order of play. In each stage in the course, a character must succeed on the indicated ability check or saving throw to overcome the obstacle and move on. A character who fails remains where they are and can try again next turn. If they fail by 5 or more, they also take 2 damage of a type you choose, consistent with the test—lightning damage for the water pools, thunder damage for the explosions, and so forth.

Any character reduced to 0 hit points during the obstacle course falls unconscious and must sit out the remainder of the event. Give inspiration to any character who successfully completes the course.

#### Sea Dock
*Security Level: Green (Visitor Rank) or Above, Blue (Sailor Rank) or Above for the Cargo Area*

This expansive sea cave contains berths for oceangoing vessels, animal pens for livestock, a dry dock for ship repairs, and a blue-level restricted area for cargo storage. New recruits arriving at the Sea Dock are guided to reception on the Administration level.

#### Simulations Deck
*Security Level: Green (Visitor Rank) or Above, Purple (Officer Rank) or Above for the Officers' Mess*

The Simulations Deck features a circular main hall leading to three magical simulation chambers. Each simulation chamber is a large circular space with a domed ceiling and arcane runes carved into its stonework. Using preset command words, an officer in uniform can create a variety of simulations within any one of these chambers, filling it with an illusory scene that affects the five senses.

Boatswain Tarto is present here throughout the day as the characters attempt to complete their orientation tasks, running other cadets through a variety of training programs. Characters can report back to her after completing their orientation tasks (see "Reporting to Tarto" below).

An officer's mess on this level requires purple-level security or higher to enter. The mess is where instructors and other officers of the academy have their meals.

#### Sky Dock
*Security Level: Blue (Sailor Rank) and Above*

Spelljamming ships frequently dock at the summit of the academy. Most vessels are assigned to the Spelljammer Academy, but some are independent merchant vessels delivering supplies.

Security guards at the stairs leading to the Sky Dock challenge anyone trying to enter this area without proper authorization (see "Exploring the Academy"). The characters must be wearing the blue security helmets included in their welcome packs (see "Administration") to access this area.

***Orientation Task: Ship Inspection.*** Twin gnome officers named Kip and Pik show the characters around a spelljamming ship, teaching them the basic operations of the vessel and explaining how equipment should be handled.

***One Good Turn.*** At some point during the inspection, have each character make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Whoever rolls the highest notices a suspicious event. On a nearby dock, a hobgoblin academy officer supervising the unloading of a merchant ship surreptitiously slips the merchant a platinum piece. In return, the merchant hands the hobgoblin a small bottle, which the officer conceals in his pocket. It is up to the characters to act on this information or ignore it.

If the characters report the officer (who you can name as you wish), the hobgoblin is challenged and gives up the bottle, which holds fine Yggdrasil Garden Rum. The officer is consigned to the brig for violation of customs charges—but the characters later learn that he is beloved among the graduate sailors. A sniff of rum is the officer's off-the-books reward for each sailor who returns alive from a mission into Wildspace. In bringing the officer into disrepute, the characters have surely earned some enemies! Have the players note this outcome for future adventures.

>Kip and Pik Whistleslap
>
>*Gnome Inspectors*
>
>When nit-picking inane details, four eyes are better than two—something that Kip and Pik Whistleslap make abundantly clear. The two gnome ship inspectors wear meticulously maintained uniforms and the most-feared white gloves in the academy. Both have walnut-colored skin and carefully groomed long black hair, kept in tidy buns. Kip is well known for his no-nonsense attitude, which is complemented by his sister Pik's quick-witted jovialness. Pik has a red scar down one cheek—a stern reminder of an inspection gone wrong.
>
>- **Quirk** Kip and Pik often finish one another's sentences, a trait that others sometimes find unnerving.

![[005-01-003.o-sky-dock.webp|right|300]]

#### Spelljammer Nexus
*Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) and Above*

The Spelljammer Nexus is the exclusive training area for Spelljammer cadets. It contains a laboratory, a library of navigational and astronautical references, a chart room, and the nexus itself, which is a large chamber containing eight training *spelljamming helms*—ornate, high-backed chairs mounted onto mechanical gimbals that encircle a thirty-foot-high orrery depicting Realmspace.

Those who train here are overseen by Saerthe Abizjn, a training officer (see the accompanying sidebar). Only Spelljammer cadets are permitted entry to the nexus, though Spelljammer Corps cadets can observe their training from the viewing gallery.

![[006-01-004.o-sarthe-abizjn.webp|right|300]]

>Saerthe Abizjn (Spelljammer Training Officer)
>
>*Human Spelljammer*
>
>Despite their extravagant showboating, Saerthe Abizjn (pronounced SAIR-th ah-bih-ZEEN) remains as mysterious as the isle of Nimbral from which they hail. Although relatively inexperienced in comparison to some of the other instructors at the academy, Saerthe is an experienced spelljammer. Their eyes shimmer like pools of quicksilver, allowing them to see magical auras.
>
>Saerthe's quick wit and sharp tongue provide them with an inexhaustible supply of jabs and quips (though never mean-spirited), accompanied to great effect by their natural talent with illusory magic. Saerthe's white skin is so pale as to be almost translucent, and their blonde hair is worn in a fashionable, immaculately manicured pompadour.
>
>**Quote**: "I make talent look good."
>

***Orientation Task: Basic Training.*** Saerthe teaches Spelljammer cadets how to operate the training helms and guide the movement of miniature test ships, which move mechanically through the orrery as it spins. To complete their training, each Spelljammer cadet must use their helm to complete a Realmspace journey with their test vessel.

Issuing commands through a *spelljamming helm* is a strange sensation: more akin to thinking about moving a limb than operating controls. No ability checks are required here, but Saerthe asks each character involved in a training session one of the following questions:

- "What life event in your past drove you to live in this moment, right now?"
- "Tell me where you wish to be one year hence. What shall the cosmos make of you?"
- "Something inside your mind holds you back. What is it? Speak, or it may just poison your ability to fly."
- "Tell me honestly—who among your friends and fellow cadets do you most respect?"
- "Where did you come from? I sense a great destiny inside you, yearning for release."
- "Tell me a tale of your past. What should I know of you?"

Award each character *inspiration* once they've all answered the questions.

#### Stores
*Security Level: Red (Cadet Rank) and Above*

The academy's storerooms contain basic equipment, rations, and an extensive armory. Most academy personnel aren't allowed past the storefront, where quartermaster Mister Blip allocates supplies through a barred window.

***Orientation Task: Collect Service Weaponry.*** Upon arrival, each corps cadet is assigned a simple or martial weapon of their choice. Cadets can also spend their 50 gp requisition voucher to purchase additional equipment from any of the following sources:

- The *Armor*, *Weapons*, *Adventuring Gear*, or *Tools* tables in chapter 5 of the *Player's Handbook*
- The *Equipment Packs sidebar* in chapter 5 of the *Player's Handbook*

No change is given for purchases, so that if a character doesn't spend the full 50 gp, any gold left on their voucher is lost.

![[007-01-005.o-mister-blip.webp|right|300]]

>Mister Blip (Academy Quartermaster)
>
>*Autognome Quartermaster*
>
>Mister Blip is an odd but well-loved member of Spelljammer Academy. During a ship attack some years ago, the autognome's creator was slain and his memories were lost. With no purpose to speak of, Mister Blip wandered aimlessly, and eventually encountered Boatswain Tarto in her travels. The hadozee invited the autognome to Spelljammer Academy, and he's been there ever since.
>
>Mister Blip is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge on all subjects related to spelljamming. Chances are if you have a question, he's got a dozen different answers for it—and usually doesn't stop opining until asked to be quiet. His quarters are an absolute mess, featuring half a dozen tables piled high with tomes, curiosities, and devices of unknown purpose.
>
>Mister Blip wears a smart-looking leather apron with a score of tools of various purpose tucked into tiny leather loops. The only other article of clothing he wears is a black felt bowler cap. The color of his eyes changes depending on his mood: green if he's feeling inquisitive, blue when determined, red for angry, yellow when excited, and pink if he's proud, among others. A long, smartly crafted bronze mustache completes his ensemble.
>
>**Quote**: "If you're looking for a quick answer, I'm probably not the best place to find it."

### Reporting to Tarto
Once all orientation tasks are complete, the characters can report back to Boatswain Tarto. One character of the players' choosing must deliver a spoken report of their orientation. If they perform well, give this character inspiration.

#### The Last Task
After hearing the report, Tarto informs the group that there's one last task they must perform before they're dismissed for lunch. A spelljamming trader has delivered a fresh shipment of supplies to the academy, including a crate addressed to the academy head, Mirt the Merciless—also known as the Old Wolf.

Tarto gives each character a gold security helmet, then orders the characters to deliver the crate to Mirt's room in the Bridge Quarters. She explains that the Old Wolf was up late entertaining visiting dignitaries from the Rock of Bral and is feeling more than a little worse for wear. As such, the characters should keep the noise to a respectable level.

The characters' mission has two directives:

- Avoid damaging or tampering with the crate in any way.
- Obey Mirt's orders to the letter.

If the characters carry the crate to Mirt's room, proceed to part 3. The guards at the Bridge quarters nonchalantly wave them past as long as they're wearing the gold security helmets. Once the delivery has been made, the characters can retire for lunch.

***Shipping Crate.*** The wooden shipping crate is about two feet on a side and bears a large label that reads "For Mirt." It weighs roughly 100 pounds. One strong character can carry it awkwardly, or two characters can carry it easily.

Unknown to anyone at the academy, the crate secretly contains a number of hungry **neogi hatchlings**. If the characters open the crate or otherwise find a way to divine its contents before visiting Mirt's quarters, you'll need to refer to part 3 for guidance. At your determination, the hatchlings can also gnaw their way out of the crate at any time that feels dramatically appropriate.

## Part 3: Intruder Alert!
While fulfilling the orders given to them by Boatswain Tarto, the characters meet Mirt the Merciless and discover that someone has sent the head of Spelljammer Academy a most deadly gift.

### Mirt's Quarters
On arrival at the door to Mirt's quarters, the characters hear loud snoring within. (Feel free to give the players your best snoring impression.) Knocking or pushing on the door reveals that it's partly ajar and causes it to creak open. Read or paraphrase the following if the characters peer inside:

>>Mirt's quarters are sumptuously decorated with velvet curtains, gold fittings, and oak panels. A cauldron-sized fishbowl stands along one wall, filled with squirming octopuses. On the opposite wall, a table bears a topographic map of the Sword Coast. Nearer the door, a walk-in wardrobe stands partly open, golden light spilling out from within.
>>
>>Peering in, you see the Old Wolf himself, sprawled over a giant, leathery bed—and snoring loudly.
>>

![[008-01-010.o-mirts-quarters.webp|right|300]]

#### Fishbowl
The fishbowl contains a number of tiny harmless octopuses. If the bowl is broken (it has AC 5, 2 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage), each creature within 5 feet of the tank is knocked prone and soaked through by the sudden outflow of water.

#### Topographic Map
Close inspection of the map on the table reveals that it is set with tiny figurines representing troops. The figurines magically animate whenever a creature moves within 5 feet of the table, playing out a mock battle between giants and dragons. Disturbing the battle is dangerous, though. Anyone who touches the table or a figurine is targeted by tiny catapults (+4 to hit; 3 bludgeoning damage on a hit). After making three such attacks, the catapults run out of ammunition.

#### Walk-In Wardrobe
This magical wardrobe ensures that Mirt always looks resplendent for his duties. Any creature that enters the wardrobe is sucked into an extradimensional space and removed from play until start of its next turn, when it emerges from the wardrobe having been treated to a full makeover, featuring fresh makeup and perfume, coiffured hair, and pressed clothes. The process is invigorating, and any creature that undertakes it while injured is restored to full hit points.

#### Waterbed
Mirt's leathery bed shifts and rocks, and close inspection reveals that it's filled with water. If the waterbed is damaged (it has AC 5, 3 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage), each creature within 5 feet of it is knocked prone and soaked through by the sudden outflow of water.

### Opening the Crate
When Mirt gets any sense of the characters' presence, he opens a single bloodshot eye and speaks:

>>"Uuuurgh... by Ilmater's buttocks, mah head is explodin'! If ye've come to drop off that thing, just put it on the rug there, open it as quietly as ye can, and let me die in peace."
>>

At that point, the characters hear a strange thump from within the crate.

If Mirt is asked about the crate, he has no idea who it's from or what's inside. He impatiently demands that the cadets open it up before he regurgitates last night's dinner, which he has no memory of eating.

When the characters open the crate, read or paraphrase the following:

>>As you open the crate's lid, a cacophony of high-pitched squeals emanates from within. Grotesque creatures scuttle into the light: ugly cat-sized monsters with hairy, spiderlike bodies and eel-like heads. Mirt yelps in shock, tumbles from his bed, and lands heavily on the floor, dragging his bedcovers with him.
>>

#### Dealing with the Hatchlings
Eight **neogi hatchlings** emerge from hiding inside the crate, positioning themselves around it before combat begins. Each round, the hatchlings attack any characters they can reach. As Tiny creatures, two hatchlings can occupy a single 5-foot space if needed.

Due to his hungover state, Mirt is unlikely to participate in this combat (see "Mirt's Rude Awakening" below). He is a high-level character and won't be at risk here, so no stats are required for him.

![[009-01-006.o-neogi-hatchlings.webp|right|300]]

#### Mirt's Rude Awakening
Even on the best of days, Mirt requires a remarkable amount of time to rise from his bed. Though energized by the imminent threat of death, it takes the Old Wolf a full 30 seconds (5 rounds) to mobilize his hungover body. Each turn on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), update the players on Mirt's situation using the relevant entry from the table below. If any hatchlings remain alive after 6 rounds, Mirt swiftly skewers them with his rapier and brings the combat to an end.

| Round | Behavior |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Mirt rolls about on the floor, trying to unravel himself from the bedcovers. |
| 2 | Mirt hops around in his underwear, trying to pull on his breeches. |
| 3 | Mirt rushes for his belt and rapier, but his breeches slip down on route and send him sprawling. |
| 4 | Breeches around his ankles, Mirt crawls on all fours for his belt and rapier. |
| 5 | Mirt pulls on his belt and breeches, with much huffing and puffing. |
| 6 | Mirt pulls his blade from its scabbard and shouts "Ha!"—then accidentally yanks his belt off in the process, causing his breeches to slip down again. |

#### Aftermath
The sound of battle in Mirt's quarters alerts the guards just as the fight is winding down. As the last hatchlings expire, the characters hear alarms sounding throughout the Bridge Quarters, followed by the thunder of booted feet as security forces converge on Mirt's room.

Mirt is furious! Who dares to try to have him killed? His day is ruined! He swears that heads will roll once he's found out who's behind this outrage. As Mirt is blowing off steam, Mister Blip appears at the door:

>>It's difficult to tell, but the autognome looks worried. His bronze mustache hangs lower than usual, and his mechanical eyes have sunken in their sockets.
>>
>>"With regret, Master Mirt, this attack was merely a diversion. While our forces were being drawn here, more burglaries were reported across the academy. Our thief has struck again!"
>>

#### Treasure
Once all the excitement has subsided, Mirt breathlessly fishes around in a nearby backpack and draws forth a pouch, from which he digs out a handful of golden ingots. He tosses an ingot (worth 50 gp) to each of the characters with slightly winded thanks, and a murmured plea for their discretion regarding his state before and during the fight.

>Mirt the Merciless (Academy Head)
>
>*Human Adventurer (Retired) and Head of Spelljammer Academy*
>
>Mirt was a loudmouthed rogue with a reputation as an adventurer and philanderer. The Old Wolf rose to serve as one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep and became a close advisor to Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep. The extensive wealth he squirreled away as a politician ultimately forced him to flee the city and seek refuge far to the south. Mirt enjoys the finer things in life but remains stout of heart and quick with a sword.

>**Quote**: "Toril is an island adrift in a sea of chaos. It must be protected at all costs... ooh, is that cake?"

### Ending the Adventure
With the news that the thief has struck again, this adventure comes to an end. Wrap up by informing the players that their characters are dismissed to their quarters. Any security helmets in their possession must be returned to the guards before the characters leave.

The characters can rest and recuperate before the next stage of their training, as the story continues in the next adventure, *Trial by Fire*.

#### Character Advancement
The characters advance to 2nd level upon completing this adventure.

# Spelljammer Academy: Trial By Fire
![[012-02-001.o-sja02-splash.webp|right|300]]

## Introduction
This adventure, designed for **three to seven 2nd-level characters**, is the second in a series of four adventures. It is set in Spelljammer Academy on the island of Nimbral, many miles off the southwest coast of the Chultan peninsula in the Forgotten Realms setting.

### Background
Tensions are running high at Spelljammer Academy on the island of Nimbral, thanks to a recent rash of thefts and an attack against the academy's founder, Mirt the Merciless. The academy's instructors have made it clear that it's business as usual for new cadets, though. The characters will be put to the test as they participate in a competitive series of illusory training exercises against another squad of cadets. The characters are to take charge of their own spelljamming ship, plying a magical simulation of Wildspace on a mission to seek out the wreckage of a ship lost in an asteroid cluster. Are they up to the challenge?

### Overview
The adventure's story takes approximately two hours to play and is spread over three parts:

Part 1: Preflight Meal. While having breakfast and preparing for their imminent training exercise, the characters meet other cadets and discuss the recent troubling events happening at the academy.

Part 2: Test of Mettle. Under the supervision of Spelljammer training officer Saerthe Abizin and Spelljammer Corps training officer Boatswain Tarto, the cadets begin a competitive training exercise. Taking on the challenge of crewing their own spelljamming ship will test their skills, bravery, and ability to function as a team.

Part 3: Sabotage! An agent of an unknown foe sabotages the simulation chamber where the training exercise takes place, causing the equipment there to explode. The characters must help tend to the wounded and might be instrumental in discovering a clue to the identity of the saboteur.

During parts 2 and 3 of the adventure, the characters' actions determine their score—and thus their success or failure—in the training exercise.

### Adventure Hooks
*Trial by Fire* follows the events of *Orientation*, the first adventure in the series. Characters who did not participate in the first adventure are assumed to have completed their orientation and are assigned to join the other characters' training team.

>

## Part 1: Preflight Meal
The adventure begins with the characters gathering in the academy's refectory to eat breakfast with other cadets and discuss recent events at the academy.

>Spelljammer Academy
>
>While adventurers of all stripes explore Faerûn and deal with the perils of ancient ruins, malevolent cults, and long-forgotten tombs, those who come through Spelljammer Academy on Nimbral strive to protect the world from far greater threats. Spelljammer Academy trains cadets for service as Spelljammers and members of the Spelljammer Corps: both branches of a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and to explore other worlds beyond. Few people know of the academy's existence, and its leaders try to keep it that way.
>
>Mirt the Merciless—also known as "the Old Wolf"—is Spelljammer Academy's founder and chief financial officer. He manages the institution's operations alongside a small group of powerful high-ranking officers, known collectively as "the Bridge." While most of its candidates are from Toril, the academy occasionally recruits from outside Realmspace (the Wildspace system that is home to the planet Toril) to bring individuals with unique talents into their ranks. Giff, githyanki, hadozee, plasmoids, and myriad other peoples can join the cadets alongside folk native to Toril.
>
>The academy was founded by Mirt as part of a joint investment with the retired elf adventurer Elmandar, who operates a shop on the Rock of Bral—a city built on an asteroid. Prince Andru, the monarch of Bral, has invested heavily in the academy, though his support has waned of late over questions regarding security within the institution.
>

### Fellowship
To begin the adventure, read or paraphrase the following:

>>Today is the day! It's the official start of your academy training. Fresh from orientation, you and your crewmates are to report to Saerthe Abizin, the Spelljammer training officer. Before you head out, though, your first stop is the academy refectory for a hearty breakfast.
>>

Found on the Cadet Quarters level, the refectory is a large communal dining hall with a patio. The room is well lit by a dozen blue-glowing orbs attached by bronze-colored rods to the ceiling. An L-shaped counter to the northwest is covered with small tools, contraptions, and alchemical tubes and containers. Behind the counter, a door bears a sign that reads "Staff Only."

#### Breakfast of Champions
When the characters arrive, a stocky giff named Petty Officer Winston Ryeback (see the accompanying sidebar) is behind the counter doing what he does best: preparing meals for the academy's hungry cadets. When the characters arrive, the refectory holds a dozen other cadets (a mixture of **acolyte**, **apprentice wizard**, and **bandits**), all lined up before the counter or seated at tables.

Each character who joins the line receives a bowl containing a smoky concoction of deep-fried meat or beans (the character's choice), held together with sticky starches. Though the galley cook has never given his signature dish a name, most cadets have resorted to calling it "gunpowder chowder."

- In addition to the characters, another group of cadets are receiving their first training assignment today. There's talk that the training officers might combine the two groups to create a competitive training exercise on the academy's Simulations Deck.
- The Simulations Deck is a magical marvel equipped with three simulation chambers that magically create the experience of traveling and fighting in Wildspace.
- Spelljammer Academy has been plagued by a rash of recent thefts, many of them targeting instructors. The thieves have yet to be identified or caught.
- In addition to Realmspace charts going missing, one of the thefts saw Ryeback's quarters robbed of a custom pistol. The giff loudly voices his frustration around that event if any characters talk about the thefts within earshot of him.
- More troubling than the thefts is the recent attack on academy founder Mirt the Merciless (which the characters thwarted in the previous adventure). Other cadets suspect the characters' involvement but don't know the details.

>Petty Officer Winston Ryeback
>
>*Giff Galley Cook*
>
>Petty Officer Ryeback (RIE-bak) is a muscular giff in charge of the food served at the Academy (and on the rare occasion, he crews a ship). Like anyone else who runs a respectable galley, he's a staunch believer in the four basic food groups: beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard. He's raucous and brash and gives bear hugs so good you think he might break a rib (but in a good way). His gray skin is usually coated with light sheen of sweat; kitchens are hot!

>**Quote**: "The best way to someone's heart is through their stomach."

#### Meeting Miken
By the time the characters have picked up their meals, the only table with enough space for all of them is occupied by a cadet named Miken Haverstance (see the accompanying sidebar). Though his head is buried deep in a book, he notices the characters and invites them to sit if they don't do so themselves.

If the characters strike up a conversation with Miken, he expresses anxiety about the upcoming training exercises, having already convinced himself that he doesn't have what it takes to be a recruit. But he's even more afraid of letting down his fellow crewmates. He has been avoiding them to help him keep his focus.

Miken's worst enemy is his own fear. The characters can boost his confidence and lift his spirits in one of the following ways (which might affect their crew's final score at the end of the adventure):

- **Words of Encouragement** A character offering Miken advice to boost his confidence can make a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If successful, his spirits are lifted, and you can jump to part 2 of the adventure.
- **Problem Solving** A character asking Miken about his studies kicks off a conversation about spelljamming, taking his mind off his troubles. If that character succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check, Miken's spirits are lifted, and you can jump to part 2 of the adventure.
- **Feeling the Vibe** A character who speaks to Miken's crewmates can encourage them to reveal their own insecurities regarding the upcoming training exercises to put Miken's mind at ease. A successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check persuades the cadets to call Miken over to their table, bolstering his spirits, and you can jump to part 2 of the adventure.

>
>Miken (MICK-unn) constantly worries about whether he has the right skills to graduate from the Academy. When his nose isn't buried in a technical manual, he's scribbling mathematical and arcane equations in a battered pocket notebook he always keeps on him. Miken has light-olive skin, dark-brown eyes, and short, disheveled black hair framing a round face. He wears the same uniform as the other cadets.
>
>**Quote**: "I'd like to be a great spelljammer, but I don't know if I've got it in me."
>

## Part 2: Test of Mettle
After breakfast, the characters travel to the main hall of Spelljammer Academy's Simulations Deck, where they're briefed on the upcoming training exercise before they're led into one of the adjoining simulation chambers. The exercise will take them on a virtual journey through Wildspace and pit them in a race against the clock, as they must outperform a competing band of cadets facing their own simulation.

Awaiting the characters in the main hall are two officers: Saerthe Abizin (a human), the Spelljammer training officer, and Boatswain Tarto (a hadozee), the Spelljammer Corps training officer. Characters who played through the first *Spelljammer Academy* adventure met both officers; use the information in the accompanying sidebars to bring new player characters up to speed.

### Mission Briefing
The characters arrive with another squad of six cadets, including Miken Haverstance. Read or paraphrase the following:

>>You arrive at the Simulations Deck at the same time as another team of cadets, all of you gathering in the main hall where today's training officers—Saerthe Abizin and Boatswain Tarto—stand waiting. A few members of the other squad murmur excitedly, but a glare from Boatswain Tarto as she chews her cigar quiets them.
>>
>>Saerthe Abizin scans the congregation with silver eyes. Their stern gaze shifts to a wide grin. "Well, this is going to be fun."
>>

Tarto steps forward to welcome the cadets and provide the details of the upcoming training exercise. In addition to testing each cadet's skills and talents, the exercise is also a friendly competition between the two teams of cadets, with each squad earning points that are tracked and recorded by the observing officers.

![[015-02-004.o-boatswain-tarto.webp|right|300]]

>Boatswain Tarto (Spelljammer Corps Training Officer)
>
>*Hadozee Seasoned Boatswain*
>
>The scars that Boatswain Tarto (pronounced BOE-sun TAR-toe) bears are testament to her status as a battle-hardened veteran. Despite having one of her wing flaps torn away long ago, she remains as capable as ever while on board a ship. Spelljammer Academy has no better person to spearhead the training of raw recruits—and Tarto knows it. Never one to mince words (even when those words are directed toward those who outrank her), this old, grizzled hadozee has light-tan skin and ebon-black fur graying at the temples. She's perpetually shrouded in a thick haze of cigar smoke, the smell of which often signals her imminent arrival.
>
>**Quote**: "Listen to what I tell you; it might just save your life."
>

#### Assigning Roles
Saerthe explains that each team of cadets must assign crew roles to its members. This training exercise has two optional roles (Captain and Shipmate) and one mandatory role (Spelljammer). A team can have multiple Shipmates, but only one Captain and only one Spelljammer.

Try to limit the players' discussion of role assignments to a maximum of 10 minutes. Use the recommendations in the "Know Your Role" sidebar to guide them.

The roles for the training exercise are as follows:

- **Captain (Optional)** A team member who assumes this role is expected to give orders to other crew members (who, in turn, are expected to follow those orders).
- **Shipmate (Optional)** A team member in this role operates the training ship's rigging and shipboard weapons. The ship's Captain can switch to this role as necessary.
- **Spelljammer (Mandatory)** A team member in this role pilots the training ship using its spelljamming helm. One must be a spellcaster to fill this role.

>Know Your Role
>
>When choosing role assignments, keeping the following in mind can help characters form an effective spelljamming crew:
>
>- Using a *spelljamming helm* requires a keen mind, focus, and magical talent. A character with the ability to cast spells is essential for the Spelljammer role.
>- A crew relies on their captain to be intuitive, sensible, fair-minded, and decisive, making the Captain role a good fit for someone with a high Wisdom or Charisma score.

#### The Assignment
After roles are assigned, Saerthe provides the characters with the main objective of the exercise.

>>After a long pull on her cigar, Boatswain Tarto surveys the assembled crews.
>>
>>"Each crew is to navigate their ship through a debris field on the outskirts of Coliar, a sodding big gas giant. There, you're to salvage the captain's logbook from the wreckage of an abandoned ship, then return to your starting point with your own ship intact."
>>
>>Tarto levels a steely eye and says with a glare, "Intact, not first. Get the mission done well; not quick."
>>

If the characters were friendly with Miken in part 1, he wishes them good luck. Both teams then head toward the simulation chambers where their training will take place.

For guidance on scoring the mission, see appendix A.

>Saerthe Abizjn (Spelljammer Training Officer)
>
>*Human Spelljammer*
>
>Despite their extravagant showboating, Saerthe Abizjn (pronounced SAIR-th ah-bih-ZEEN) remains as mysterious as the isle of Nimbral from which they hail. Although relatively inexperienced in comparison to some of the other instructors at the academy, Saerthe is an experienced spelljammer. Their eyes shimmer like pools of quicksilver, allowing them to see magical auras.
>
>Saerthe's quick wit and sharp tongue provide them with an inexhaustible supply of jabs and quips (though never mean-spirited), accompanied to great effect by their natural talent with illusory magic. Saerthe's white skin is so pale as to be almost translucent, and their blonde hair is worn in a fashionable, immaculately manicured pompadour.
>
>**Quote**: "I make talent look good."
>

### Simulation Chambers
Each simulation chamber is a broad circular space with a domed ceiling, its stone walls carved with arcane runes that fill the area with bright light. Each chamber is equipped with a training version of a *spelljamming helm* and creates complex illusions designed to test cadets' speed, skill, and ability to work together in a crisis.

Saerthe Abizin accompanies the characters to a simulation chamber where Mister Blip, the academy's autognome quartermaster, is preparing the physical aspects of the simulation. Mister Blip hurries over when he sees the characters enter, his eyes shifting to a green color as he greets the cadets. The autognome introduces himself to any characters who didn't meet him in the previous *Spelljammer Academy* adventure. Mister Blip's eyes shift to a bright blue as he hurries over to a table set with magical gear and mysterious devices unrecognizable to the characters, reporting that everything is ready to go.

#### Starting the Simulation
Mister Blip hands the characters two pages of parchment: a Wildspace map that shows the route to their destination, and a crude sketch of the logbook they're supposed to retrieve. Saerthe then directs the characters to gather around the training helm atop the platform. Once the characters are in position, read or paraphrase the following:

>>Saerthe steps back from the platform, holds their palms outward, and begins an incantation. The sigils scrawled along the walls and floors glow brightly, intensifying as the training officer weaves their powerful illusion.
>>
>>"Good luck, cadets," Saerthe says, "and don't be afraid. Though these illusions are realistic, thanks to my arcane prowess, they are just that—illusions."
>>
>>Blue-white lines form around you, etching the shape of a ship deck around the platform upon which you stand. The room then melts away amid an explosion of colors, textures, and sounds that place you on the deck of a ship that is shaped like a gigantic hammerhead shark. The ship is situated in the Sky Dock atop Spelljammer Academy. Scudding clouds fill the sky above you.
>>

#### Simulator Rules
Each simulation chamber channels powerful illusion magic that adheres to the following rules:

- **Just Like the Real Thing** The simulation around the characters affects all their senses. Everything looks, feels, and sounds real, with the illusion able to create the sense that the characters are in areas whose dimensions are larger than the room. Everything that happens within the illusion should be treated as if the characters are truly where they appear to be.
- **Illusory Wards** Characters can't sense that they are in an illusion, nor can the illusion be dispelled. The *detect magic* and *dispel magic* spells don't register or disrupt the magic of the illusion, nor of the creatures or objects it creates.
- **Damage** Any character who is reduced to 0 hit points by the simulation falls unconscious but isn't dying. The character remains unconscious until the simulation ends, at which point the character awakens and gains 1 level of exhaustion from lingering psychic shock.
- **Restored Resources** When the simulation ends, characters regain all their lost hit points, spell slots, and limited-use powers.

#### Taking Off
Once the illusion begins, the crew must take off and ascend into Wildspace. This requires the character in the Spelljammer role to succeed on a DC 13 ability check using their spellcasting ability. If the check succeeds, the character uses the *spelljamming helm* to propel the ship skyward. If the character succeeds on the check on the first try, it counts toward the group's score in the training exercise (see appendix A). A second attempt at the check succeeds automatically.

>>The island of Nimbral disappears quickly beneath your ship, which passes through clouds until the spectacular void of Wildspace comes into view.
>>

>Mister Blip (Academy Quartermaster)
>
>*Autognome Quartermaster*
>
>Mister Blip is an odd but well-loved member of Spelljammer Academy. During a ship attack some years ago, the autognome's creator was slain and his memories were lost. With no purpose to speak of, Mister Blip wandered aimlessly, and eventually encountered Boatswain Tarto in her travels. The hadozee invited the autognome to Spelljammer Academy, and he's been there ever since.
>
>Mister Blip is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge on all subjects related to spelljamming. Chances are if you have a question, he's got a dozen different answers for it—and usually doesn't stop opining until asked to be quiet. His quarters are an absolute mess, featuring half a dozen tables piled high with tomes, curiosities, and devices of unknown purpose.
>
>Mister Blip wears a smart-looking leather apron with a score of tools of various purpose tucked into tiny leather loops. The only other article of clothing he wears is a black felt bowler cap. The color of his eyes changes depending on his mood: green if he's feeling inquisitive, blue when determined, red for angry, yellow when excited, and pink if he's proud, among others. A long, smartly crafted bronze mustache completes his ensemble.
>
>**Quote**: "If you're looking for a quick answer, I'm probably not the best place to find it."

### Journey through Wildspace
During their simulated journey, the characters must overcome the challenges described below. A challenge is resolved by having each character make an ability check. If half or more of the characters succeed on the check, the challenge is overcome. Otherwise, the characters fail their initial attempt, and their score is impacted (see appendix A), but any follow-up attempt succeeds automatically, allowing the training exercise (and the journey) to continue.

> ##### Challenge 1: Plotting a Course
>The characters must use their Wildspace map to plot a course to their destination. Have each character make a DC 12 ability check. Each player chooses which check to make based on their character's role aboard the ship:
>
>**Captain**: Wisdom (Survival) or Charisma (Persuasion)
>
>**Shipmate**: Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
>
>**Spelljammer**: Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival)
>

> ##### Challenge 2: Electrical Storm
>The characters' ship accelerates to spelljamming speed, racing through Wildspace toward its destination. After a minute or so in this simulated state, the ship returns to its normal flying speed. A school of giant space eels swims past the ship, and each eel discharges a bolt of lightning as it zips by. The ship is caught in the eels' electrical storm, which starts one or more fires on the deck.
>
>Avoiding the worst of the electrical storm and extinguishing the flames requires each character to make a DC 13 ability check. Each player chooses which check to make based on their character's role aboard the ship:
>
>**Captain**: Wisdom (Survival) or Charisma (Persuasion)
>
>**Shipmate**: Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
>
>**Spelljammer**: Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Survival)
>

> ##### Challenge 3: Asteroid Cluster
>Once the space eels are a safe distance away, the ship can resume its journey, traveling rapidly at spelljamming speed. After another minute in this simulated state, the ship arrives at its destination, where the characters discover that the abandoned ship they seek is located at the center of a cluster of asteroids. Reaching the ship safely means navigating a careful route through the asteroids.
>
>Have each character make a DC 13 ability check. Each player chooses which check to make based on their character's role aboard the ship:

>
>**Shipmate**: Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
>
>**Spelljammer**: Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Perception)
>
>If the characters fail their initial attempt to avoid the asteroids, the ship is lightly damaged as it grazes an asteroid. This damage becomes relevant later (see "Wildspace Battle" below).

### Salvage Operation
Once their ship passes through the asteroid cluster, the characters reach the wreckage of a flying fish ship, torn apart by the celestial debris. The longer the characters take to locate and claim the captain's logbook, the more difficult the task becomes. Initiative rolls aren't necessary but track how many rounds of ability checks it takes for the characters to spot the derelict ship's logbook.

#### Spotting the Logbook
The wreckage is surrounded by a cloud of silvery dust particles that reduce visibility. After pulling alongside the wreck, characters searching for the logbook must make a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check, spotting it if successful. The logbook lays amid debris from the captain's cabin, all of which bobs in the derelict's gravity plane. The characters repeat this check each round until the logbook is spotted.

#### Retrieving the Logbook
The next, more difficult task is obtaining the book. While the debris rests in the ship's gravity plane, it's not exactly solid ground, and disturbing it could make finding the log difficult. This is a great opportunity for the players' ingenuity and creativity to shine. Let them come up with their own way of solving the problem, whether it's using *mage hand*, tying a rope around a character's waist and leaping out toward the logbook, or other similar efforts—assigning a DC 13 check using an ability and skill that you deem appropriate. If successful, they are able to retrieve the logbook.

#### Leaving the Asteroid Cluster
Once the logbook is safely on board, the characters can exit the asteroid cluster. Once again, the characters must avoid the asteroids by repeating challenge 3 from the "Journey through Wildspace" section; if the ship was lightly damaged by an asteroid earlier and grazes another asteroid on its way out of the cluster, the ship becomes heavily damaged instead.

### Wildspace Battle
![[018-02-007.o-swashbuckling-splash.webp|right|300]]

>>As your ship steers clear of the asteroids, another ship appears. Its sleek frame is painted in a wild shade of pink and is designed to resemble an immense squid. Starlight reflects off the ship's hull—illuminating two turret-mounted ballistas rotating slowly to face your ship.
>>

The attacking ship is an old, but reliable, squid ship crewed by githyanki pirates. Having already set their sights on salvaging the derelict, the githyanki don't take kindly to the characters jumping their claim. The githyanki ship immediately moves into attack position, forcing the characters into battle.

#### Hammerhead Ship
The following statistics are for the characters' training ship and appear in handout 1. The ship is equipped with one ballista and two mangonels, each on a rotating mount. The front of the ship also acts as a devastating ram. Provide the players with that handout for easy reference.

##### Hammerhead Ship Summary
|  |  |
|---|---|
| Armor Class 15 (wood) | Cargo: 30 tons |
| Hit Points: 400 | Crew: 15 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 250 ft./25 ft. |
| Speed: Fly 35 ft. (4 mph) | Cost: 40,000 gp |

- **Hit Points** If the ship was lightly damaged in the "Journey through Wildspace" section, it has 300 hit points instead. If the ship was heavily damaged in the "Salvage Operation" section, it has 220 hit points instead.

#### Squid Ship
The following statistics are for the attacking githyanki pirate ship and appear in appendix B. The ship is equipped with two ballista and a mangonel, each on a rotating mount. The tentacles at the ship's bow also act as a piercing ram.

##### Squid Ship Summary
|  |  |
|---|---|
| Armor Class 15 (wood) | Cargo: 20 tons |
| Hit Points: 300 | Crew: 13 |
| Damage Threshold: 15 | Keel/Beam: 250 ft./25 ft. |
| Speed: Fly 30 ft. (3½ mph) | Cost: 25,000 gp |

#### Using Roles in Combat
During each round of combat, a ship has its own turn and the members of its crew resolve its actions. Actions available to each crew member are dependent upon their assigned roles.

### Running the Encounter
Use the following guidance for running and resolving the encounter between the characters' hammerhead and the githyanki ship.

#### The Battle Begins
Using the side initiative variant rules from *chapter 9* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, the players roll a d20 for their initiative as a group, and you roll a d20 for the githyanki aboard the enemy ship. Neither roll takes any modifiers.

The githyanki ship is 50 feet away from the hammerhead ship and maintains its distance throughout this encounter, attempting to disable the characters' ship before the githyanki attempt to board it. While the hammerhead ship is faster than the githyanki ship, the characters will still be in range of its weapons if they choose to flee.

#### Evil Shadows
Two **shadows**—former crew members of the flying fish ship that lie strewn amid the asteroids—are attracted to the battle as it unfolds. At the start of the fourth round of combat, they appear at the stern of the characters' ship and attack the nearest creatures. Roll a d20 for the shadows' initiative, again with no modifier.

#### Alternative Scenarios
Some characters might want to resort to options other than direct ship-to-ship combat when the githyanki ship attacks, with a few examples discussed below. Use your best judgment when adjudicating these tactics, and reward players for great ideas and quick thinking.

***Using Magic.*** Certain spells can be used to damage an enemy ship or hamper its crew. A ship's spelljamming helm or pilot often can't be targeted without being aboard the enemy ship.

***Boarding.*** The characters can board the ship instead of fighting it at a distance. Any such attempt requires the pilot to move the character's ship within 5 feet of the enemy ship.

Once one or more characters board the githyanki ship, that ship makes only one ballista attack each round. The rest of the crew—six githyanki pirates using the **bandit** stat block, but which are resistant to psychic damage—leave their stations to defend the ship, taking the characters on in combat. See appendix C for the squid ship's layout.

### Ending the Encounter
The encounter ends when one of the following conditions is met:

- The enemy ship is reduced to 100 hit points or fewer, causing it to retreat.
- The enemy ship takes two critical hits, causing it to retreat.
- The characters' ship moves more than 100 feet away from the enemy ship, at which point the enemy ship breaks off its pursuit and flees.
- The characters' ship is reduced to 0 hit points. If this occurs, the characters fail the training exercise, and the simulation ends.

### Help!
Provided the characters don't lose their ship in the training exercise, they can make their return journey once their ship-to-ship battle ends:

>>Your ship slows, marking the unexpected presence of something else in the vicinity. It takes just a moment to spot another hammerhead ship in the distance. The other ship is severely damaged and adrift. Every few seconds, bands of electricity ripple out from the center of its hull, dealing further damage to the ship.
>>

If the characters approach the other hammerhead ship, they spot the cadets from the other team on its deck. No check is needed to tell they're in trouble. Miken is among them and waves for help.

The characters can choose to leave the other team to their fate with the goal of beating them to the finish line, or they can approach the other ship and evacuate its crew before that ship is destroyed.

After the characters abandon or evacuate their fellow cadets, the simulation ends. Continue with part 3.

## Part 3: Sabotage!
The simulation chambers at Spelljammer Academy have been sabotaged, causing Saerthe's illusions to erupt with a backlash of energy. This backlash caused the *spelljamming helm* aboard Miken's simulated hammerhead ship to malfunction at the end of part 2.

The characters won't learn the full story in this adventure, but the sabotage is related to the recent rash of thefts at the academy and the attack on Mirt. The saboteurs' targets are the academy's instructors—but cadets are prone to get caught in the crossfire.

### Shattering Illusions
Read or paraphrase the following to start this final encounter:

>>The illusion around you ends in a wave of silvery blue light, and you stand within the simulation chamber where your training exercise began. Magical energy ripples like a turbulent cloud around you, reaching out to touch the rune-scribed walls, then exploding outward as bolts of lightning, sending Saerthe, Tarto, and others flying to the ground.
>>

Each character must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Picking Up the Pieces
Most of the magical backlash caused by the sabotage was directed at Saerthe Abizin and Boatswain Tarto, where the two were supervising the training exercises. Both are badly injured.

In addition to tending to their own wounds, the characters can head to the other simulation chamber where Miken's group of cadets was being tested. If the characters spoke with and encouraged Miken in part 1, or if they inspired Miken's fellow cadets to open up to them, they discover that Miken's actions saved his fellow teammates from the worst of the magical backlash. If the characters were unsuccessful in their overtures or made no effort to interact with Miken or his fellow cadets, two of those cadets are critically wounded. Unless they receive magical healing, they die in three rounds. Alternatively, a character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check is able to stabilize them—provided they do so within three rounds.

#### Finding Clues
Characters can help the training officers examine the simulation chambers for signs of sabotage. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check notices an odd-shaped metallic plate crudely jammed into the walls of one of the chambers. A search of the other chamber reveals an identical object, with each bearing a jagged sigil carved into it. A *detect magic* spell reveals powerful magic emanating from both objects. (If the characters don't find either plate, Mister Blip discovers one of them.)

Once Saerthe Abizin or Boatswain Tarto are informed, they examine the plate and deduce it to be the cause of the sabotage. In addition, examination of the sigil reveals something to the officers, which the characters can overhear:

>>Boatswain Tarto scowls, chomping down on her cigar. She points to the sigil as she looks to Saerthe Abizin.
>>
>>"That look familiar to you?"
>>
>>Saerthe's quicksilver eyes scan the object coldly. "Vocath. I should have suspected. It appears that the mercane's grudge against Mirt has become a vendetta. The Old Wolf must be told."
>>

If any characters ask about Vocath, both officers crisply inform them that the matter is none of their business. (The characters will have a chance to learn more in subsequent adventures.)

### Ending the Adventure
Although the training exercises were sabotaged, all the cadets completed enough of the session to receive their scores. The characters earn points in the training exercise as outlined in appendix A.

If the characters earn 6 points or more, they successfully complete the exercise. For winning the competition against the other squad, each character is awarded 100 gp.

If the characters earn fewer than 6 points, they fail the training exercise. Boatswain Tarto commends them for their efforts regardless (especially if they stopped to help the other squad even in their failed effort) and tells them they'll have a chance to repeat the exercise. (Unknown to the characters, though, the urgent mission presented in the next adventure will take priority.)

#### Character Advancement
The characters advance to 3rd level upon completing this adventure.

## Handout 1: Hammerhead Ship
Hammerhead ships are popular craft, especially among pirates and merchants carrying heavy cargo. They can float on water and sail across it, but they aren't built to land on the ground (their keels would cause them to tip to one side). Standard weapons on a hammerhead ship include fore and aft mangonels, a ballista, and a reinforced bow for ramming.

![[024-02-001.sja03-splash.webp|right|300]]

## Introduction
This adventure, designed for **three to seven 3rd-level characters**, is the third in a series of four adventures. The adventure begins at Spelljammer Academy, which is located on the planet Toril (the world of the Forgotten Realms setting). From there, the characters enter Wildspace and travel to the distant planet H'Catha (the outermost world in the Wildspace system known as Realmspace) to retrieve an adamantine meteorite.

>

### Background
As basic training at Spelljammer Academy comes to its conclusion, the characters are required to complete their first mission aboard a spelljamming ship. As luck would have it, orders have come down for them to embark on a retrieval mission. While confidence in the cadets' abilities is high, the recent discovery of a spy in their midst has the academy's faculty on high alert. For this reason, a staff member is coming along to supervise and make sure nothing prevents the character-recruits from completing their mission. That staff member is Petty Officer Winston Ryeback. The spy is a recruit named Miken Haverstance, who waits until the opportune moment in the adventure to strike. Until that time, he acts no differently than any other young recruit.

### Overview
This adventure takes approximately two hours to play and is split into three parts:

Part 1: Tyrant Trap! The recruits are taken to a tyrant ship that has been divested of its original complement of beholders. Once aboard, the recruits must install a *spelljamming helm* on the tyrant ship's Command Deck, where a nefarious trap awaits them.

Part 2: Like Clockwork! The recruits begin their trek across Wildspace, only to discover that their new ship has stowaways. A fight erupts between the recruits and some clockwork horrors hiding under some wreckage.

Part 3: Fire in the Galley! The recruits must save the ship from a fire on the tyrant ship's Cargo Deck. Magma mephits hint at the presence of a potential saboteur, though further investigation may turn up conflicting evidence.

### Adventure Hooks
*Spelljammer Academy: Realmspace Sortie*! follows directly after the events of *Spelljammer Academy: Trial by Fire*. In this adventure, the characters are given their first assignment: retrieving a meteorite of precious adamantine from H'Catha, a distant, disc-shaped world. The characters, having undergone training exercises, have been charged with commandeering a vacant tyrant ship for their first real mission. Others are either fresh recruits or freelancers hired by the faculty.

![[025-02-002.tyrant-splash.webp|right|300]]

## Part 1: Tyrant Trap!
The characters are roused from their slumber and given a mission: travel to the planet H'Catha and retrieve a meteor comprised of adamantine.

>Spelljammer Academy
>
>While adventurers of all stripes explore Faerûn and deal with the perils of ancient ruins, malevolent cults, and long-forgotten tombs, those who come through Spelljammer Academy on Nimbral strive to protect the world from far greater threats. Spelljammer Academy trains cadets for service as Spelljammers and members of the Spelljammer Corps: both branches of a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and to explore other worlds beyond. Few people know of the academy's existence, and its leaders try to keep it that way.
>
>Mirt the Merciless—also known as "the Old Wolf"—is Spelljammer Academy's founder and chief financial officer. He manages the institution's operations alongside a small group of powerful high-ranking officers, known collectively as "the Bridge." While most of its candidates are from Toril, the academy occasionally recruits from outside Realmspace (the Wildspace system that is home to the planet Toril) to bring individuals with unique talents into their ranks. Giff, githyanki, hadozee, plasmoids, and myriad other peoples can join the cadets alongside folk native to Toril.
>
>The academy was founded by Mirt as part of a joint investment with the retired elf adventurer Elmandar, who operates a shop on the Rock of Bral—a city built on an asteroid. Prince Andru, the monarch of Bral, has invested heavily in the academy, though his support has waned of late over questions regarding security within the institution.
>

### Get Moving, People!
Read or paraphrase the following to begin the adventure:

>>The day began early at four bells as you were awakened by Boatswain Tarto in a most discourteous fashion. Dodging thrown garbage cans, you geared up, ate a hasty breakfast, and were immediately commanded to the deck of a hammerhead ship called the *Flighty Foundling*. As soon as you board the ship, it rises into the air toward Wildspace.
>>
>>"An adamantine meteor has struck the Spire on H'Catha," says Tarto, "and you lot are going to recover it. The bad news is that H'Catha is populated solely by beholders and their kin. The good news is that an empty tyrant ship drifts above Toril, waiting for you to crew it, though you'll need to install a *spelljamming helm* on the Command Deck to make the ship fly. Traveling aboard this beholder vessel, you should be able to reach the Spire without attracting the unwanted attention of other tyrant ships patrolling H'cathan space.
>>
>>"We'll drop you off with Petty Officer Winston Ryeback, who will ensure you don't go hungry. He'll command the deck hands Miken Haverstance, Krik'Lit, and Pffred. You'll need to identify who among you is in command of the mission, as well as who commands the ship. A word of warning: the tyrant ship is made of stone, so don't try and land it in water. You'll sink like a rock."
>>
>>The *Flighty Foundling* docks alongside the tyrant ship, which looks like a gigantic, stone-carved beholder floating in orbit above Toril. You're dropped unceremoniously into the tyrant ship's Cargo Deck, along with a crate of supplies, an navigational map, and a shiny new *spelljammer helm*. Petty Officer Ryeback pulls up the rear wearing a backpack laden with cooking implements. Pots clang and clatter as he turns and waves goodbye to the *Flighty Foundling*, which has already set a course back to the academy.
>>

### Tyrant Ship Features
The tyrant ship has the following features:

- **Dimensions and Terrain** Unless otherwise noted, the ceilings in the chambers within this vessel are 20 feet high. Since the entire ship was constructed using disintegration rays, the surfaces of the floors, walls, and ceilings are smooth and featureless. Climbing a vertical surfaces is difficult without climbing gear or magic, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.
- **Lighting** The only light is what the characters bring with them.
- **Gravity Plane** The gravity plane for the tyrant ship runs midway through its roughly spherical mass. This means that where you're standing in any given room can change depending on which deck you happen to be on. For example, the floor of the Hollow Deck is the bowl-shaped surface nearest the Command Deck.

### Tyrant Ship Map
More information regarding the tyrant ship can be found on the map below. Additionally, a second map of the ship is provided as player handout 1, with tips for navigating its interior and situating the *spelljamming helm*.

![[026-02-011.tyrant-ship-without-notes.webp|right|300]]

### NPC Information
Petty Officer Winston Ryeback takes command of Miken, Krik'Lit, and Pffred and puts them to work unpacking gear (see "Equipment List" below), taking inventory, and setting up a makeshift galley in one of the Cargo Deck's chambers.

Petty Officer Ryeback keeps a weather eye on the characters and serves mostly in an advisory role throughout the mission. Feel free to use him as a means of providing hints and guidance. If the characters get over their heads in a fight, Petty Officer Ryeback can back them up at range, using his musket. He uses the **giff** stat block (see "Creature Statistics" later in the adventure), though his Longsword attacks are made with a giant cleaver that deals the same amount of damage.

>*Giff Galley Cook*
>
>Petty Officer Ryeback (RIE-bak) is a muscular **giff** in charge of the food served at the Academy (and on the rare occasion, he crews a ship). Like anyone else who runs a respectable galley, he's a staunch believer in the four basic food groups: beans, bacon, whiskey, and lard. He's raucous and brash and gives bear hugs so good you think he might break a rib (but in a good way). His gray skin is usually coated with light sheen of sweat; kitchens are hot!

>**Quote**: "The best way to someone's heart is through their stomach."

### Equipment List
The following equipment is transferred from the *Flighty Foundling* to the tyrant ship:

- *Climber's kits* (1 per character)
- *Hammers* (1 per character)
- 100 *pitons*
- 5 100-foot lengths of hempen rope
- 2 *mess kits*
- Portable cooking surface
- 2 *barrels* of water

- 5 *flasks* of cooking oil
- 2 *chests* containing fresh foodstuffs
- *Chest* containing 150 *days rations*
- 5 lanterns with *continual flame* spells cast on them
- 1/2 cord of precut firewood
- 10 *potions of healing* (each one in a metal flask)
- *Sending stone* (Boatswain Tarto has its mate)

### Installing the Helm
Petty Officer Winston Ryeback instructs the characters to place the *spelljamming helm* on the tyrant ship's Command Deck (even though the helm can function anywhere on the ship). Getting the helm to the Command Deck will take a bit of work, given that the tyrant ship's access shafts are designed for hovering beholders.

Characters can use the climbing kits, pitons, and ropes to create an anchored rope ladder that allows them to easily traverse an access shaft. Assuming they follow this course of action, no ability checks are required to climb the shaft. It simply takes time and effort. Roll 2d4 + 2 to determine how many hours it takes. Halve the time if the characters devise a clever way to accomplish the work more quickly.

Regardless of how the characters get the *spelljamming helm* to the Command Deck, a nefarious trap awaits them upon their arrival there. This trap (described below) was left behind by the tyrant ship's beholder crew before they abandoned the vessel.

When his nose isn't buried in a technical manual, he's scribbling mathematical and arcane equations in a battered pocket notebook he always keeps on him. Miken has light-olive skin, dark-brown eyes, and short, disheveled black hair framing a round face. He wears the same uniform as the other cadets.
>
>**Quote**: "I'd like to be a great spelljammer, but I don't know if I've got it in me."
>

### Spin Cycle Trap
The first time a creature enters any of the chambers on the Command Deck, a trap activates, causing the ship to rapidly spin end over end for 1 minute. When the ship starts to spin, have each character roll initiative.

***Effect.*** On initiative count 20, each character aboard the spinning ship must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the character takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the character takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

***Countermeasures.*** Characters can contend with the trap in various ways, including the following:

- **Brace, Brace, Brace!** As an action, a character can make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to try to brace themself to keep from getting tossed about. If the check is a failure, no benefit is gained, and the action is wasted. If the check is successful, the character has advantage on their next Dexterity saving throw against the trap and takes no damage if the saving throw is successful.
- **Deactivate Trap** A character on the Command Deck can take an action to fiddle with arcane control panels embedded in the walls, pressing buttons and hoping for a good result. In this case, have the character roll a d10; on a 10, the trap deactivates. Alternatively, the character can use the action to study the controls and make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If the check is successful, the character figures out how to shut down the trap and can use their next action to do so (automatic success).
- **Magic** A character who can hover is unaffected by the trap, so long as no hard surfaces are in the character's space. A character who is under the effect of a *feather fall* spell can be knocked prone by the trap but takes no damage from it.
- **Roll with It!** As an action, a character can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to try to roll with the spinning ship while avoiding collisions with hard surfaces. If the check is a failure, no benefit is gained, and the action is wasted. If the check is successful, the character has advantage on their next Dexterity saving throw against the trap and takes no damage if the saving throw is successful.
- **NPCs on Spin Cycle** As soon as the ship starts to spin, Petty Officer Winston Ryeback activates magic tattoo on his arm that allows him to cast the *feather fall* spell once. The tattoo then vanishes. If Miken, Krik'Lit, and Pffred are still with him, the spell affects them as well. If they're not with him, assume that when the spin cycle ends, they are all unconscious but stable at 0 hit points. They can each be fed a *potion of healing* from the equipment brought on board.

>*Thri-kreen Carpenter's Apprentice*

>*Plasmoid Deckhand*
>
>You'll be hard-pressed to find a more excellent whistler than the pale-green plasmoid Pffred. His jaunty tunes can be heard on nearly every deck. Pffred is also one of the few crew members who appreciates Petty Officer Ryeback's cooking.
>
>**Quote**: "There's nothing like seeing full sails, stars in the sky, and a clean deck—especially if you have friends with you!"
>

### Wrapping Up
Once the characters have disabled or survived the spin cycle trap, they can place the *spelljamming helm* in any of the Command Deck's chambers. A spellcasting character can then attune to the helm. If no character can attune to the helm, Miken Haverstance volunteers to serve as the ship's spelljammer. Otherwise, Miken keeps quiet and sticks with Petty Officer Ryeback.

## Part 2: Like Clockwork!
This encounter begins when the characters investigate strange sounds coming from the tyrant ship's Hollow Deck. The sounds begin after the ship is well underway and millions of miles from home.

Any character on the Command Deck who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or higher hears the clank of metal on stone coming from the hatch in the middle of the floor of deck. A character who is within 5 feet of the hatch hears the sound automatically.

Any character who passes through the hatch experiences mild vertigo—the result of passing through the tyrant ship's gravity plane.

### Hollow Deck Havoc
Describe the Hollow Deck as follows:

>>This deck is one large, bowl-shaped chamber containing several large piles of mechanical parts, with many more parts strewn across the floor. Several partially disassembled autognomes are among the wreckage, and picking them apart are three insectile creatures made of gleaming metal.
>>

Three **clockwork horrors** are methodically salvaging pieces and parts from dead autognomes to construct a fourth clockwork horror, which is only half assembled. Once these creatures notice the characters, read or paraphrase the following:

>>The insectile automatons menace you with rotating saws that extend from their forelimbs. They appear to speak to each other using clicking noises that seem oddly familiar.
>>

The clockwork horrors are speaking Thri-kreen to one another, so thri-kreen characters understand what they say as they attack. The creatures mockingly praise the characters for bringing a *spelljammer helm* onto the tyrant ship, so the horrors can take command of the vessel once the characters are all dead.

### Autognome Survivor
Once the clockwork horrors have been defeated, the characters can search the wreckage scattered throughout the Hollow Deck. Any character who does so can make a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a successful check, the character finds a survivor buried under one of the debris piles: an autognome named Wizpop (see the accompanying sidebar).

![[031-02-007.wizpop.webp|right|300]]

>Wizpop
>
>*Autognome Survivor*
>
>Wizpop and six other autognomes served the beholders that crewed the tyrant ship. After the beholders abandoned the ship, the autognomes were attacked by clockwork horrors. Wizpop (whose name is etched in Gnomish on a little brass plaque bolted to their chest) suffered vocal cord damage as well as other structural damage. The autognome has 6 hit points remaining, can't speak, and makes occasional whirring, hissing, and popping noises. Wizpop stops making these strange noises and regains the ability to speak once all their hit points are restored.
>
>A character can try to repair Wizpop using spare autognome parts and tinker's tools. To find the right parts, a character must spend 10 minutes searching through debris on the Hollow Deck and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Once the parts are found, a character who is proficient with tinker's tools can use the parts and the tools to make repairs. At the end of each hour of repairs, Wizpop regains 1d6 hit points.
>
>Wizpop will dotingly follow friendly characters while trying to stay out of harm's way.
>

Lying next to Wizpop is a small iron coffer, latched but not locked, that contains five pearls (100 gp each) and a case that contains a *spell scroll* of *rope trick*.

### Wrapping Up
Once the characters have had enough fun on the Hollow Deck, proceed to Part 3 of this adventure.

![[032-02-008.clockwork-horror.webp|right|300]]

## Part 3: Fire in the Galley!
A fire has erupted on the Cargo Deck where Petty Officer Ryeback has set up his galley. Smoke from the fire spreads from the Cargo Deck to the Hollow Deck, but it doesn't cross the ship's gravity plane and can't be detected on the Command Deck or Meditation Deck.

### Fire Alarm
None of the characters should be on the Cargo Deck when this scene begins.

>>Everything has settled into relative peace and quiet. Then, without warning, Miken climbs out of the access shaft you've been using to move between decks. His hair is disheveled, and his clothes reek of smoke. He's breathing hard from his climb and appears to be having difficulty speaking between labored gasps of air.
>>

Though winded and fatigued, Miken is unharmed. When one or more characters approach him, he croaks out, "Fire... in the galley... out of control. Must... save others."

### Cargo Deck Conflagration
Miken follows the characters as they head to the Cargo Deck to combat the fire, as does Wizpop if the characters found and repaired the autognome. The characters arrive to find the Cargo Deck filled with thick smoke. Rules for the smoke are as follows:

![[033-02-009.magma-mephit.webp|right|300]]

- **Smoke Inhalation** Any creature that needs to breathe must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw whenever it starts its turn on the Cargo Deck. The saving throw is made with advantage if the creature's nose and mouth is covered with damp cloth. If the saving throw is a failure, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion.
- **Visibility** Visibility on the Cargo Deck is reduced to 10 feet. Creatures and objects beyond that range are *heavily obscured*.

#### Elemental Meddling
The chamber containing the galley is the source of the fire, which Miken set using two *spell scrolls* (*glyph of warding* cast at 4th level and *conjure minor elementals*). The *glyph of warding* was triggered when Petty Officer Ryeback activated his portable cooking surface. The fire spread with the help of four magma mephits. The giff Petty Officer managed to slay one of the mephits before succumbing to fire damage and smoke inhalation.

When the characters reach Petty Officer Ryeback's dead body, three **magma mephits** attack them. Due to their elemental nature, the mephits aren't as hindered by the smoke. They can see clearly out to 20 feet, and creatures and objects beyond that range are only *lightly obscured*.

#### Running the NPCs
As the characters defeat the last of the mephits, Krik'Lit and Pffred get the fire under control by expending half the group's water supply. Each of them has 3 levels of exhaustion from smoke inhalation.

While Krik'Lit and Pffred focus on putting out the fire, Miken passes out water-soaked cloths that everyone can wrap around their noses and mouths, giving them advantage on saving throws to resist the effect of smoke inhalation.

If Wizpop is present, the traumatized autognome watches the scene unfold but takes no actions unless it is given a direct order from a character. Smoke inhalation isn't a problem for Wizpop, who doesn't breathe.

### Aftermath
The smoke begins to clear once the fire is extinguished, allowing characters to survey the damage without having to worry about smoke inhalation. The *potions of healing* and the *sending stone* survived the fire and can be easily retrieved, as can the chest of rations.

#### Depleted Supplies
The following equipment was consumed by the fire or expended putting out the flames:

- Portable cooking surface
- 2 *barrels* of water
- 5 flasks of cooking oil
- 2 *chests* containing fresh foodstuffs
- 1/2 cord of precut firewood

#### Sifting through the Ashes
Any character who searches the Cargo Deck for clues can make a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check is a failure, the character knows only that the fire started near Petty Officer Ryeback's portable cooking surface. If the check succeeds, the character ascertains the following:

- **Cause of the Fire** Although the fire originated from Petty Officer Ryeback's portable cooking surface, the surface is incapable of producing an explosion big enough to cause such a conflagration, nor could it summon the magma mephits.
- **Magical Origin** The fire was likely started by a magic spell—perhaps a spell cast on or near Petty Officer Ryeback's portable cooking surface. The mephits were either summoned by the same spell or by another spell.

#### Questioning the NPCs
Krik'Lit and Pffred have no clue how the fire started. They remember hearing an explosion in the galley, followed by Petty Officer Ryeback screaming in pain and barking orders at them. Krik'Lit and Pffred did as they were told and opened the barrels of water while Petty Officer Ryeback battled the mephits.

Miken denies knowing who or what started the fire, but he's the only NPC cadet who has any magical talent, making him the most likely suspect. A *detect thoughts* spell or similar magic can reveal his guilt. A character can try to force a confession from Miken, doing so with a successful DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) check. If the truth comes out, Miken explains that he was recruited by a mercane to set a trap for Petty Officer Ryeback. The mercane gave Miken two *spell scrolls* to set the trap. Miken expected Petty Office Ryeback would be hurt, but not killed. Although he doesn't know the mercane's name, Miken reveals that he was promised enough money to set him and his equally young fiancé up for life. Miken surrenders to the characters at this point, throwing himself on their mercy.

### Wrapping Up
The characters have a few decisions to make:

- Do they turn back or press on?
- What do they do with Miken (assuming they know he's the traitor)?
- What do they do with the body of Petty Officer Ryeback?
- Do they use the *sending stone* to contact Boatswain Tarto with news of Miken's treachery and Petty Officer Ryeback's death?

If the characters use the *sending stone* to contact Tarto, she commands them to wait for backup. If the characters heed this command, Tarto arrives a day later aboard the *Flighty Foundling*.

The Spelljammer Academy adventure series concludes in *Behold... H'Catha*!

## Creature Statistics

## Appendix A: Realmspace
Realmspace is a system made up of eight worlds orbiting a yellow sun, as shown on the accompanying map. The distances on the map and in the Realmspace table assume the use of a ship equipped with a *spelljamming helm* (see "How Spelljamming Works" in chapter 2 of *Astral Adventurer's Guide*).

All the worlds of Realmspace have creatures and plants of one sort or another living on them. Toril is the most Earthlike, while the outer worlds (Glyth, Garden, and H'catha) are on the other end of the spectrum.

##### Realmspace
| Planet | World Type | Distance to Outer Edge of System |
|---|---|---|
| Anadia | Spherical earth body | 3,150 million miles (31½ days travel) |
| Coliar | Spherical air body | 3,100 million miles (31 day travel) |
| Toril | Spherical earth body orbited by one moon (Selune) and an asteroid cluster (Tears of Selune) | 3,000 million miles (30 days travel) |
| Karpri | Spherical water body | 2,900 million miles (29 days travel) |
| Chandos | Spherical water body | 2,800 million miles (28 days travel) |
| Glyth | Spherical, ringed earth body orbited by three moons | 2,200 million miles (22 days travel) |
| Garden | Cluster of seven earth bodies held together by a colossal plant, orbited by eleven moons | 2,000 million miles (20 days travel) |
| H'catha | Disk-shaped water body orbited by two moons | 1,600 million miles (16 days travel) |

### Locations in Realmspace
The following locations are depicted on the map of Realmspace.

![[034-02-012.realmspace.webp|right|300]]

#### Anadia
The surface of Anadia is an expanse of badlands and dry washes except at its poles, where the land flattens out into gently rolling, fertile hills dotted with forests and patches of grassland. Communities of halflings occupy the polar areas, while the barren wastes are populated by monstrous predators and scavengers.

#### Coliar
This gas giant has a multitude of earth and water islands swirling around in its turbulent winds. These islands are occupied mostly by aarakocra, lizardfolk, and dragons. The lizardfolk, in particular, are accustomed to trading with spacefaring folk.

#### Toril
Toril, the locale of the Forgotten Realms setting, is the most populous world in Realmspace and home to some of the most powerful individuals in this system. It has regular and prosperous ties with the various nations and factions of Wildspace.

Toril's single large moon, Selune, has a breathable atmosphere and is occupied by isolated groups of inhabitants. Toril's space-dwelling communities generally congregate in a cluster of asteroids that trails behind Selune in the same orbit. This cluster, called the Tears of Selune, has numerous settlements. The Rock of Bral (described in the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*) could be one of the many asteroids that form the cluster.

#### Karpri
This water world has icecaps at its poles and vegetation-choked waters in its equatorial region. In between, on either side of the equatorial zone, are bands of featureless ocean—nothing but water as far as the eye can see. Most of the planet's indigenous creatures are aquatic and dwell in the tropical sargasso, since the planet has no land masses that can support life.

#### Chandos
Chandos is a large water world with thousands of floating islands that often collide with one another, making these locations less than ideal for permanent settlements. Beneath the islands, in the depths of Chandos, live all sorts of bioluminescent aquatic creatures.

#### Glyth
Spelljamming ships known as nautiloids (described in the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*) patrol the space within 100 million miles of Glyth and hide behind the planet's three moons. This is not surprising because **mind flayers** are the undisputed masters of Glyth. The planet's air smells like it came from a charnel house, but it is not poisonous. The surface of the planet is a desolate wasteland, but beneath the crust is a labyrinth of subterranean caves inhabited by mind flayer colonies.

#### Garden
Garden is a cluster of seven planetoids inside a common air envelope, each of them linked to the others by the roots of an unimaginably large plant sometimes referred to as Yggdrasil's Child. Wildspace travelers sometimes come to Garden to restock their food, water, and air.

Garden is a refuge for spacefaring pirates, who hide their spelljamming ships in the maze of passageways that run between Yggdrasil's Child and the planetoids, and might do the same in the craters and canyons on any of Garden's eleven moons.

#### H'catha
H'catha is a disk of water floating in space, with a single large mountain called the Spindle jutting from its center. The water disk tapers at the edge to form a rim. The Spindle is 200 miles across at its base, and tapers to a peak 1,000 miles above the surface of the water. The caverns inside the Spindle are home to five warring subspecies of beholders.

# Spelljammer Academy: Behold H'Catha
![[036-03-001.sja-04-splash.webp|right|300]]

## Introduction
This adventure, designed for **three to seven 4th-level characters**, is the last in a series of four adventures. The adventure takes place in Realmspace, a Wildspace system described in the series' third installment, *Spelljammer Academy: Realmspace Sortie!*

>

### Background
Tasked with retrieving a meteorite from the planet H'Catha, the characters and their fellow Spelljammer Academy cadets boarded a derelict tyrant ship (a stone vessel built by beholders). After installing a *spelljamming helm* aboard the ship, the characters ran into some trouble.

A fire aboard the tyrant ship killed the characters' supervisor, Petty Officer Ryeback. An investigation revealed Cadet Miken Haverstance to be the saboteur. After his capture and interrogation, Miken told the characters that he'd been hired by a mercane (a blue-skinned giant), who holds a grudge against one of Spelljammer Academy's founders, Mirt the Merciless. The mercane's name is Vocath, although neither Miken nor the characters are aware of this fact.

### Overview
Despite setbacks, the characters are authorized to resume their mission to H'Catha. The skies above H'Catha are patrolled by beholder tyrant ships. The characters' goal is straightforward: slip past the planet's defenses, find the meteorite, and bring it back to Spelljammer Academy.

This adventure is split into three parts:

Part 1: The Spindle. While exploring the Spindle (a mountain that rises from the center of the disk-shaped world H'Catha), the characters encounter beholder-like creatures and might have to fight them to claim the meteorite.

Part 2: Journey Interrupted. As the characters travel back to Toril, they cross paths with an asteroid and run into a githyanki agent of Vocath looking to retrieve Miken.

Part 3: Homecoming. The characters return to the Spelljammer Academy, and soon after arrival, face a strike force sent by Vocath. Their graduation is tinged with loss, and an ominous future awaits.

### Adventure Hooks
This adventure picks up where *Spelljammer Academy: Realmspace Sortie!* leaves off. If one or more characters died in that adventure, assume their replacements are fresh cadets from the hammerhead ship *Flighty Foundling*. The characters have a rendezvous with the *Flighty Foundling* before resuming their voyage to H'Catha, as described in part 1.

## Part 1: The Spindle
In this part of the adventure, the characters arrive at the planet H'Catha and search for the adamantine meteorite at the base of a soaring mountain called the Spindle. In a cave, they encounter others who also appreciate the meteorite's value.

### Trek To H'Catha
![[037-03-002.bag-of-holdingh.webp|right|300]]

After securing the tyrant ship and capturing the cadet saboteur Miken, the characters wait for the hammerhead ship *Flighty Foundling* to double back and take Miken into custody.

Two Spelljammer Academy faculty members are aboard the *Flighty Foundling*: *Boatswain Tarto* and *Saerthe Abizin* (see the accompanying sidebars). They have decided to accompany the characters to H'Catha to ensure no further mishaps occur aboard the tyrant ship. Saerthe assumes the role of captain and spelljammer, while Tarto takes the characters under her wing and oversees the mission.

Wizpop, the autognome stowaway whom the characters encountered in the previous adventure, boards the *Flighty Foundling* and returns to Spelljammer Academy with Krik'Lit, Pffred, and the other cadets.

>>The *Flighty Foundling* returns to Toril with the other cadets and the autognome Wizpop, but your destiny lies elsewhere! You must remain aboard the tyrant ship, but you won't be traveling to H'catha by yourselves: faculty members Saerthe Abizin and Boatswain Tarto have taken command of the mission and brought more supplies with them. Tarto grimaces and gnaws on her cigar as she assigns you to dull tasks. Meanwhile, Saerthe takes control of the tyrant ship's newly installed *spelljamming helm*.
>>
>>The trek to H'Catha takes many days, and the planet's description doesn't do it justice. H'Catha is a watery disk thousands of miles wide, with a towering mountain called the Spindle at its center. Saerthe maneuvers the tyrant ship so that it hovers a few feet above the surface of the water at the Spindle's edge.
>>
>>Boatswain Tarto flicks away the stub of her smoldering cigar as she orders you to unfurl a rope ladder.
>>
>>"Here's the deal, see. You have one *sending stone*, and I have the other. When you find the meteorite, contact me and let me know, then await further instructions."
>>
>>Tarto tosses you a satchel. "This here is a *bag of holding*. You can use it to contain the meteorite. The impact site is nearby. If the meteorite isn't there, search the nearby caves. Saerthe and I will stay here and guard the ship."
>>

Keep track of who has the other *sending stone* and the *bag of holding*. Once the characters climb down the rope ladder and exit the tyrant ship, they can see their surroundings more clearly: they are standing on the rocky shore of the Spindle, a mountain bigger than any they've seen before. The sun is a distant speck, and daylight on H'Catha is no brighter than a starry night on Toril. Review the "H'Catha Features" section, then continue with the "Finding the Meteorite" section.

>Spelljammer Academy
>
>While adventurers of all stripes explore Faerûn and deal with the perils of ancient ruins, malevolent cults, and long-forgotten tombs, those who come through Spelljammer Academy on Nimbral strive to protect the world from far greater threats. Spelljammer Academy trains cadets for service as Spelljammers and members of the Spelljammer Corps: both branches of a magical navy sworn to protect Toril and to explore other worlds beyond. Few people know of the academy's existence, and its leaders try to keep it that way.
>
>Mirt the Merciless—also known as "the Old Wolf"—is Spelljammer Academy's founder and chief financial officer. He manages the institution's operations alongside a small group of powerful high-ranking officers, known collectively as "the Bridge." While most of its candidates are from Toril, the academy occasionally recruits from outside Realmspace (the Wildspace system that is home to the planet Toril) to bring individuals with unique talents into their ranks. Giff, githyanki, hadozee, plasmoids, and myriad other peoples can join the cadets alongside folk native to Toril.
>
>The academy was founded by Mirt as part of a joint investment with the retired elf adventurer Elmandar, who operates a shop on the Rock of Bral—a city built on an asteroid. Prince Andru, the monarch of Bral, has invested heavily in the academy, though his support has waned of late over questions regarding security within the institution.

### H'Catha Features
H'Catha has the following features:

- **Dimensions and Terrain** H'Catha is a disk-shaped water world with a single large mountain called the Spindle jutting from its center. The disk tapers at the edge to form a rim. The Spindle is 200 miles across at its base and tapers to a peak 1,000 miles above sea level.
- **Light** The shores of the Spindle are dimly lit. The distant sun provides little warmth or illumination.
- **Shore of the Spindle** Rocky ground worn smooth by eons of gentle waves extends about 500 feet from the water's edge to the Spindle's sheer cliffs. Standing on the shore, characters can see numerous caves in the Spindle's base.
- **Sounds** Nothing stirs in the shallow water. In the distance, sea birds call to each other, swooping and diving for food in the deeper waters.

>*Hadozee Seasoned Boatswain*

>The scars that Boatswain Tarto (pronounced BOE-sun TAR-toe) bears are testament to her status as a battle-hardened veteran. Despite having one of her wing flaps torn away long ago, she remains as capable as ever while on board a ship. Spelljammer Academy has no better person to spearhead the training of raw recruits—and Tarto knows it. Never one to mince words (even when those words are directed toward those who outrank her), this old, grizzled hadozee has light-tan skin and ebon-black fur graying at the temples. She's perpetually shrouded in a thick haze of cigar smoke, the smell of which often signals her imminent arrival.

Their eyes shimmer like pools of quicksilver, allowing them to see magical auras.
>
>Saerthe's quick wit and sharp tongue provide them with an inexhaustible supply of jabs and quips (though never mean-spirited), accompanied to great effect by their natural talent with illusory magic. Saerthe's white skin is so pale as to be almost translucent, and their blonde hair is worn in a fashionable, immaculately manicured pompadour.
>
>**Quote**: "I make talent look good."

### Finding the Meteorite
Characters who search the shore for the meteorite don't find it, but it doesn't take them long to find where the meteorite crashed:

>>In the dim light of the distant sun, you see a blemish on the face of the Spindle where something must've struck it at great speed, shattering the rock and leaving a huge indentation. Whatever struck the mountainside tumbled down toward the shore, leaving a furrow of melted rock.
>>

Characters can easily ascertain where the meteorite came to rest after tumbling down the mountainside. However, the meteorite is nowhere to be seen. Characters who search the area find a single set of tracks leading from the place where the meteorite came to rest to a 15-foot-wide, 20-foot-high cave mouth at the base of the Spindle, about 250 feet away. Any character who examines the tracks and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check identifies them as belonging to a Large Giant of some kind, possibly an **ogre**.

### Spindle Cavern
If the characters follow the tracks into the cave, read:

>>The fifteen-foot-wide passage opens into a large, rough chamber with a sunken floor. A misshapen, vaguely oblong lump of metal sits in the middle of the chamber. A sliver of light streaming down on it from a hole in the cavern's ceiling gives it a dark-blue sheen. Hovering near the meteorite are two identical creatures, each one a slimy green orb with a large central eye and four writhing eyestalks. Gathered around them are half a dozen smaller creatures of similar shape, each no bigger than a grapefruit. Sitting on a five-foot-high shelf overlooking the chamber is a massive, yellow-skinned ogre with one cyclopean eye. The ogre yawns and blinks slowly, appearing rather tired.
>>

The cavern is depicted in the Spindle Cavern map (see below). The characters arrive via the northwest tunnel, which ends at a 5-foot-high ledge overlooking the cavern.

![[040-03-009.spindle-cavern.webp|right|300]]

#### Cavern Features
The cavern has the following features:

- **Exits** The cavern has multiple exits that lead deeper into the vast network of tunnels and caves that riddle the Spindle.
- **Light** The cavern is dimly lit by the precious little sunlight streams through cracks in the ceiling.
- **Meteorite** The meteorite looks like it was dropped in the middle of the floor. The 500-pound hunk of blackened metal takes on a dark-blue sheen when its surface is illuminated. The meteorite is 2 feet long, 18 inches wide, and 18 inches tall. It can fit inside the characters' *bag of holding*.

#### Creatures
Two **spectators** and six **gazers** gather around the meteorite. The spectators can't decide which of them should guard the meteorite, and they are anxious for someone to help resolve their dispute. The gazers were drawn to the cavern by the spectators' argument but lack the intelligence to be of assistance. The cyclopean **ogre** is a simple-minded brute who found the meteorite and brought it here. The ogre serves a powerful beholder named Kurrzot who, fortunately, lives much deeper in the mountain and doesn't appear in this adventure.

It doesn't take the beholderkin long to realize that intruders have arrived. After a brief telepathic conference, the spectators use their telepathy to jointly reach out to the characters:

>>An alien voice in your head says, "Mysterious outsiders! I am Spectator Greelob. This is Spectator Orlob. Each of us claims the right to guard this strange meteorite, but only one of us may do so."
>>
>>A similar yet different telepathic voice adds, "We call upon you to mediate our dispute at once!"
>>

![[041-03-005.orlob-spectator.webp|right|300]]

By asking appropriate questions, characters can learn the following information:

- Greelob and Orlob feel compelled to guard the meteorite because it seems like a worthwhile treasure to protect. However, neither spectator tolerates the other's help. (They each want sole guardianship of the meteorite.)
- Neither Greelob nor Orlob were told to guard the meteorite.
- The cavern is the cyclopean ogre's lair. The spectators just happened by after hearing the ogre drop the meteorite on the floor. Greelob arrived first, followed by Orlob and the gazers.

The spectators want the characters to choose a guardian for the meteorite, but simply making a choice isn't enough to satisfy either spectator: the characters' proposal must include a reasonable explanation. The explanation can be as simple as, "Greelob arrived first, so Greelob should guard the meteorite." Alternatively, the characters can claim that neither spectator should guard the meteorite, since it clearly belongs to the ogre, or that the ogre should choose the guardian. Whichever characters make the proposal must then make a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If one or more characters succeed on the check, the spectators settle their dispute in the way the characters suggest. If no character succeeds on the check, the spectators refuse to accept the characters' proposal, although characters can make a different one.

If one spectator ends up guarding the meteorite, the other spectator takes the gazers and leaves via one of the other tunnels, disappearing into the mountain's depths. The ogre stays behind. If the ogre ends up as the meteorite's guardian, both spectators leave and take the gazers with them. The ogre, who is very tired, falls asleep shortly thereafter, allowing the characters to take the meteorite without any fuss.

#### Combat Erupts
The spectators won't allow the characters to claim the meteorite under their watch. If combat erupts, the spectators defend the meteorite, the gazers scatter and flee in terror, and the cyclopean ogre wearily defends itself and its lair.

### Back to the Ship
Once they've bagged the meteorite, the characters can use their *sending stone* to contact Boatswain Tarto, or they can simply head back to the tyrant ship. If they use the stone, Tarto replies as follows:

>>"Get back to the ship. This planet gives me the creeps."
>>

The characters have no encounters on their way back to the tyrant ship. Once they climb the rope ladder and get back aboard, Boatswain Tarto takes back the characters' *sending stone* as well as the *bag of holding*.

With Saerthe at the *spelljamming helm*, the tyrant ship flies away from H'Catha, slipping past other tyrant ships on patrol. Saerthe then sets a course for Toril.

Lighting a cigar, Boatswain Tarto tells the characters, "Now comes the easy part."

## Part 2: Journey Interrupted
In this part of the adventure, the characters must deal with Qitru, a githyanki working for the mercane Vocath. Qitru's mission is to retrieve Miken, the traitorous cadet. The githyanki doesn't know Miken is no longer aboard the tyrant ship, so negotiations could get interesting.

### Asteroid Ahead!
The characters' tyrant ship encounters an asteroid a few days' travel from H'Catha. Proximity to the asteroid causes the ship to reduce speed. Read the following:

>>It has been a few uneventful days, except for the revelation that Saerthe is an excellent dragonchess player. Tarto continues your training to keep your edge and stave off boredom. You've now memorized each card in the Wildspace creature silhouettes deck she brought along.
>>
>>You're gathered on the Command Deck at mealtime when Saerthe says, "Feels like an asteroid coming up on us." As the ship slows down, Saerthe remarks, "I'm sure I'm right but go get a visual to confirm." Tarto hands you back the *sending stone*. "Just in case. Now go stretch them legs."
>>

The characters need to head down to the Hollow Deck of the tyrant ship to get a good view of what's slowed them down. As they climb down the rope ladders, they pass through the tyrant ship's gravity plane before getting a good vantage point at the edge of one of the large openings on the deck. From this vantage point, they see the following:

>>A rocky debris field floats just outside your ship's air envelope. About half a mile away, a pock-marked asteroid rotates slowly. The asteroid is at least three times larger than your vessel.
>>

Attempting to hide behind the asteroid is a damselfly ship crewed by githyanki. Characters who succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check can see a brief glint suggestive of a metallic vessel moments before it disappears behind the asteroid.

If the characters send a message back to Tarto, she has a hunch that the hidden ship is a pirate vessel, since pirates are known to haunt this region of Wildspace.

### Qitru's Arrival
Read or paraphrase the following:

>>You see a strange distortion in space moments before a winged, sharklike creature appears in front of you. It has blue skin, four wings, and a hornlike protrusion on its head. An armored figure rides on its back. The rider says, "Hail to you. I've come to retrieve something that is of interest to my employer. Please produce the human named Miken Haverstance, and all will be well."
>>

Qitru, a **githyanki warrior**, rides a **star lancer**. The star lancer used Invisibility Cloak to approach the tyrant ship unseen.

Qitru is the first officer aboard the damselfly ship lurking behind the asteroid. The damselfly is one of several ships dispatched throughout Realmspace to intercept the characters and retrieve Miken. Qitru and her githyanki shipmates were told that Miken is traveling aboard a tyrant ship with several other cadets. Qitru's ship was positioned in the right place at the right time to intercept the tyrant ship on its way from H'Catha to Toril.

![[042-03-006.star-lancer.webp|right|300]]

Qitru doesn't know the tyrant ship's combat capabilities, so she's not willing to risk her entire crew to retrieve Miken. If the characters tell Qitru that Miken is not aboard the tyrant ship, Qitru assumes they are either lying to protect Miken. She asks, "Why risk your lives to protect a traitor?" She then demands that they produce Miken at once. If the characters refuse or reassert the fact that Miken is not aboard, Qitru and the star lancer attack.

#### Spoiling for a Fight
If combat ensues, Qitru and the star lancer close to melee range. When Qitru or the star lancer has fewer than 20 hit points remaining, Qitru orders the star lancer to retreat. On its next turn, the star lancer uses Invisibility Cloak and flies back toward the asteroid. If the star lancer dies before it can escape, Qitru casts misty step on her next turn, teleports next to a character, and attacks with her greatsword.

If a character uses the *sending stone* to request help from Boatswain Tarto, she says, "I'll be right there!" and heads to the Hollow Deck. Tarto is armed with a musket (+7 to hit) that deals 1d12 + 3 piercing damage on a hit.

#### Capturing Qitru
If Qitru is captured, the characters can interrogate her. Under interrogation, she reveals the following information:

- Qitru and her crew work for a mercane named Vocath.
- Vocath has several vessels looking for the tyrant ship.
- The damselfly ship hiding behind the asteroid has a four giff and four githyanki aboard it.

***Strange Sigil.*** Characters who search Qitru or observe her closely notice a strange sigil tattooed on the back of her right hand. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the tattoo. The tattoo is Vocath's sigil, worn by those who are closest to the mercane.

### Onward
Saerthe guides the tyrant ship out of the debris field and continues toward Toril. The ship picks up speed once it gets a mile away from the asteroid. Saerthe's priority is to get back to Toril and make sure Spelljammer Academy knows that Vocath has operatives searching for Miken. "Hopefully, we'll get to him before they do," Saerthe remarks.

#### Damselfly Ship
The damselfly ship has a crew of four **giff shipmates** and four **githyanki warriors** (not including Qitru). As the tyrant ship moves away from the asteroid, the damselfly's canny giff captain, Mustaf Shultz, instructs the ship's spelljammer, a githyanki named Nalvoor, to follow the tyrant ship to Toril while keeping a safe distance.

The characters encounter the damselfly ship again in the next part of the adventure.

## Part 3: Homecoming
Ten days after their encounter near the asteroid, the characters return to Toril:

>>Shortly after Saerthe parks the tyrant ship in orbit around Toril, the hammerhead ship *Flighty Foundling* arrives to give you, Saerthe, and Boatswain Tarto a lift back to the academy. Seasoned staff are left behind to take care of the tyrant ship.
>>
>>After returning to Spelljammer Academy on the island of Nimbral, Tarto tells you to get some rest while she and Saerthe brief the senior staff. Tarto orders you to stay away from Miken and report for maintenance work in the morning.
>>

The characters aren't allowed to attend the senior staff briefing or see Miken, who is confined to his quarters. Two **veterans** stand guard outside Miken's room, the door to which has an *arcane lock* spell cast on it.

### Extraction Force
When the characters report for duty the next morning, they're assigned to maintenance work on the *Flighty Foundling*: scrubbing decks and making minor repairs. The *Flighty Foundling* is moored on the side of the Spelljammer Academy's structure, about 400 feet above the Sea Dock, roughly at the level of the Gymnasium (see handout 1).

The characters' work is interrupted by a strike force that is determined to retrieve Miken and commandeer the *Flighty Foundling*.

### Fight for the Foundling
Read the following:

>>As you're deep in your tasks, a shadow of another ship passes over the deck of the *Flighty Foundling*. The ship looks like it's preparing to dock on the level directly above you. The ship looks like a giant metal insect, its hull gleaming in the sunlight.
>>
>>Ropes drop from the vessel and land on the main deck of the *Flighty Foundling*, near the sterncastle. Two brawny, hippo-headed Humanoids dressed for combat zip down the lines on steel loops. They land on the deck with a resounding thud. One of them points at you, snorts, and says, "Get off our ship."
>>

As soon as the giff land on the *Flighty Foundling*, the damselfly ship swings around to the other side of the academy's tower, heading to make its second deposit—the team to extract Miken. The damselfly ship then departs.

#### Creatures
The two **giff shipmates** have orders to secure the *Flighty Foundling* while an extraction team retrieves Miken, dead or alive. The giff give the characters a chance to flee the vessel. If the characters stand their ground, the giff hurl grenades at them before closing to melee range.

If captured and interrogated, the giff reveal that they take their orders from Mustaf Shultz, the giff captain of the damselfly ship, who takes his orders from Vocath the mercane. Shultz and his fellow giff are mercenaries, and Vocath pays them well for their loyalty.

#### Hammerhead Ship
For this encounter, use the hammerhead ship deck map below. Boatswain Tarto and the characters are on the forecastle when the giff land on the main deck near the sterncastle.

![[044-map-3.02-hammerhead-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)***Shipboard Weapons.*** The ballista on the forecastle takes 1 action to load, 1 action to aim, and 1 action to fire. A ballista bolt (+6 to hit) deals 16 (3d10) piercing damage on a hit. The hammerhead ship's mangonels are undergoing maintenance and have no ammunition available.

***Shoved Overboard.*** A creature that is pushed over the edge of the ship must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to grab hold of the side of the ship. On a failure, the creature plunges down to the water 400 feet below, taking 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage.

#### Another Attack?
Right as their fight with the giff concludes, the characters hear an explosion coming from the other side of the academy, in the direction of the cadet quarters. They now have a choice: head toward what is clearly another attack (continue with "Freeing Miken" below) or remain aboard the *Flighty Foundling* (skip ahead to "Staying Put").

### Freeing Miken
If the characters leave the ship and race toward the cadet quarters, they hear sounds of musket fire as they get closer to Miken's quarters. (See the inset map in the Spelljammer Academy map, handout 1.) They soon come upon the extraction crew:

>>You reach the bottom of the stairs and see a corridor filled with smoke. A half dozen dead bodies litter the hallway floor. Coming toward you, obscured by the smoke, are two gaunt figures in armor. One clutches a greatsword, while the other holds a struggling, badly wounded Miken Haverstance.
>>

#### Hallway Features
The hallway in the cadet quarters is 10 feet wide and 60 feet to the bend at the south. The bodies on the floor belong to two dead sailors, two dead guards, and two dead members of the extraction force—one giff and one githyanki. Two rooms lie east of the characters: a laundry room about 20 feet from the stairs, and another dormitory 20 feet beyond that.

The hallway has the following features:

***Errant Grenade.*** One of the dead giff's grenades was primed but not released when the giff died at the bend in the corridor. At the end of each turn in combat, roll a d6. On a 6, the grenade rolls from the giff's hand and goes off. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius area of the bend in the south end of the corridor must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Light.*** This area is brightly lit by *continual flame* spells cast on wall sconces.

***Smoke.*** The smoke is from a smoke bomb dropped by the giff when the extraction force moved to break Miken out of his makeshift brig. The smoke makes the hallway lightly obscured.

![[045-03-007.githyanki-warrior.webp|right|300]]

#### Creatures
Two wounded **githyanki warriors** (each with 30 hit points remaining) have Miken (an **apprentice wizard** with 2 hit points remaining and at-will spells only) in custody. The githyanki are heading toward the *Flighty Foundling* when the characters intercept them. The githyanki don't bother engaging in dialogue. One of them grapples Miken while the other one attacks.

If one githyanki falls in battle, the other githyanki uses its next action to try to slay Miken and take his head. One hit is enough to drop Miken to 0 hit points, and a follow-up swing with a greatsword is enough to decapitate him. If the characters defeat the githyanki before Miken can be killed, Miken crumples to the ground and weeps like a baby. He neither helps nor harms the characters.

#### Never Fear, Wizpop Is Here!
If the characters are in danger of being defeated by the githyanki, help comes from an unlikely source.

The dormitory near the laundry room is the new temporary quarters for Wizpop, the autognome rescued by the characters in the previous adventure. Wizpop has been hiding in his room ever since the fighting broke out. Once he spies the characters, he gets the courage to make his presence known to them. Read the following:

>>From the room nearby, a tinny voice quietly says, "Over here. I can help!"
>>

Wizpop is a noncombatant but has found his courage and wants to help in this dire situation. The characters might have him go to get additional help or cause a distraction. If he goes to find help, a few rounds later he returns with two guards (use the **veteran** stat block) to aid in the fight.

### Staying Put
If the characters chose to remain aboard the *Flighty Foundling*, the two wounded survivors of Vocath's extraction force come to them with Miken in tow:

>>Two gaunt figures in blood-spattered armor emerge from the academy onto the platform where your ship is moored. One clutches a greatsword, while the other holds a struggling, badly wounded Miken Haverstance.
>>

#### Creatures
The two **githyanki warriors** (each with 30 hit points remaining) have Miken (an **apprentice wizard** with 2 hit points remaining and at-will spells only) in custody. One of them grapples Miken while the other one uses *misty step* to board the ship and attack.

If one githyanki falls in battle, the other githyanki uses its next action to try to slay Miken and take his head. One hit is enough to drop Miken to 0 hit points, and a follow-up swing with a greatsword is enough to decapitate him. If the characters defeat the githyanki before Miken can be killed, Miken crumples to the ground and weeps like a baby. He neither helps nor harms the characters.

If the githyanki defeat or drive off the characters, one of them begins the process of attuning to the *spelljamming helm*. The githyanki doesn't finish the process—Mirt shows up with some aides to defeat the githyanki before too long. If one or more characters are dying, Mirt shows up in time for those characters to be saved by his aides.

![[046-03-008.star-moth-splash.webp|right|300]]

### After the Attack
The following sections tie up a few loose ends.

#### Strange Sigils
Characters who defeat the githyanki and examine them closely notice a strange sigil tattooed on the back of each githyanki's right hand. A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the tattoo. The tattoo is Vocath's sigil, worn by those who are closest to the mercane. If the tattoos are brought to the attention of Saerthe or Tarto, they mention it to Mirt a few hours later. Mirt knows exactly what the symbol means, and eventually the characters are told as well. It is the mark of Vocath's personal retinue; only the mercane's most trusted operatives earn it.

#### Miken's Fate
If he survives the attack, Miken is sentenced to five years of hard labor, to be served at a penal colony on a small island off the Sword Coast. He plans to turn over a new leaf and hopes to see the characters again once he's a free man.

#### Damselfly's Escape
After dropping off the extraction force, the damselfly ship is chased away by another spelljamming vessel. The pursuing vessel, which is crewed by academy cadets on a training exercise, is slower than the fleeing damselfly ship. At your discretion, the damselfly ship might reappear in some later adventure, with Mustaf Shultz in command and the githyanki Nalvoor at the helm.

### Graduation Day
Two weeks after the attack, Graduation Day finally arrives. During the graduation ceremony, each character is brought forward and recognized for their deeds with great fanfare. Toward the end of the ceremony, Mirt closes out with a few words memorializing those that were recently lost and promises to keep Spelljammer Academy open and safe.

Each character can choose to remain at the Spelljammer Academy as a newly minted sailor in the ranks of the Spelljammers or the Spelljammer Corps. Conversely, the characters can enroll in a placement program whereby they are assigned to a ship under the command of a captain who is friendly toward Mirt and Spelljammer Academy. The characters are then dispatched to a coastal city and told to await the ship's arrival.

#### Graduation Gifts
As a reward for their heroism, each character can choose one item from the following list as a graduation gift:

- *+1 rod of the pact keeper*
- *+1 shield*
- *+1 weapon*
- *Bag of holding*
- *Goggles of night*

### The End?

>>Your time at Spelljammer Academy is over. The promise of a new adventure awaits in Neverwinter, a city to the north. Boatswain Tarto gnaws on her cigar as she bids you farewell. "Don't forget to write," she says with a grin.
>>
>>Far above you, in the space above Toril, a mothlike ship appears. Its purpose unknown, it waits, biding its time. ...
>>

#### Character Advancement
The characters advance to 5th level and are ready for *Light of Xaryxis*!
