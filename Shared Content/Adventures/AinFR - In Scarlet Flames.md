# In Scarlet Flames
Two Red Wizards of Thay have undertaken a secret mission into the High Moors east of the Sword Coast. They are searching for something or someone. Whatever their goal out there in the cold and windswept hills, if the Red Wizards want to keep it secret then it is probably best uncovered swiftly for the good of everyone else. Even the mercenaries who escorted them into the wilderness earlier agree: someone should stop them.

Pursuing the Red Wizards leads the adventurers to a barrow mound in the wild grasses of the High Moors. At the barrow, they discover the remnants of a wizards' sanctum still being plundered. The fate of its lore and treasures is up to the characters. Without caution, things may get out of hand.

This Dungeons & Dragons® adventure is written to suit four to six characters of 8th level. With this text and the core D&D manuals, you have everything you need to play. You may also benefit from the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide to learn more about the High Moors of Faerûn.

### Start of a Series
This adventure is written as the first in a multi-part series. Whether you're playing this as part of our adventure series or weaving this adventure into another campaign, read "Part 3: What's Next?" to get an idea of where some of these threads lead—and how you can change those threads to accommodate a different campaign.

This adventure foreshadows the role of a recurring villain but does not fully explain his motives, history, or plans. These are matters for the following adventures. If you prefer not to wait, or if you want to substitute another villain in for ours, this adventure can easily foreshadow a villainous NPC of your own.

By combining the immediacy of the players' choices with the mysterious histories and ambitions of key NPCs, you can explore questions of loyalty, ambition, and knowledge in dramatic ways. Future adventures in this series expand on this to explore the past of the Sword Coast and the consequences of the players' choices in each adventure along the way.

## Background
A lone mage roams the land. He is a visitor from another world. He has come to the Sword Coast in pursuit of legends and lore, in the footsteps of others who came here long ago. He is called Tyreus, though few here know him by name.

His explorations caught the attention of the Red Wizards of Thay, who dispatched a pair of their own wizards to find the roving mage. These searchers—Morwena and her apprentice, **Malivar**—tracked the wizard to the High Moors east of the Sword Coast. They surmised (correctly) that their quarry was looking for a site of arcane power.

To find their way through the High Moors and stay on Tyreus's trail, the Red Wizards hired local mercenaries to guide them, led by a former bandit called Lothar.

When the Red Wizards drew close to their target at a site colloquially called the Wizard's Barrow, Lothar and his mercenaries abandoned the whole enterprise out of fear. They fled back to the village of Secomber, on the edge of the High Moors, where they tell anyone who will listen that bad things are afoot out at the Wizard's Barrow now. "Wizards hunting wizards can lead to no good," Lothar says.

### The Story at the Barrow
The Wizard's Barrow started as a proper barrow and stood quietly in the High Moors for centuries before a sect of wizards moved in, plundered it for treasure, discarded the dead inside the barrow, and used their magic to reshape the place into a remote lair. For years, the wizards used this place as a sanctum, laboratory, library, and eventually a tomb for members of their small order. Whatever became of the final members of the order, they never returned to this place.

For decades, it stood quietly.

Then, a few days ago, Tyreus arrived with elementals in his service. The elementals dug into the ground near the barrow to get access to its lowest reaches. That created the sinkhole just east of the barrow, into area 15. From there, Tyreus and his minions stormed the library in area 14.

For two days, Tyreus searched the library for items of value. When Morwena and **Malivar** arrived, they confronted him in a brief skirmish of spells before choosing to parley.

Morwena, intrigued by the roving wizard and hungry for the power he offered, chose to abandon her mission and join Tyreus. **Malivar** thought it was a trick. It wasn't.

**Malivar**, afraid and heartbroken, threatened them both but was no match for either. Struck by Tyreus's spells, he fled the library, deeper into the barrow, and collapsed on the verge of death. (He is likely still in area 13 when the adventurers arrive.)

Morwena suggested they let **Malivar** go, as she wasn't worried about reprisal from the Red Wizards anymore. She and her new ally teleported away with their treasures, leaving the elemental minions to close up the barrow again and burn the library to cover their master's tracks.

The lead minion, a fire spirit called **Exul**, toils under a geas from the roving wizard. He has gathered and piled scrolls and books from the library to burn them but has stopped to read all he can before he destroys them.

## Adventure Hook
Adventurers passing through the village of Secomber might hear about the Red Wizards and their mission by chance. For some adventurers, interfering with Red Wizards or uncovering lost treasure may be enough motivation to continue.

If coincidence isn't enough, consider the following adventure hooks and how they can get adventurers to Secomber.

#### Pursuit of the Red Wizards
An ally or patron of the adventurers hears word that two Red Wizards have ventured toward the High Moors in search of something. Perhaps that ally has a fraught history with the Red Wizards; perhaps the adventurers already do too.

#### Lost Lore
A historian, sage, or other learned figure asks the adventurers to investigate the legends of the Wizard's Barrow in the High Moor. "Start in the village of Secomber," they say. "Someone there might remember rumors of wizards roaming the moors."
---
# Part 1: The Village of Secomber
The village of Secomber sits with its back against a riverside cliff made of pink granite. The village center is mostly modest cottages and shops, with homes and farms lining the roads out of town and the top of the cliffs overlooking Hark River. Across the water, green hills rise to become the High Moors.

Whatever brings the characters to Secomber, they hear word of Lothar and his party's recent return from the High Moors. Whether he drinks nearby or tells his story out on the street, Lothar brags about how lucky he and his crew are to be alive "after almost being murdered by Red Wizards."

#### The Mercenaries' Accounts
Lothar Stoutsmark (male human, chaotic neutral, **bandit captain**) is a forty-year-old braggart who values survival above all else. His "gold" teeth are fake. He and his crew (Gordo, Vic, and Rora) consider themselves adventurers but tend toward sordid work and skullduggery. Lothar is one lean month away from returning to highway robbery, and his allies (all **spies**) are one bad day from abandoning him, unbeknown to Lothar. Lothar knows the following information about the Red Wizards and their mission:

- "Those Red Wizards are called Morwena and **Malivar**. He used to be her apprentice and she still puts him in his place, you know? He doesn't like it."
- "Morwena, she said the barrow they were looking for might contain great treasure. She seemed to doubt it was a barrow at all, though. She called it a 'sanctum.'"
- "She maybe meant the Wizard's Barrow, which was used for strange rites for decades—thunder, lightning—but apparently never opened."
- "Anyway, them Red Wizards, they're chasing someone. Another wizard, from a rival group, maybe? Sounded like they wanted him alive."
- "We made good time, crossing the hills. I know good trails. But one night, Morwena told **Malivar** she didn't think they needed guides anymore. So we left, before they could kill us."

Lothar can point the way to the Wizard's Barrow: it is a mere 6-hour hike into the High Moors, about 18 miles southeast of Secomber.
---
# Part 2: The Wizard's Barrow
When the adventurers arrive, the barrow has already been entered (twice) and partly plundered. The barrow's three levels, and a side view, are presented in the included maps (See Appendix).

### Entryway
The main entryway to the barrow was the only entrance into the site until Tyreus arrived. Located at the western end of the structure and marked by two large standing stones etched with faded spiral sigils, the entrance is a weather-worn set of stairs interrupted by an upright stone slab. It was never a door, but a seal.

Morwena and **Malivar** forced the seal open when they arrived. Now the barrow stands open to the winds and gathering rains of the High Moors. Anyone can descend the steep, worn steps and enter.

### General Features
After its origins as a barrow grave in ancient times, the interior of the Wizard's Barrow has been refashioned with magic and more modern crafting techniques. The top level remains the oldest in fashion, combining original stone slabs with mortar and stones from about a century ago.

The second and third levels of the site consist of gray, cut stones slowly giving way after decades without maintenance—made all the worse by side effects of the sinkhole opening up outside. Cracks and gaps now reach into the second level of the site. Some areas are in danger of collapsing into the library below. Clever adventurers may find a way to take advantage of these dangers; others may succumb to them.

#### Ceilings
Each level features rough, uneven ceilings about 8 feet high, left unfinished for cosmetic effect by the wizards of old.

#### Doors
On the first level, doors are ramshackle, rotten things, lightweight and easily opened or broken. Except where otherwise noted, doors of the lower two levels are sturdy but small for their frames, unlikely to stick in place even after all these years.

#### Light
The first level has no usable, surviving light sources. The second and third levels feature periodic wall sconces housing glassy stones magically enchanted to give off dim light. Most of them still work.

#### Sound
The barrow would be silent if not for intruders. Since the sinkhole damaged the site, sound now carries from the second level to the third where the floors are cracked and giving way.

### 1. Guard Chamber
The wizards meant for this chamber to be a guard post, but rather than bring people out here who weren't wizards in their little sect, they later opted to trap the chamber with an experimental magic glyph. (The wizards mostly came and went by teleportation circles in the library anyway.)

>>The winds and the chill from outside make their way into this chamber. The remains of wooden stools and a rack of rotten spears suggest this was a guard station once. A squat stele, about three feet tall, stands in the center of the chamber now, marked with a single, deeply etched glyph of bright blue. A silver medallion hangs from the top of the stele, partly blocking the glyph.
>>

The stele is marked with a glyph akin to a glyph of warding, but it differs in important ways. Several of these trapped steles can be found throughout the barrow.

Wooden scraps or detritus in this chamber catch fire if the trap goes off, but the fire has nowhere to spread.

The medallion was set on the stele long ago to prevent its trap from going off. The trap cannot see around the medallion. Removing the medallion makes the stele's trap active again, though whoever wears or carries the medallion does not trigger the trap.

Morwena and **Malivar** ignored the stele and the medallion in their rush to reach the library.

#### Trapped Steles
The barrow's trapped steles were crafted with effects not unlike a glyph of warding. However, the steles' glyphs are plain to see even in dim light. Each trapped stele can be activated multiple times; exactly how many depends on the individual stele. When the stele detects a trespasser in front of its glyph it immediately emits a stroke of lightning at the trespasser. If a targeted trespasser does not leave the area, the stele emits lightning again on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties).

Anyone not named when the stele was crafted is considered a trespasser unless they wear or carry a medallion of safe passage.

***Guard Chamber Trapped Stele.*** This trapped stele detects trespassers in a 30-foot cone in front of its glyph. It has a passive Perception score of 18. To disarm or dispel the trap requires a successful DC 18 check. Any creature that triggers the trap and fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage with a successful save.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. This stele can emit lightning a total of five times before becoming nothing more than inert stone.

#### Medallion of Safe Passage
The medallion is silver-plated copper engraved with the same glyph as the stele, so the medallion appears coppery. Any creature wearing or visibly carrying one of these medallions does not trigger a trapped stele. The medallion is not magical. It is simply recognized by the steles, throughout the barrow, granting safe passage past their traps.

### 2. Moldering Supplies

>>A few open crates, rotten sacks of grain, and scattered heaps of straw stand against the wall here. These supplies could've lasted weeks, once. An iron crowbar sits rusting atop the only closed crate.
>>

The floor angles down here before leveling off in the passage and chambers. This room was once the supply cache and pantry for the site. Most of what was left here has rotted to waste.

***Treasure.*** The closed crate contains five golden oil lamps, porcelain wares, and three copper ingots altogether worth 140 gp.

### 3. Rotten Common Room

>>Ornately woven red rugs cover much of the uneven floor of this chamber, held down by deep, leather chairs and a split, collapsed table. One wall boasts a goldpainted frame and a smoke-darkened painting of Sword Coast cliffs. The sideboard practically bows from the weight of silver goblets, tea pots, and more.
>>

This chamber was once a common room and dining area for the site. The furnishings that once made it comfortable are still here, caked with dust, damp, and debris.

***Treasure.*** The silver wares, tea pots, and serving trays here are collectively worth 310 gp. The landscape painting is a lost work by a beloved Waterdhavian artist named Saraque Skyhill worth 1,200 gp if properly conserved.

### 4. Abandoned Quarters

>>The air in here is damp and chill. It smells like hay left to rot.
>>

Each of these chambers was a private room for a member of the sect who visited or worked on site regularly. Personal effects have mostly been removed, leaving these feeling more like cells than bedrooms. Forgotten bedrolls and empty, unlocked chests are all that remain in most rooms.

#### 4A: Hidden Shrine
This chamber hides a secret door leading to a hidden shrine.

The secret door is little more than a hatch behind this room's empty chest, hidden by dried mud and a slab meant to look like part of the wall. The door can be spotted with a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check or passive score.

>>A little stone altar just two feet wide stands here buried in black dirt at the foot of a narrow chimney that seems to have fallen in. Something glints amid the dirt.
>>

The hidden shrine itself is half-buried in dirt and loam at the bottom of a once-empty chimney, meant to allow the shrine to see the stars. Whatever deity was once honored here, all that remains are melted candles, 1 sp, and a medallion of safe passage.

### 5. Ceremonial Entryway
The north, east, and west walls are made of plaster adorned with colorful but smoke-faded murals. Each mural depicts figures in stark robes—some red, some green, some blue—painted as if they are part of a procession carrying trays of fire, lit incense, and silver toward the doorway to area 6.

>>Murals along three walls portray figures in bright robes of green or red or blue marching in file through an abstract environment suggesting perhaps a bright garden and stained glass. These figures are all human in size but depicted in various fashions and styles beneath their robes. The south wall is bare, unfinished slabs of stone, marking the original outer edge of the barrow.
>>

The secret door to area 7 is a narrow wooden section hidden under the plaster, decorated by a figure in green robes with one hand over his eyes. The door can be found with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check.

### 6. Descent Passage
The painted plaster walls continue into this area, depicting robed wizards headed toward the stairs down to area 8. But here, the wizards' robes are multi-colored.

>>The robed figures on these walls wear detailed, multi-colored robes with cuffs and hems adorned with magic words and sigils. Some of these figures wear long beards or long braids; others are clad in buckled bands of leather and sleek leggings. Each one is depicted carrying treasures or offerings toward the stairs that descend deeper ahead.
>>

The stairs down to the second level mark the start of the finer, more modern stonework of the site's lower two levels.

### 7. Observer's Chamber
Wizards used this chamber to observe newcomers to the sect as they performed rites and recited chants in the ceremonial entryway (area 5) and descended the stairs (area 6).

>>From inside, the northern and eastern walls of this room appear translucent, though hazy and smeared, like peering through rainy glass.
>>

The walls are quite solid to the touch. Anyone in this room can focus their attention to see and hear into areas 5 and 6. The passive Perception scores of creatures in this chamber suffer a–5 penalty while observing the adjoining chambers.

### 8. Second-Level Passageways
These passages of fitted stone blocks are sturdy and intact throughout much of the second level—but not all of it. Between the ritual chambers (areas 10, 11, and 12), the floor has been shaken and cracked by side effects from the sinkhole collapse nearby. Everything in area 8 is capable of supporting the weight of the adventurers but can also reveal light and carry sound to **Exul** in the grand library below (area 14).

Creatures in area 14 have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to peer up into this area and a–5 penalty to passive Perception to idly notice things in this area.

Adventurers attempting to observe the grand library through the flooring here also have disadvantage on their checks, unless they get down on the floor to peer through gaps.

### 9. Component Vault

>>This sturdy wooden door, bound in iron straps and hinges, has stood strong against the passage of time.
>>

This door is locked (DC 16 to pick the lock) and well built (Strength DC 20 to break it down) but the chamber's primary defense is the trapped stele inside.

***Vault Stele.*** This trapped stele detects trespassers it can see in a 60-foot cone in front of its glyph. It has a passive Perception score of 16. To disarm or dispel the trap requires a successful DC 16 check. Any creature that triggers the trap and fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage with a successful save.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

This stele can emit lightning a total of three times before becoming nothing more than inert stone. Beyond the stele, this place is a kind of arcane pantry.

>>This chamber houses clay urns, glass jars, and wooden boxes arranged haphazardly on wall-mounted shelves and caked in years of dust.
>>

#### Treasure
These containers once held spell components. Most have been carried off or have rotted away, but one urn still holds 440 gp worth of diamond dust and a wooden box contains a coil of gold twine almost 3 feet long, worth 290 gp. A medallion of safe passage hangs from a hook on the southern wall.

> ##### Collapsing Floors
>The floors in areas 10, 11, and 12 are precarious. For every 20 feet of movement across these floors by a creature bearing more than 100 pounds (including itself), there is a 25 percent chance that the floor groans and crumbles away into area 14. If a trapped stele activates in these areas, there is a 50 percent chance the floor immediately collapses.
>
>A successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check allows someone to collapse the floor intentionally. A crowbar or other leverage grants advantage on the check.
>
>Creatures in or beneath the area when the floor collapses must attempt a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw within 5 feet of the walls can choose to cling to the nearest wall to avoid damage and a fall. Otherwise, any creature in this area when the floor gives way tumbles down into area 14.
>
>***Falling Steles.*** Any trapped stele that tumbles into area 14 survives the fall and continues to function normally. The DM decides the facing of such steles; they may fire into area 14 or up into other areas, depending on how they land.

### 10. Ritual Casting Chamber (North)

>>The floor is etched deep with overlapping geometries, but much of the stone in the floor looks rough, ragged, and upset. Cracks in the north and east walls suggest the structural damage runs deep into the earth.
>>

Wizards used this chamber to cast ritual spells without distraction, to perform rites sacred to the old sect, and to observe apprentices as they practiced their work.

Any checks to sneak through this chamber without attracting the attention of creatures in area 14 are made with disadvantage.

The etchings along the wall are instructions for casting detect magic and identify as a ritual, but no power has been imbued within the words, so they are little more than mnemonics for apprentice wizards.

***Ritual Casting Stele.*** This trapped stele detects trespassers it can see in a 60-foot cone in front of its glyph. It has a passive Perception score of 16. To disarm or dispel the trap requires a successful DC 16 check. Any creature that triggers the trap and fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage with a successful save.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. This stele can emit lightning a total of three times before becoming inert stone.

### 11. Ritual Casting Chamber (South)

>>Various hooks and pegs suggest this large room once housed tapestries and other finery. The floor is etched with geometric shapes, but the stones of the floor look sunken and loose. Deep cracks in the floor have broken whole stones apart.
>>
>>On the southern wall hang three evenly spaced golden discs, shaped like serving plates and studded with red gems. Beneath them stands a stout stele marked with a bright blue glyph.
>>

Like area 10, this chamber was used for rituals, rites, and practice. Unlike that chamber, this room is still adorned with precious trinkets leftover from some past rite.

Any checks to sneak through this chamber without attracting the attention of creatures in area 14 are made with disadvantage.

***Ritual Casting Stele.*** This trapped stele detects trespassers it can see in a 60-foot cone in front of its glyph. It has a passive Perception score of 16. To disarm or dispel the trap requires a successful DC 16 check. Any creature that triggers the trap and fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage with a successful save.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. This stele can emit lightning a total of three times before becoming inert stone.

***Treasure.*** The three golden plates on the southern wall were part of some rite or ritual, now forgotten. Each plate, worth 300 gp, is a thin disc of gold inset with five red garnets.

### 12. Laboratory Chamber

>>Stray stones and dirt have been scattered across the floor by seismic activity or some other serious damage. Heavy-duty wooden tables and empty wooden bookcases still stand here, but the stones beneath them look shaken, cracked, and uneven. The air smells like raw clay.
>>

This used to be a laboratory, but aside from the heavy tables, shelves, and trapped steles, this place has been tidily cleaned out. The steles were made here; the two that remain are functional but appear unfinished.

Any checks to sneak through this chamber without attracting the attention of creatures in area 14 are made with disadvantage.

***Laboratory Steles.*** These two trapped steles detect trespassers they can see in 60-foot cones in front of their glyphs. Each has a passive Perception score of 15. To disarm or dispel either trap requires a successful DC 15 check. Any creature that triggers the trap and fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage with a successful save. The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

Each of these steles can emit lightning twice before becoming inert stone.

### 13. Common Catacomb

>>The passage here is rough stone, a gravel floor, and glimpses of white cloth—and yellowed bone. It's a catacomb, without much fanfare or adornment. A human skull stares at you from a nearby shelf.
>>

This rough-hewn catacomb is lined with three inset shelves for the dead. Here the wizards interred the original inhabitants of the barrow above, as well as servants and some other friends and allies of the site who passed away during its years in operation. Each was wrapped in gray or white cloth and put in place without grave goods or treasures. (Wizards of the sect are in area 16.)

**Malivar** is here, likely unconscious, after almost being killed by Tyreus's spells. He has 1 hit point. If awakened, he tries to assess his situation rather than immediately fight or flee.

**Malivar** reveals the following bits of information if the adventurers talk with him. If threatened, he attempts to keep quiet.

- The wizard they pursued here is called Tyreus.
- Tyreus is a powerful archmage from another world. He's here looking for an ancient site of mystical power. "We tried to recruit him."
- He had a hefty tome bound in white leather with five sigils on the front, held close to him. "That's what he came for, whatever it is."
- Morwena's allegiance to the Red Wizards has been wavering. She felt they were holding her back from the kind of arcane power she really wanted. "I wish I wasn't surprised that she turned on me. I mean, us."

### 14. Grand Library

>>A grand chamber sprawls out here in contrast to the confines of any common barrow. Between the sagging stone ceiling and the polished stone floor stand at least a dozen wooden shelves holding stacked scrolls and bound tomes. The wood here is polished almost red, from the shelves to the wide tables and chairs scattered throughout.
>>
>>But the place has been ransacked. Furniture is on its side, papers are scattered everywhere, and bits of masonry lie about here and there. The center of the room is a huge heap of open, damaged books and unfurled scrolls. The place smells like smoke.
>>

![[image-064.webp|right|300]]

This was the heart of the site, when the wizards used it so many years ago. Many texts were gradually removed as the sect's power dwindled, but most of it remains here. The last of the wizards didn't know they were never coming back when they left for the last time.

Tyreus and Morwena left hours ago after ordering the fiery humanoid elemental, named **Exul**, the destroy the library's collection. (Tyreus is simply covering his tracks.) This order is part of a geas Tyreus cast upon **Exul**.

Tyreus left with an arcane tome in hand and Morwena at his side but didn't tell **Exul** where they were going. **Exul**'s service ends with the destruction of the library.

***The Fire Spirit.*** **Exul** kills time here while he can, reading what he is about to burn. He sits atop a pile of scrolls and books in the middle of the room and allows himself to be distracted by his reading unless intruders catch his attention. He thinks **Malivar** has died or fled and acts as if he has the barrow to himself and his elementals. While distracted by his reading, he has a–5 penalty to his passive Perception score.

If he suspects he is no longer alone, he carries on idly reading and burning texts but no longer allows himself to be distracted.

If he knows intruders are present, he summons an elemental to defend him—probably a fire elemental, as it can help him burn the library or slip into area 15 to aid the elementals there, as needed. As he can, **Exul** resumes his task of burning the library so he can leave without taking damage from the geas upon him.

**Exul** is a cunning, unfair combatant. He uses invisibility to protect himself. He hurls fire and casts *wall of fire* to accelerate his work. If either he or the library has fewer than 25 percent of their hit point maximum, **Exul** may attempt to flee by casting plane shift and traveling alone to the Elemental Plane of Fire. He might do this even if his task is incomplete, risking damage from Tyreus's geas. **Exul** is smart but reckless. He leaves any elementals behind to combat the adventurers.

***Teleportation Circles.*** Two teleportation circles used to serve this chamber and the wizards who kept this collection. The northern circle has been damaged by the sinkhole's collapse. (It used to lead to a now-ruined wizard's tower overlooking the Sword Coast.) The southern circle leads to an abandoned townhouse in Waterdeep; the circle there is beneath the floorboards in the attic. (See "Part 3: What's Next?" for additional options.)

***Treasure.*** To historians, sages, and collectors in a college or university, the value of the library's nonmagical collection is up to 5,500 gp. Three *spell scrolls* also remain in the collection: one scroll of *chain lightning*, one scroll of *Otiluke's freezing sphere*, and one scroll of *wall of stone*.

#### The Burning Library
In this library—littered with stray pages, tables, chairs, and rugs—fire spreads 5 feet in any direction on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), as sheets of fiery paper flit about on fire-hot winds. Each 5-foot square that is burning deals 3 (1d6) fire damage to the library, to a maximum of 42 (12d6) fire damage each turn.

A creature that starts its turn in a burning space takes 3 (1d6) fire damage. A creature without resistance to fire damage has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to see through the smoke and fire here.

The chamber survives the fire even if it is a charred husk billowing smoke into upper levels and into area 15 and the open air.

It is the collection that's in jeopardy. The library collection has 300 hit points and no damage threshold. Consult the Collection Damage Results table to determine what survives based on damage suffered by the collection.

#### Fighting the Fire
What the adventurers use to combat the flames is up to them. Water is not plentiful here, but earth and dirt are in great supply.

Presume any ability check to put out fire by nonmagical means requires a successful DC 15 check, the ability of which depends on what the characters are trying to do. Success on such a check puts out fire in a 10-foot square or equivalent area.

If cold damage caused in any 5-foot-square area exceeds the damage being dealt in that area by the blaze, that 5-foot square's fire goes out. Persistent ice or other lingering effects keep fire from spreading.

##### Collection Damage Results
| Damage Suffered | Result |
|---|---|
| 0–50 hp | Minor losses: Only lore and legends are burned, and the value of the collection is reduced by 500 gp. |
| 51–100 hp | Moderate losses: One *spell scroll* is destroyed, and the value of the collection is reduced by 1,500 gp. |
| 101–200 hp | Major losses: Two spell scrolls are destroyed, and the value of the collection is reduced by 3,000 gp. |

Otherwise, an area might burn again if fire spreads and the collection still has hit points remaining.

> ##### Chaos in the Collection
>Between collapsing stone, errant lightning, and spreading flames, things can get messy here in a hurry. Add in **Malivar**, **Exul**, and other elementals and things go beyond hectic. The players' choices might well make things easier or more difficult for them—that's fair. All these moving parts are here to create options and unexpected interactions.
>
>If circumstances do turn against the adventurers, it can be dire. Depending on the monsters involved, a battle in the library can become an encounter of Deadly magnitude.
>
>Keep in mind that defeating the adventurers isn't a goal of the NPCs or monsters here. Combat isn't an essential outcome. Anyone might be driven to flee if things go sideways—even the elementals. If the library burns to ash, then it does.
>

### 15. Processional Hall

>>Bits of curved marble and stone discs that used to form columns suggest a place that was important once. Now it is smashed to ruin.
>>
>>Some of the stones move about on their own, picking through the rubble.
>>

This wide passage was once a memorial site of gray stone and white marble details. The arrival of Tyreus and his elementals shattered the columns, arches, and mosaics. All that remains are drab heaps of stone dotted with bits of tile and marble. The floor is essentially a pit of rubble now, gathering soil, rocks, and grasses from the sinkhole collapse all around.

This whole area is difficult terrain. The doors to area 14 are loose on their hinges and blocked by a slab of stone that keeps them from opening. Tyreus didn't want to be followed. The stone requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to move aside or a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to wiggle past.

This area is inhabited for now by two earth elementals lingering here after helping Tyreus reach this place. They are not afraid to engage in combat, but neither is willing to die here. They flee into the earth if reduced to 25 percent of their hit points, possibly to return days later for further exploring.

### 16. Honored Crypts
The ceremonial hall was meant to end in a fresco depicting a starry sky, the moon, and its tail. Much of that fresco has fallen away with Tyreus's arrival, revealing bare, gray stone underneath—a wall that hides a door, which was never meant to be opened. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the door amid the rubble.

>>The gray, unadorned passage beyond the fresco hangs with an eerie, dusty fog.

The passage and crypts beyond the door are simple and spare. The sarcophagi in areas 16A through 16D are simply carved to depict the various, forgotten wizards inside. No grandeur. Each is depicted in a simple robe.

Alas, some of the dead wizards interred in these crypts, stirred by anger and unrest, rise to defend the crypts. These 1d4 + 2 **mummies** are not sandy, arid creatures but gaunt, gray horrors clad in gray robes, but their rotting fists remain deadly.

Each mummy moves to escape its crypt and attack trespassers, whether that means the adventurers, elementals, **Malivar**, or anyone else. They return to their crypts if they cannot find targets within 100 feet of the crypts' secret door, returning as necessary to drive off intruders. They do not seal themselves in and do not open the door of their own accord.

***Treasure.*** The crypts are fairly sparely appointed, as the wizards interred here left their belongings to the library and their apprentices. Still, a few silver vases, golden urns, and goblets, altogether worth 300 gp, can be found here. Area 16C includes a small obsidian statue of a medusa with emerald eyes worth 425 gp.

# Part 3: What's Next?
The adventurers may have treasure to sell and lore to lend, or questions in mind and wounds to tend. The aftermath of this adventure is a bundle of questions, so focus on the characters and what they want to do next, perhaps with downtime activities. If they want to chase down Tyreus and Morwena, that trail might simply go cold—for now. Their threads reappear in the next adventure: *The Hidden Page*.

### The Barrow Wizards
Gifting or selling the library's remains, and any other treasures, might occupy the adventurers until the next adventure. The barrow, or what's left of it, might be of interest to sages—or the adventurers might keep it for themselves.

Investigations into the identities and fates of the barrow wizards doesn't reveal tremendous secrets but neither does it yield many answers. The following items of lore are important for the next adventure, but much about those old wizards is left for you to decide, customize, or leave in mystery.

- The leader of the barrow wizards' sect was a traveler from "a faraway place" or "a distant world."
- She came to the Sword Coast "looking for answers" and to "study the magic of the Realms." Her followers were scholarly wizards.
- She lived in a townhouse in Waterdeep sometimes, but left it walled up when she returned to her homeland. The sect fell apart without her.

***Teleportation Circles.*** The teleportation circles in the library led to places helpful for the wizards' sect. One led to the attic of the master's boarded-up, derelict townhouse. The other is damaged and presumably not working—or you can use it to plug into your campaign elsewhere.

### The Missing Villains
Tyreus and Morwena magically transported to one of Tyreus's hidden sanctums. Tyreus got what he wanted from the barrow: a tome of magic with a hidden key inside. For now, he and Morwena are working on their magic, getting to know one another, and planning their next moves. The adventurers haven't seen the last of them yet.
