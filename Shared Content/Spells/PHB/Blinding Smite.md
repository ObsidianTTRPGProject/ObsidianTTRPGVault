# Blinding Smite
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra `dice: 3d8|avg` (3d8) radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the spell ends.

A creature [[blinded]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [[blinded]].
