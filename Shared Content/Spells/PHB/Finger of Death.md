# Finger of Death
You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes `dice: 7d8 + 30|avg` (7d8 + 30) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a [[zombie]] that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.
