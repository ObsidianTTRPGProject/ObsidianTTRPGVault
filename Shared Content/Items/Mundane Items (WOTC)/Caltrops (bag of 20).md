# Caltrops (bag of 20)
**Type**: Mundane Item
**Group**: adventuring gear
**Properties**: 
**Weight**: 2 lb.
**Value**: 1 gp
## Description: 
As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.
