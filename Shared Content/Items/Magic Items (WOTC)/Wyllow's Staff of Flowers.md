# Wyllow's Staff of Flowers

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Staff

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Rarity**: Common

**Damages:** 1d6 bludgeoning - versatile (1d8)

## Description

This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of you, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mildscented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would. The staff regains `dice: 1d6+4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.

Wyllow's staff is peculiar in that it can't create roses, which the archdruid dislikes. If a rose is chosen, a daisy grows instead.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
