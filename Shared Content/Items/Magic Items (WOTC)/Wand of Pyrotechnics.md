# Wand of Pyrotechnics

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Wand

**Rarity:** common

**Weight**: 1 lbs.

## Description

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and create a harmless burst of multicolored light at a point you can see up to 60 feet away. The burst of light is accompanied by a crackling noise that can be heard up to 300 feet away. The light is as bright as a torch flame but lasts only a second.

The wand regains `dice: 1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the wand erupts in a harmless pyrotechnic display and is destroyed.
