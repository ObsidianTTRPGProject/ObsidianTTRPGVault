# Smokepowder

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** uncommon

## Description

Smokepowder is a magical explosive chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a firearm. It is stored in airtight wooden kegs or tiny, waterproof leather packets. A packet contains enough smokepowder for five shots, and a keg holds enough smokepowder for five hundred shots.

If smokepowder is set on fire, dropped, or otherwise handled roughly, it explodes and deals fire damage to each creature or object within 20 feet of it: `dice: 1d6` for a packet, `dice: 9d6` for a keg. A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage. Casting [[dispel magic]]  on smokepowder renders it permanently inert.
