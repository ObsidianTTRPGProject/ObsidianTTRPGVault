# Professor Skant

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** Rare

## Description

The [[professor orb]] owned by Vellynne Harpell and stolen by Nass Lantomir calls itself Professor Skant. It is lawful good, and it has a Wisdom of 11 and a Charisma of 9 (*as a professor orb, it has an Intelligence of 18*). It speaks and reads Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Loross (the dead language of the Empire of Netheril). Professor Skant is a chatterbox and assumes all humanoids are dunderheads. When elaborating on its areas of expertise, it adopts an unintentionally patronizing tone. It has the following four areas ofexpertise:

- The history of Netheril (see the "Fate of Netheril" sidebar)
- Vampirism and the traits of vampires
- Rituals surrounding the making, bottling, and drinking of Elverquisst (a rare, ruby-colored elven liquor distilled from sunshine and rare summer fruits)
- The [[tarrasque]] (see the Monster Manual)

When making an Intelligence check to recall lore from any of its areas of expertise, the orb has a +9 bonus to its roll (including its Intelligence modifier).

Professor Skant takes the form of a smooth, solid, 5-pound sphere of smoky gray quartz about the size of a grapefruit. Close examination reveals two or more pinpricks of silver light deep inside the sphere.

Professor Skant can see and hear normally out to a range of 60 feet. Unlike most sentient items, the orb has no will of its own and can't initiate a conflict with the creature in possession of it.

In addition to the knowledge it possesses, Professor Skant can cast the [[mage hand]] cantrip at will. It uses the spell only to transport itself. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence.
