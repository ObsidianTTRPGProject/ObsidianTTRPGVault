## Description

The Lost Sword is a sentient lawful good [[+1 shortsword]] (Intelligence 11, Wisdom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

The sword's purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties:

- The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.
- A lawful good creature can attune itself to the sword in 1 minute.

- While attuned to the weapon, the sword's wielder can use the sword to cast the [[crusader's mantle]]  spell. Once used, this property of the sword can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
