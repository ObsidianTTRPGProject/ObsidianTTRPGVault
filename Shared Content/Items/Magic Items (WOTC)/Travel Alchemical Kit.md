## Description

Also at rank 3, Head Office provides you with a travel alchemical kit—an uncommon magic item containing miniaturized versions of both [[alchemist's supplies]] and a [[poisoner's kit]] (glass vials, a mortar and pestle, chemicals, and a glass stirring rod). You gain proficiency with a [[poisoner's kit]] as part of this upgrade.

You can use this magical kit as long as it is on your person, with no need to draw or stow it. If you are ever searched, finding your travel alchemical kit requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) or Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check.
