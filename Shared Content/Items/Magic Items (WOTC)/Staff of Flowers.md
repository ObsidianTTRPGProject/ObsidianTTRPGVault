# Staff of Flowers

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** common

**Weight**: 4 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d6 bludgeoning versatile (1d8)

## Description

This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of you, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mildscented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would. The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.
