# Nether Scroll of Azumar

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Spell Scroll

**Rarity:** legendary

## Description

Unlike most scrolls, a Nether Scroll of Azumar is not a consumable magic item. It takes 30 days of concentrated study—at least 8 hours per day—to attempt to understand this scroll. After completing this study, you must make a DC 25 Intelligence ([[Arcana]]) check. If this check fails, you take `dice: 16d10` psychic damage, and you can attempt the check again after another 30 days of concentrated study.

When you succeed on the check, you gain the following benefits:

- Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. Once you gain this benefit, you can't use this scroll to increase your Intelligence again.

- You gain advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

When you gain the scroll's benefits, a [[stone golem]]  magically appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you and acts as your ally. If you die, the golem turns to dust.
