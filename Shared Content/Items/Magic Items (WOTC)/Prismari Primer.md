# Prismari Primer

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** uncommon

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a spellcaster

## Description

The Prismari Primer is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Prismari College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. If you make a Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) or a Charisma ([[Performance]]) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself a `dice: 1d4` bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the `dice: d20`.

In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the bard or sorcerer spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
