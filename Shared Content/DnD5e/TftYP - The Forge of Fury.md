# Preface
Welcome to *Tales from the Yawning Portal*. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.

Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.

- A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.
- A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.
- A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.

These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerûn and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.

The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.

### Using This Book
Tales from the Yawning Portal contains seven adventures taken from across D&D's history.

The introduction of each adventure provides ideas on adapting it to a variety of D&D settings. Use that information to place it in your campaign or to give you an idea of how to adapt it.

These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as *Storm King's Thunder*, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.

### About the Adventures

#### The Sunless Citadel
*The Sunless Citadel,* written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.

Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Citadel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. It's also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.

#### The Forge of Fury
*The Forge of Fury,* written by Richard Baker, was published in 2000 shortly after The Sunless Citadel. Characters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a ruined dwarven fortress.

Like its predecessor, *The Forge of Fury* is tailored to provide increasingly tougher threats as the characters make their way through the fortress. Those who survive the experience can expect to advance to 5th level-seasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory and renown.

#### The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan
*The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,* written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title *Lost Tamoachan* at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.

The updated version of the adventure presented herein is designed for a group of four or five 5th-level player characters.

#### White Plume Mountain
Lawrence Schick, the author of *White Plume Mountain*, related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he get the job, but *White Plume* became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.

The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.

#### Dead in Thay
*Dead in Thay,* written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was created when the fifth edition D&D game was in the testing stages. In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to *Tomb of Horrors, Ruins of Undermountain*, and other "killer dungeons" throughout the history of the game.

The version of *Dead in Thay* presented here is modified for use in home campaigns. It is designed for characters of 9th to 11th level.

#### Against the Giants
The three linked adventures that make up *Against the Giants* were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the *Player's Handbook* for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.

The compilation of *Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl*, and *Hall of the Fire Giant King* was published in 1981 as *Against the Giants*. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.

#### Tomb of Horrors
Before there was much of anything else in the world of the D&D game, there was the *Tomb of Horrors*.

The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of *Tomb of Horrors*, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.

As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.

### Running the Adventures
To run each of these adventures, you need the fifth edition *Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*. Before you sit down with your players, read the text of the adventure all the way through and familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps making notes about complex areas or places where the characters are certain to go, so you're well prepared before the action starts.

>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.
>

The *Monster Manual* contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in appendix B. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure's text tells you so.

Spells and nonmagical objects or equipment mentioned in the book are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, unless the adventure's text directs you to an item's description in appendix A.

### Creating a Campaign
While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaign-over 30 years separates the newest from the oldest-they have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.

Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.

The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.

### The Yawning Portal
Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.

In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.

For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.

All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.

Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.

Adventurers from across Faerûn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.

> ##### The Green Dragon Inn
>The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.
>

### Features of the Yawning Portal
The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The "well" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.

Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.

#### Entering the Well
Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to "ride the rope") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.

#### Oddities on Display
A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.

##### Yawning Portal Taproom Curios

#### A Typical Evening
On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.

Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.

### Starting the Story
Kicking off a dungeon adventure can be as simple as having a mysterious stranger offer the characters a quest while they are at the Yawning Portal (or some other tavern). This approach is a cliché, but it is an effective one. Use the following two tables to generate a couple of details, then tailor the particulars of the quest and the quest giver to suit the adventure you plan to run.

##### Mysterious Stranger Quest
| d8 | Objective |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Recover a particular item |
| 2 | Find and return with an NPC or monster |
| 3 | Slay a terrible monster or NPC |
| 4 | Guard a person while they perform a ritual |
| 5 | Create an accurate map of part of the dungeon |
| 6 | Discover secret lore hidden in the dungeon |
| 7 | Destroy an object |
| 8 | Sanctify part of the dungeon to a god of good |

##### Mysterious Stranger Secret
| d8 | Secret |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Intends to betray the party |
| 2 | Unwittingly provides false information |
| 3 | Has a secret agenda (roll another quest) |
| 4 | Is a devil in disguise |
| 5 | Has led other parties to their doom |
| 6 | Is the charmed thrall of a mind flayer |
| 7 | Is possessed by a ghost |
| 8 | Is a solar in disguise |

#### Durnan
The proprietor of the Yawning Portal is something of an enigma. Blessed with a seemingly limitless life span by treasures he brought back from his expedition nearly two centuries ago, he is as much a fixture in the tap room as the well.

Durnan is a man of few words. He expects to be paid for his time, and will offer insight and rumors only in return for hard cash. "We know the odds and take our chances," he says, whether he is breaking up a card game that has turned violent or refusing the pleas of adventurers trapped at the bottom of the well who are unable to pay for a ride up. Despite his stony heart, he is an excellent source of information about Undermountain and other dungeons, provided one can pay his price.

![[Durnan.jpg|right|300]]

***Personality Trait: Isolation.*** It's a cruel world. All people have to fend for themselves. Self-sufficiency is the only path to success.

***Ideal: Independence.*** Someone who can stand alone can stand against anything.

***Bond: The Yawning Portal.*** This place is my only home. My friends and family are long gone. I love this place, but I try not to get attached to the people here. I'll outlive them all. Lucky me.

***Flaw: Heartless.*** If you want sympathy, the Temple of Ilmater is in the Sea Ward. No matter how bad things are, you'll be gone in a blink of an eye.

#### Other Denizens
The Yawning Portal is host to a variety of regular visitors, most of whom offer services to adventurers. Chapter 4 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* provides plenty of resources for generating nonplayer characters. The following table provides some possibilities for why an individual is visiting the Yawning Portal.

##### Denizens
| d10 | Denizen |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Devotee of Tymora, encourages adventures to seek out quests, can cast bless |
| 2 | Bored, retired adventurer, claims to have explored dungeon of note and can describe first few areas (20 percent chance of an accurate description) |
| 3 | Heckler, mocks cowards and makes bets that adventurers won't return from an expedition |
| 4 | Con artist, selling fake treasure maps (but a 10 percent chance that a map is genuine) |
| 5 | Wizard's apprentice, carefully making exact sketches of various curios at her master's command |
| 6 | Spouse of a slain adventurer, who pays the toll for anyone wanting to exit Undermountain and plots against Durnan |
| 7 | Zhentarim agent, seeks rumors of treasure, tails any folk who return from Undermountain and notes their home base for future robbery |
| 8 | Agent of the Xanathar, ordered to "steal the hat worn by the eighth person to enter the taproom this night" |
| 9 | Magically preserved corpse in a coffin leaning against the bar; if asked about it, Durnan says, "He's waiting for someone," and nothing more |
| 10 | Elminster, incognito; 10 percent chance he is on an errand of cosmic importance; otherwise, he's pressing Durnan for gossip |

# The Forge of Fury
Two centuries ago, the great dwarf smith Durgeddin the Black and his clan were driven from their home by a horde of fierce orcs and trolls. They plundered the dwarves' ancestral halls and slew all they could catch. Fleeing his enemies, Durgeddin led the destitute remnants of his clan in search of a new home. After years of wandering, the dwarves discovered a great cavern system beneath the Stone Tooth: a rugged, forested hill crowned by a bare rocky crag. There Durgeddin and his followers founded the stronghold of Khundrukar.

About a century ago, a member of Durgeddin's clan was captured by a powerful orc tribe during a raid, and the orcs learned of their enemy's hidden stronghold. The orc chieftains raised a great army and marched on Khundrukar. In a hard-fought siege lasting months, the orcs tunneled around the dwarven defenses. When they finally stormed the place, they put all within to the sword, then carried off wagonloads of booty.

In the years since the great battle, various creatures have occupied the stronghold and used the place as a base for their raids. At other times, the caverns have lain empty except for the mindless and bloodthirsty monsters that haunt such places. Today legends of Durgeddin's Vengeance (or the Smith's War) and the extraordinary blades the dwarves forged in anger still surface from time to time in the lands near the Stone Tooth.

## Adventure Synopsis
*The Forge of Fury* is set in the ruined stronghold of Khundrukar. It is designed for four 3rd-level player characters. They can advance to 5th level with good play.

The characters come to the Stone Tooth in search of a reputed cache of Durgeddin's superior blades and find the stronghold inhabited by dangerous monsters. The complex consists of the following five sections:

- **The Mountain Door.** The Mountain Door comprises the uppermost level of the cavern complex. It is currently inhabited by a tribe of fierce orcs, led by a brutal ogre known as **Great Ulfe**.
- **The Glitterhame.** The largest level of Khundrukar, the Glitterhame is an expanse of beautiful natural caverns now infested by troglodytes and other cave-dwelling monsters.
- **The Sinkhole.** Streams in the Glitterhame descend to an underground river, which runs through a corner of the caverns forgotten by the denizens above.
- **The Foundry.** Beyond the Glitterhame lies a complex of chambers and passageways carved by Durgeddin's folk. A small band of duergar (gray dwarves) currently hold Durgeddin's hall, working to uncover the secrets of the smith's ancient forge. A great crevasse drops to the Black Lake.
- **The Black Lake.** The most dangerous denizen of the caverns under the Stone Tooth lairs in the cold, still waters of the Black Lake. Nightscale, a young black dragon, discovered a passage into the lake through an underwater siphon connecting to a mere on the far side of the hill. The dragon has claimed the ancient wealth of Khundrukar as her hoard.

## Character Hooks
You can place the Stone Tooth and its caverns anywhere you like in your campaign world. *The Forge of Fury* works well if you pick a remote range of rugged hills or highlands several days from the nearest community.

The town of Blasingdell is briefly described in this adventure, if you need a location where the characters can make their final preparations.

Your next task is to decide how the party learned about Khundrukar. Pick one of the following options that suits your campaign, or make up an explanation.

### Follow the Map
The party has acquired a map showing the location of a secret dwarven stronghold named Khundrukar. Perhaps the characters discovered the map and other lore about the place during a previous adventure, or it turned up in a forgotten corner of a library. Tales attributed to a previous, failed expedition make reference to a hoard of wondrous arms and armor.

> ##### Placing the Adventure
>Any setting that includes a mountainous region has a ready-to-use location for the dwarven stronghold in *The Forge of Fury*.
>
>***Dragonlance.*** On Krynn, Khundrukar can be placed anywhere in the Kharolis Mountains. An independent stronghold that has no direct tunnels connecting it to Thorbardin, it was overrun by attackers during the Age of Might. During the Age of Despair, it was seized by Highlord Verminaard's forces. Consider replacing the orcs in the adventure with hobgoblins and the duergar with Theiwar dwarves.

>***Eberron.*** Once an outpost in the western Mror Holds, Khundrukar was besieged and cleared of its inhabitants when the Kingdom of Galifar invaded that land. The aggressors left the place unoccupied after their victory. Since then, it has fallen into the hands of various groups of monsters.

>***Forgotten Realms.*** Located northwest of Mirabar in the Spine of the World, Khundrukar was a shield dwarf stronghold that became overrun by renegade orcs from the Many-Arrows tribe, unhappy with what they saw as their kingdom's betrayal of the old ways.

>***Greyhawk.*** Khundrukar stands in the Pomarj, in the western Drachensgrab Hills. The fortress fell shortly after the Hateful Wars, when a wave of orcs and other evil humanoid invaders swept over the region.

### Track the Broken Blade
Baron Althon, a local noble, hires the party to search for the legendary cache of weapons forged by Durgeddin the smith. He shows the characters a broken blade bearing the smith's mark, and tells them that it was discovered near a rocky hill called the Stone Tooth. Baron Althon provides directions and promises to reward the characters richly for each of Durgeddin's blades they recover. He will pay the characters 20 gp each just for bringing back information about the dwarven complex, and an additional 100 gp if they provide detailed maps.

### Vanquish the Orc Raiders
In the mining town of Blasingdell, the characters learn that orc raiders have been pillaging isolated farmsteads and camps in the hills north of the town. The local militia captured an orc warrior left for dead by its comrades and brought it back for questioning. Under the influence of a *charm person* spell, the orc divulged the location of the monsters' lair, a lonely hill called the Stone Tooth. The mayor offers a bounty of 25 gp per orc, dead or alive, and the gratitude of the townsfolk to any who can permanently end the threat.

> ##### The Mining Town of Blasingdell
>Blasingdell lies about 30 miles south of the Stone Tooth, a journey of three days on foot or two days on horseback due to the surrounding rugged terrain and dense forests. Although it isn't close enough for the characters to use as an overnight rest stop while they explore Khundrukar, Blasingdell is still useful as a place to purchase equipment, stock up on supplies, and train between excursions into the caverns.
>
>The town's population of around 2,000 is quite diverse; although humans are the largest group, almost any player character race can be found here.
>
>The town's mayor is **Sir Miles Berrick** (male human **noble**).
>
>**Sergeant Grendar Kuln** (male half-orc **veteran**) is in charge of the town watch; **Constable Dara Whitewood** (female human **veteran**) is the senior officer. The town watch consists of two full-time guards in addition to its officers. A militia force of around 100 commoners can be mustered in emergencies.
>
>**Kheldegan Tolm** (male dwarf **commoner**) owns Tolm's Superior Outfitting and Dry Goods.
>
>**Sarel Bankdown** (female half-elf **commoner**) is the proprietor of the Griffon's Nest inn and tavern.
>
>**Sister Alonsa** (female human **priest**) heads up the town's small temple (its primary deity is left to you). Sister Alonsa is assisted in her duties by two **acolytes**.
>

## Approaching Khundrukar
At the start of play, the characters are trekking through the wilderness and have just reached the outskirts of Blasingdell (or some other community), When you're ready to begin, read:

>>Durgeddin was a master smith who forged blades of surpassing quality and power. Centuries ago, his home was sacked by orcs. Durgeddin led the remnants of his clan to the mountains north of the town of Blasingdell and established a small, secret stronghold somewhere in the trackless wilderness.
>>
>>From his hidden redoubt, he waged a decades-long vendetta against all orc-kind, until his enemies discovered his fortress and attacked it after a long siege. Durgeddin and his followers perished, and much wealth was carried away by the conquering hordes. But it's said that the deepest and best-hidden vaults and armories escaped the looting, and that some of Durgeddin's extraordinary blades still wait in the darkness for a hand bold enough to claim one.
>>
>>You've come to Blasingdell, a small mining town on the northern frontier, to see if there's anything to these stories. Your map shows that the old dwarf-hold lies about three days' march to the north of the town. Dark, deeply forested hills rise beyond the town's outskirts
>>

The characters can spend time interacting with the townsfolk, gathering equipment and provisions, and otherwise preparing before they set out.

### The Stone Tooth
When the characters set forth on their journey, read:

>>As you travel north from the mining town of Blasingdell, you pass through brooding pine forests and deep vales. From where you stand now, you catch sight of a tall, steep hill that rises to a prominent bare knob of rock—the Stone Tooth. A thin spire of smoke rises from some unseen point high on the hill's slopes, and you can make out a steep, narrow road or track that runs back and forth across the face of the mountainside.
>>

Refer to map 2.1. The characters have several options: follow the path, scout the area, or wait and watch.

#### Follow the Path
At the foot of the Stone Tooth, a carefully constructed path winds up the hillside to some unseen height above. Durgeddin's clan concealed its presence as much as possible, but years of wind and rain have eroded away its cover, leaving the path exposed and visible from the valley floor below.

The path climbs to the Mountain Door, at the location marked A on the map. This is the route used by the orcs in **Great Ulfe**'s tribe to come and go from their lair.

If someone checks the path for tracks, a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that four booted humanoids came down it within the last day and headed into the forest. The trail joins older tracks in the woods and becomes indistinguishable after about half a mile. These tracks belong to orc foraging parties; see "*Wait and Watch*" below for more information.

![[002-map-2-1-the-stone-tooth.webp|right|300]]
#### Scout the Area
Ambitious characters might choose to ignore the path and scale the Stone Tooth's slopes. The going is very hard, with steep slopes and heavy undergrowth, reducing the characters' travel pace to roughly 100 feet per minute. Thoroughly exploring the hillside could easily take hours.

Heavy woods block the view upslope, making it difficult to ascertain the origin of the smoke (a natural chimney). Have the party's guide make a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check when the group first enters the hillside. On a successful check, the characters travel in the general direction of the chimney. Otherwise, they lose their way (see "*Becoming Lost*" in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

***(A) The Mountain Door.*** This is the front entrance to the Glitterhame. The old dwarf-path leads up to a bare shoulder of rock and then turns into a deep cleft in the hillside. If the characters enter this way, the expedition begins in *area 1* of *map 2.2*, the Mountain Door.

***(B) Chimney.*** When the characters reach the area marked B on the map, they can discover the source of the smoke. A natural rock chimney leads down into the caverns below, and a thin stream of smoke rises through it. The smoke spreads out and isn't easy to pinpoint in the rugged terrain.

A character who searches for the source of the smoke finds the rock chimney with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the characters pass nearby without searching, anyone who has a passive Perception score of 15 or higher notices the fissure.

If the characters descend the chimney, the expedition begins in *area 7* of *map 2.2*, the Mountain Door.

***(C) Orc Tunnel.*** On the other side of the Stone Tooth, a few hundred yards from the Mountain Door, the orc army burrowed into the hillside to circumvent the dwarven defenses. The tunnel is still passable, but its entrance is choked with brush and debris. If the characters enter this area, someone who has a passive Perception score of 15 or higher discovers the orc tunnel. The characters locate the tunnel automatically if anyone searches the area; it leads to *area 21* of *map 2.3*, the Glitterhame.

The tunnel entrance is about 6 feet high and 4 feet wide. Anyone who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check can spot old tracks passing in and out of the tunnel—reptilian footprints (from the **troglodytes** inhabiting the Glitterhame) and the paw prints of a very large **bear**.

***(D) Hilltop.*** An hour or two of hard hiking brings the party to the summit. The Stone Tooth is about 1,450 feet in height, towering over the neighboring hills by 500 feet or more. The last 100 feet or so are a sheer point of rock, requiring DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks to climb successfully. The view is spectacular, but the hilltop is otherwise unremarkable. (No entrance to the fortress is to be found here.)

***(E) The Dark Mere.*** The eastern slopes of the Stone Tooth descend into a damp valley where water is trapped by the terrain. A dark tarn pools under the hill's slopes, surrounded by numerous smaller lakes. A hidden drainage channel deep underwater connects to the subterranean Black Lake, providing access to Nightscale's underground lair.

The opening is about 40 feet down, and it lies about 100 feet from the western lakeshore. Player characters exploring around the lake can't find this outlet unless they conduct extensive dives to plumb the mere's depths, requiring DC 10 Strength (Athletics) checks to swim underwater. If any characters are capable of staying this deep without suffocating and conduct a thorough search of the lake, they discover the passage with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the characters enter through this watery passage, they emerge in *area 54* of *map 2.6*, the Black Lake.

> ##### Wilderness Encounters and Camping
>If you want to make the trek from Blasingdell to the Stone Tooth more interesting, you can create random encounters with orc raiding parties (see "Wait and Watch" below) or with creatures native to forest or hills. See *appendix B* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for lists of monsters by environment.
>
>The characters might be forced to retreat outside the stronghold to recuperate after difficult battles. The party can readily find defensible campsites in the forest near the Stone Tooth.
>

#### Wait and Watch
The characters might choose to observe the path for some time before braving the Stone Tooth. When they arrive, two foraging parties from **Great Ulfe**'s tribe are searching the nearby hills for loot. The first party of four **orcs** returns two days after the characters arrive, and the second group three days after that. These orcs sleep by day and travel by night, so they arrive in the party's vicinity just before dawn.

If the party sets up camp at least 90 feet from the path and doesn't take any action that might draw attention, the returning orcs pass by without spotting the campsite. Otherwise, the orcs notice the camp when they come within 90 feet (or within twice as far if a campfire is burning or the party isn't attempting to be quiet).

A lookout whose post overlooks the trail and who has a passive Perception score of 10 or higher detects the orcs as they approach. The orcs aren't likely to notice a hidden lookout; compare their passive Perception scores to the character's Dexterity (Stealth) check.

>>Four hunched humanoids in dirty hide armor approach along the trail, snarling and muttering to each other in a guttural tongue. Yellow tusks jut from their bestial faces.
>>

If the orcs come across the camp and aren't spotted, they attempt to take out anyone on watch or creep into the camp to attack sleeping characters.

If an orc party moves past the characters unchallenged or fights its way through, the survivors reinforce the defenses in the complex (see *area 5* and *area 14*).

Captured orcs can describe in some detail the general arrangement of the Mountain Door. They don't know anything about the rest of the complex, or that it's possible to enter through the chimney. The orcs defending the Mountain Door refuse to negotiate for their return.

The characters might disguise themselves as orcs using captured gear. Doing so can let them try to bluff their way past sentries in the dungeon, using Charisma (Deception) checks contested by the orcs' Wisdom (Insight) checks.

***Treasure.*** Each orc carries a sack of mundane supplies looted from the countryside, as well as coinage totaling 4d6 sp and 1d4 gp.

***Development.*** No more dungeon denizens emerge from the dungeon during this time, and no more orcs leave for a week after the second patrol returns.

> ##### Khundrukar: General Features
>The following aspects of Khundrukar are true unless otherwise noted in a particular area description.
>
>***Doors.*** Most doors are made of wood or stone. Characters can attempt various tasks before trying to open a door, including listening for sounds from the other side and checking for traps. If characters elect to listen at a door, check the description of the room beyond to determine if any creatures inhabit that area. If no instructions are otherwise provided, a character who listens at a door and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can hear sounds of activity through the door; increase the DC to 15 for quieter sounds.

>***Light.*** Within the confines of Khundrukar, all areas are dark unless a room's description says otherwise.

>***Ventilation.*** All keyed areas contain an adequate air supply. The air is renewed through vents that lead to the surface. These vents are individually too small for any but Tiny creatures to navigate.

## The Forge of Fury
Once the party enters Khundrukar, start at the appropriate area on *map 2.2*, the Mountain Door, or *map 2.3*, the Glitterhame.

## The Mountain Door
The uppermost level of Khundrukar, called the Mountain Door, is a natural cavern that was expanded and improved upon by Durgeddin's folk, who created a series of halls and guard chambers that protect the entrance to their realm. The place is still well fortified, even to this day.

This former dwarven strongpoint is now occupied by a band of orc raiders, led by a fierce ogre who calls himself **Great Ulfe**. These raiders emerge from the Mountain Door to hunt and pillage in the surrounding area. To keep their lair secure, the orcs have blocked access to the lower levels of Khundrukar, and they rarely encounter the other denizens of the cave system.

![[004-the-mountaind-door-map-pc.webp|right|300]](Player Version)The following locations are identified on map 2.2.

### 1. End of the Trail
The old dwarven path ascends to a cleft in the hillside and ends at the front door of Khundrukar.

>>The path climbs up one last steep switchback toward a bare shoulder of rock. The hillside rises steeply on your right and drops away precipitously on your left. Debris and rubbish lie scattered over the last hundred yards or so—discarded water skins, bits of charred bone, and splintered casks or kegs. Up ahead, the path opens onto a wide ledge and then doubles back sharply into the mountainside.
>>
>>Two bestial humanoids in hide armor stand watch on the ledge. They appear inattentive and bored.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **orcs** stand guard along the northern edge of the ledge, though they aren't paying as much attention to their duties as they should. The characters (or their advance scout) can spot them from as far as 60 feet away. The sentries, Wark and Thark, are grumbling in the Orc language about someone named Ulfe. Apply a −2 penalty to the orcs' passive Perception scores.

***Arrow Slits.*** When the characters move around the corner into the eastern part of the ledge, they might discover a row of hidden arrow slits in the rocky wall to the east about 15 feet above the floor. By examining the wall and making a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices the slits.

***Developments.*** If they are attacked or confronted by more than one character, Wark and Thark call out a warning that's heard by the orc in *area 4* and then attempt to flee to *area 3*. See the "Mountain Door Defenses" sidebar.

If the archers are alerted to the party's presence, they open fire on intruders on the ledge and in area 2. See area 4 for more information.

> ##### Mountain Door Defenses
>The orcs are well prepared for a frontal assault on the Mountain Door. They follow the sequence of activity described below to the best of their ability unless prevented or interrupted by the player characters.
>
>***Round 1.*** After sounding the alarm, the sentries in area 1 (Wark and Thark) flee south to area 2.

>***Round 2.*** The orcs in area 4 fire at any exposed characters in area 1 if they have been alerted by the sentries. Wark and Thark flee through the door into area 3.

>***Round 3.*** Wark and Thark cross the rope bridge in area 3. The orcs in area 4 continue to fire at characters in areas 1 and 2. One orc from area 4 moves through the secret door leading to area 3, intending to close and bar the double doors leading to area 2.

>***Round 4.*** Wark and Thark slip through to *area 5* to spread the alarm, alerting the orcs in *areas 11* and *14*.

>***Round 5.*** The orc that shut the double doors in area 3 moves to area 4 or 4a while the other archers continue to fire at exposed characters. The orcs in the eastern half of area 3 cut the rope bridge and prepare to defend the doors that lead to area 5.

>***Round 8.*** The orcs in area 14 arrive in area 5.

>***Round 12.*** **Great Ulfe** and the orcs from area 11 move to area 5 to ready a counterattack.

### 2. The Dwarf-Door
Moving eastward from the ledge, the trail turns south and rises steeply through a cleft in the rock toward a grand entrance.

>>Shallow steps lead up through a steep fissure to the south and turn east into the mountainside. Here, a broad entranceway has been carved out of the stone. Marble steps cracked with age and veined with green moss lead up to a strong double door of carved stone, eight feet wide and almost ten feet tall. Arrow slits high on the north and south walls command this area.
>>

If the characters quietly dealt with the orcs in area 1 using stealth or disguise, the door is open. Otherwise, the orcs have been alerted to intruders, and the door is shut and barred from the inside. Forcing open the barred door is very difficult, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check.

***Creatures.*** If the orcs have been alerted, the orcs in *areas 4 and 4a* fire arrows until the characters either retreat or succeed in bypassing the door.

***Development.*** If the characters are repelled, they must deal with additional reinforcements if they try this approach again. Two orcs from *area 11* stand watch at the doors on the west side of area 3, while the **orc Eye of Gruumsh** from *area 9* backs up the orcs in area 4 or 4a.

![[003-totyp-02-04.webp|right|300]]

### 3. The Rift Hall

>>The great door opens into a large hall. A narrow ledge overlooks a deep, dark crevasse that cuts the room in two. A dangerous-looking rope bridge, frayed and thin, spans the gap. Water gurgles and rushes somewhere far below. Two copper braziers burn brightly on either side of the door, illuminating the western half of the room. Another ledge is barely visible on the other side of the chasm.
>>

The hall beyond the doors, and the great crevasse that runs through it, once served as the last line of defense for Khundrukar's dwarves.

***Creatures.*** Two **orcs** guard the eastern side of the room. They do everything in their power to prevent the characters from getting across the bridge. If any of the party members have darkvision or a means of illuminating the far side, read:

>>Two brutish humanoids stand watch on the other side of the crevasse. They snarl a challenge, revealing yellowed tusks, and prepare to hurl javelins at you!
>>

***Rope Bridge.*** The bridge is safe structurally, despite its appearance. Crossing under fire is difficult enough to require DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. On a successful check, a character can move at half speed. On a failed check, a character makes no progress. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character must make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the character plummets almost 200 feet to the underground river below and is swept away. The characters can prevent falls by roping themselves to a stable attachment point before crossing.

***Secret Doors.*** Two secret doors on the north and south walls lead to areas 4 and 4a. The doors are well made, each requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to discover. A door can be opened by simultaneously pushing in two concealed stone plates in the wall about 1 foot above it. The plates can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Developments.*** The orcs use the rock outcroppings on their side for shelter from attacks, gaining half cover. They throw their javelins at characters trying to cross the bridge, or at those who hang back to cast spells or make ranged attacks. A character on the bridge who is hit by an attack must make a saving throw to avoid a fall, just as if the character's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to move along the bridge had failed by 5 or more.

If an intruder gets at least two-thirds of the way across the bridge, one orc breaks cover to move through the double doors into *area 5* and get help. The other tries to hinder the characters by chopping at the bridge's support ropes with its greataxe. Each rope has 8 hit points and AC 11. If one support rope is cut, the DC of the Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cross the bridge increases to 12, and characters on the bridge must immediately make a saving throw to avoid falling as described above. If both ropes are cut, the east end of the bridge drops into the crevasse and slams into the cliff wall on the west side. Any characters on the bridge take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the impact with the wall and must make successful DC 12 Strength or Dexterity saving throws to avoid losing their grip and falling if they aren't otherwise secured.

***Development.*** If the orcs destroy the bridge but repel the invaders in doing so, **Great Ulfe**'s followers rebuild it within three days. Any orcs killed here are replaced by orcs from *area 11*.

### 4 and 4a. Archers' Stations
The dwarves carved out chambers on either side of the entryway so they could rain arrows down on attackers that approached the front door of their stronghold. The arrow slits are 15 feet or more above the floor of *areas 1* and *2* and are impassible for creatures larger than Tiny. They grant three-quarters cover to the orcs stationed behind them.

The secret doors in area 3 provide access to these locations.

>>The door slides aside to reveal a narrow passage that descends a flight of stairs into a small chamber. Light from outside slants into the room through a series of narrow embrasures.
>>
>>The area is littered with well-gnawed bones, cobwebs, and rat droppings. Poorly cured hide blankets are carelessly scattered over the floor.
>>

***Secret Door.*** In the north end of area 4, a secret door connects to *area 14*. A character can find the door by succeeding on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. The orcs are unaware of this passage and don't use it.

***Creatures.*** Four **orcs**, three in area 4 and one in area 4a, overlook the stairs leading up to area 2. These orcs aren't particularly vigilant, but they do start shooting if the sentries in area 1 call for help. The orcs are armed with longbows instead of javelins: +3 to hit (range 150/600 ft.); 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage on a hit.

When the characters turn the corner into area 2, the archer in area 4a joins the attack while one of the archers from area 4 circles around through the secret door in an attempt to shut the double doors to *area 3* (see "*Mountain Door Defenses*" above).

If the heroes attack by coming through the secret doors that lead to these areas, the archers fire at characters descending the stairs, then switch to greataxes and move up to block the stairways.

***Development.*** If the characters dispose of the sentries in area 1 quietly, the orcs in area 4 might not notice them. Characters can attempt to sneak past the row of arrow slits by comparing their Dexterity (Stealth) checks to the orcs' passive Perception scores. If the characters successfully sneak past the sentries, they reach area 2 without alerting the archers.

If the characters defeat these orcs but withdraw from the dungeon before overcoming the rest of them, the archers are replaced by orcs from *area 14* and reinforced by the **orc eye of Gruumsh** from *area 9*.

### 5. Orc Cave

>>The walls and floor of this natural cave have been carefully smoothed. You can discern at least four routes leading off into darkness. Red coals glow from within the southeastern passageway, and a crude wooden cage door closes off the southern exit. The floor is covered with sleeping furs, crates, sacks, and rubbish.
>>

The second orc raiding party normally lairs in the open area east of the doors. These orcs are currently out of the dungeon unless the party spent several days observing the hillside (see "*Wait and Watch*" above) before entering.

***Cage Door.*** The cage door to the south leads to area 6, where two prisoners languish under the orcs' indifferent care. The prisoners leap to their feet and rush to the cage door to cry for help when the characters enter area 5.

***Treasure.*** The crates and sacks in this room contain mundane supplies looted from the countryside—flour, grain, nails, and so on. The total value is about 20 gp for about 500 pounds of material. Additionally, if characters are held captive in area 6, their equipment is stored here.

***Development.*** When the second orc raiding party returns (five days after the characters arrive at the Stone Tooth), they take up residence here. Add four **orcs** to this room after their return.

### 6. Prisoner Cave
The orcs occasionally capture miners, settlers, and merchants traveling through the forests north of Blasingdell. They keep their captives in a small pen until they put them to death or ransom them.

>>A row of rough-hewn sapling trunks forms a crude but serviceable barrier across the mouth of this small cave. A door locked with an iron padlock secures the room. Inside, you see two filthy prisoners dressed in tattered rags, crowding close to the door. "Thank Yondalla!" one cries out. "We're rescued!"
>>

***Creatures.*** The prisoners are a pair of human **commoners** named Geradil and Courana. They hail from a small settlement a few miles from Blasingdell, and the orcs have held them captive for almost a month now. Neither one's family could raise the ransom demanded by their captors, so both await a terrible death at the orcs' hands.

Opening the cage door requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, the key from Old Yarrack's pocket (see *area 14*), or a sharp axe and a little time. (The padlock has AC 19 and 5 hit points.) Geradil and Courana are extremely grateful for their rescue, but they will not join the characters in their quest—neither is skilled at fighting, and they just want to go home.

***Treasure.*** The characters can free the prisoners and escort them back to their homes (about a day's travel away). The grateful families reward them with two *potions of healing*. Taking the time to see Geradil and Courana to safety, however, gives the orcs a chance to prepare for the next assault.

***Development.*** Any characters captured by the orcs eventually wind up in the cage, unless they demonstrate that they're too much trouble to be left alive. Their gear is stored among the other supplies in *area 5*. New characters joining the party might also be introduced as prisoners here.

### 7. Fire in the Hole
The irregular chamber southeast of the main cave holds the main cooking fire of the tribe. A crevice in its ceiling winds up through the rock to the natural chimney on the hilltop above (see "*The Stone Tooth*" above).

>>A large, smoky fire crackles in the center of this room. Battered pots and kettles are stacked all over; clearly, this space serves as a crude kitchen. You feel a distinct draft drawing the smoke up through a rough hole in the ceiling.
>>

The characters might attempt to descend into the area through the chimney. The shaft is about 80 feet long; its walls are irregular and rough but slippery, requiring successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks to climb. Anchoring a rope at the top of the shaft reduces the check DC to 5. A careful climber can easily avoid the fire on the way down.

If a character's check fails by 5 or more, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or fall the rest of the way down the chimney. In addition to falling damage, the character takes an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage from the hot coals and makes enough noise to alert any orcs in area 5.

### 8. Orc Commons

>>Haphazard stacks of crates, barrels, sacks, and bundles crowd this long cavern. To the north, two finished stone passageways open to the east and west; a narrower opening leads south. In the southeast corner is an old well full of murky water.
>>

The cavern is full of plunder from the orcs' raids through the surrounding area: foodstuffs, ale, blankets, tools, timber, pitch, nails, wool, and similar goods.

***Iron Gate.*** The passage leading east is blocked about 10 feet in by tightly packed crates and sacks of flour. Removing this material allows travel for another 20 feet to the east, where the tunnel ends at an iron gate stuffed with blankets and straw pallets. The orcs created these barricades to prevent the stirges in *area 10* from getting out.

The iron gate's lock is rusted shut; it can be picked with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character using thieves' tools or forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

***Secret Doors.*** The passage to the south branches in a Y shape. The southwest branch connects to *area 5*, and the southeast one leads to a secret door cleverly constructed to blend into the natural rock of the cave. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers the door.

On the other side, a worked passage continues up to what appears to be a blank wall, marked with hexes and curses in Orc. The markings conceal another secret door, which requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.

***Treasure.*** The mundane supplies have a total value of about 20 gp for about 500 pounds of material.

With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character finds a loose stone. Behind it is hidden a small locked strongbox containing 180 gp and a *flask of holy water*. This is the personal treasure of Old Yarrack (see *area 11*).

### 9. Shaman's Lair

>>The secret door pivots open to reveal a chamber of finished stonework. The room is cluttered with crude furnishings, and the air is hazy with the smoke of a small cooking fire. Dozens of yellowed skulls are suspended from the ceiling by fraying ropes strung through holes punched in the bone. An orc in a ragged black robe looks up from her work, her face twisted in an expression of rage.
>>

***Creatures.*** Burdug the shaman, an **orc Eye of Gruumsh**, has commandeered a chamber as her private domain. She lives here with her two followers, female **orcs**, separate from the rest of the tribe.

The door to area 10 is locked, but the key is inserted in the keyhole on this side. Burdug keeps the door closed because she wants to confine the stirges on the other side. (She calls the stirges her "little stingies" and occasionally captures one to use in her potions and brews.)

Burdug orders her two followers to engage intruders while she attempts to neutralize a dangerous-looking combatant with a *command* spell. Then she casts *bless* on herself and the others, and finally casts *spiritual weapon* before joining battle.

If the fight goes poorly, Burdug throws *alchemist's fire* (she has three flasks) and opens the door to area 10, releasing the **stirges**. She takes advantage of the confusion, using more alchemist's fire if necessary, to escape and seek help.

***Treasure.*** A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds two leather sacks among the clutter, each containing 160 sp. If Burdug is defeated, the characters can recover any of her three flasks of *alchemist's fire* that weren't used.

***Secret Exit.*** A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check is required to find the secret door on the west wall. It connects to the passage leading toward area 8; the secret door farther along the passage to the west isn't concealed from this side.

### 10. The Grand Stair

>>The ceiling soars thirty feet high in the center of this impressive chamber, and the walls are carved with images of dwarves at their forges. Two large stone doors exit to the north and south. Several old skeletons lie scattered near the northern door. A gate of wrought iron stands in the western wall.
>>
>>In the center of the floor, a natural rift descends sharply. Dozens of stone steps lead down into darkness. You can hear the distant sound of running water and a curious buzzing coming from far below.
>>

The easternmost chamber in the Mountain Door complex formerly served as the main entrance to the Glitterhame, which occupies the great natural caverns deeper in the hillside.

***Creatures.*** If the characters aren't trying to be quiet, four hungry **stirges** attack.

>>The buzzing grows louder, and then four things resembling insectoid bats emerge from the stairwell and fly toward you!
>>

Large quantities of smoke discourage the stirges, and they don't move closer than 5 feet from a source of fire (including characters set alight by the trap described below). Sated stirges flap off to digest their meal down in *area 15a* of the Glitterhame.

The iron gate blocks entry from *area 8* (see it for more information). The stairs in the rift lead down to the northwest end of *area 15* in the Glitterhame.

The door to the south connects to area 9 and is locked from the other side. The lock can be picked from this side by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, but doing so pushes the key out on the other side and warns Burdug the shaman that someone's coming.

***Fire Trap.*** The door to the north is carved in the image of a glowering dwarf's face. Hinges are visible. On either side of the door, eight small spouts are carefully worked into the stonework about 10 feet above the floor.

The skeletons near the door are those of orcs killed by the trap long ago; their remains show signs of severe scorching. Rusted axe heads lie near the bodies, with no sign of the weapons' hafts.

If the door is pulled open before the trap is disabled, a counterweight drops and pumps a flammable substance resembling alchemist's fire from the spouts. Each creature within 15 feet of the door takes 10 (4d4) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. At the start of each of its turns thereafter, an affected creature takes 5 (2d4) fire damage. A creature can fight the flames around itself by making a successful DC 10 Dexterity check as an action; a successful check reduces the fire damage it takes at the start of each of its turns to 2 (1d4). Making another successful Dexterity check as an action quenches the flames around the creature entirely.

After the door is opened, the counterweight pulls it shut again in 2 rounds, resetting the trap. The characters can prevent this from happening by jamming the door open. If the trap resets, it can be activated only once more before its fiery substance is depleted.

The spouts on the wall can be detected by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check afterward, a character deduces that they form part of a trap mechanism. A character who makes a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or someone who tightly plugs the holes with durable material, renders the trap inactive. Someone who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check while examining the door identifies the counterweight mechanism that activates the trap; it can be deactivated afterward by someone who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

***Development.*** Inspecting the small room behind the door reveals the full extent of the trap's counterweight mechanism, as well as a system of pipes that connect the spouts to two 20-gallon copper drums (containing the substance for the fire trap).

A character who is proficient in the use of alchemist's supplies might be able to craft alchemist's fire from the dregs of the tanks. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check after the character finishes a long rest. On a successful check, the character salvages 1d4 flasks of alchemist's fire. On a failed check, the reagents are mixed improperly, spoiling the batch; no further attempt to use these reagents can be made. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character is affected as though hit by *alchemist's fire*.

### 11. Orc Quarters

>>Barrels, crates, and sacks line the walls of this chamber. Among the loot, four oversized straw pallets and other simple furnishings show that it now serves as a bunk room. Four bestial humanoids with feral eyes are cleaning their weapons and mending their gear; they spring to their feet and roar in challenge.
>>

***Creatures.*** Four **orcs** live in an old guardroom. These orcs fight dirty. They team up into pairs, each focusing on one character. One orc in the pair attempts to shove the character, then the other attacks, hoping for a prone target.

***Treasure.*** The supplies stockpiled here are the same as those in *areas 5* and *8*: trade goods and staples raided from travelers and nearby settlements.

The orcs have 210 gp stashed in an old iron cauldron under vermin-infested bedding. A small pouch in another orc's bedding contains a topaz worth 200 gp and two onyx stones worth 50 gp each. This loot isn't well hidden; anyone searching the room can uncover it.

***Development.*** If the characters leave the complex before they have defeated **Great Ulfe**, two of these orcs move to reinforce *area 2* (reducing the number in this room to two) before the characters return.

![[004-totyp-02-05.webp|right|300]]

### 12. Great Ulfe

>>A short flight of stairs leads up to a large, iron-bound door. A bloodstained human skull is fixed to the center of the door by an iron spike.
>>

The door isn't locked, but it is heavy and hard to move; a successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to force it open.

>>Beyond the door lies a small chamber covered in poorly cured animal hides and illuminated by smoking torches in bronze sconces. The smell is indescribable. A monstrous creature about ten feet in height steps forward, a massive axe in one hand. Two huge wolves strain atchains held closely in its other hand. "You think to challenge the **Great Ulfe**?" the creature booms. "Vak! Thrag! At them!"
>>
>>It drops the chains and, as the wolves spring forward, it charges at you with a roar of rage.
>>

***Creatures.*** **Great Ulfe** is a fierce **ogre** who leads the orcs of the Mountain Door. The chamber he claims as his own once belonged to the dwarf watch-captain.

If the characters fail to open the door on the first attempt, **Great Ulfe** is alerted to their presence. He releases his two **dire wolves**, Vak and Thrag, and takes the Ready action to attack the first enemy who enters the room. He is armed with a greataxe instead of a greatclub: +6 to hit; 17 (2d12 + 4) slashing damage on a hit.

**Great Ulfe** neither asks nor gives quarter, but if the ogre falls, the wolves attempt to flee.

***Development.*** If the characters defeat **Great Ulfe** but leave any orcs alive, one of the surviving orcs claims leadership of the tribe. If at least half the orcs in the tribe are slain in addition to Ulfe, any survivors abandon the dungeon after the party leaves. They become roving bands of raiders that the adventurers might have to deal with later.

***Treasure.*** **Great Ulfe** keeps his hoard in two large wooden chests against the south wall: 440 gp, 1,600 sp, a *potion of climbing*, and a *+1 rapier*. (The ogre would never stoop to wielding the delicate blade like some prancing bard.)

### 13. Dwarven Statue

>>At the end of the passage stands a statue of a fierce-looking dwarf in heavy mail armor. The stone warrior holds a sword in one hand and a smith's hammer in the other. The statue is about seven feet tall and stands on a large stone pedestal.
>>

The statue is part of another trap designed to thwart invaders of the citadel. All the denizens of the Mountain Door know about the trap and avoid triggering it.

If any character approaches within 5 feet of the statue without disarming the trap, read:

>>Suddenly, you feel a small click from the floor beneath your feet. The statue's bearded face slides open, like an oversized nutcracker, and greenish gas billows forth.
>>

***Poison Gas Trap.*** A pressure plate is set into the floor about 5 feet in front of the statue. When at least 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, it depresses into the floor, opening the statue's face to reveal a nozzle from which poison gas sprays out in a 15-foot cone. Each affected creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the creature finishes a short rest.

Someone who examines the proper location and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the pressure plate. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a character using thieves' tools disarms the trap; the pressure plate can also be deactivated by physically jamming it so that it can't move.

If the trap isn't deactivated, it resets automatically after 1 minute.

### 14. Bunk Room
A large chamber, once the principal bunk room for dwarf guards posted in this part of the dungeon, has been appropriated by **Great Ulfe**'s orcs. Up to eleven of the creatures live here, but at the moment a group of them are out raiding the countryside nearby, and three others are on duty in *area 4*.

>>This chamber is filled with rough-hewn bunks, tables, and chairs, and the floor is strewn with filthy pelts. At first glance it appears that a dozen or so humanoids might use this area as a sleeping quarters.
>>

***Creatures.*** Only Old Yarrack the **orog** and four **orcs** are at home when the characters enter the chamber. They enter combat as soon as they're aware of intruders.

If the battle goes poorly for the orcs, Old Yarrack orders an orc to break off and summon help from *area 9*. If things get desperate, he sends for help from the orcs in *area 11*. If the orcs here fall, Yarrack attempts to join **Great Ulfe**'s forces in *area 12*. The orog carries a *potion of healing* and drinks it if his current hit points drop to one-fourth his hit point maximum or lower.

***Secret Door.*** The orcs don't know about the secret door in the western wall, but a character who searches the spot can discover it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Development.*** Two days after the characters arrive, the first raiding party returns and reinforces this room with four more orcs. Thus, the party might encounter as many as nine creatures in this room.

Any orcs slain in *area 4* are replaced by orcs from this room, if any survive.

***Treasure.*** A successful DC 10 Wisdom check reveals a loose stone on the south wall, concealing a sack that holds 250 sp and 40 gp. Aside from his *potion of healing*, Old Yarrack keeps his personal treasure in *area 8*.

Old Yarrack carries the key to the cage door in *area 6*.

## The Glitterhame
Below the Mountain Door lies the Glitterhame, a large series of natural caverns in the heart of the Stone Tooth. The caverns are beautiful: the walls sparkle and glisten with flecks of semiprecious stone, and millennia of sculpting and erosion by water have created sheets of fluted flowstone, delicate stalactites, and majestic stalagmites. Water streams down through the caverns toward an underground river far below.

![[005-totyp-02-06.webp|right|300]]

The Glitterhame is now home to a band of **troglodytes**, dangerous reptilian savages that haunt underground places. The troglodytes and **Great Ulfe**'s tribe maintain an uneasy peace, although skirmishes occur. The troglodytes usually use the old orc tunnel (see *area 21*) to hunt on the surface and leave the orcs alone. In return, **Great Ulfe**'s followers rarely invade the troglodytes' domain.

![[009-tfof02.webp|right|300]](Player Version)The following locations are identified on map 2.3.

> ##### Vision in the Glitterhame
>Range of vision is important in the characters' exploration of this level. Most light sources don't illuminate beyond 60 feet, and many of the chambers and passages in the Glitterhame are much larger than that. The darkness hides many perils.
>

### 15. The Cold Stream
If the characters take the steps down from *area 10*, they emerge into a narrow tunnel with a subterranean stream flowing across it.

>>The stairway twists and turns a long way downward. The floor has been cut into hundreds of shallow steps, but the walls and ceiling are still natural rock. About sixty feet down, a rushing stream spills from a narrow crack to the south and crosses the stairway, disappearing into a narrow, winding tunnel to the north. The rill is only two or three feet wide.
>>

If the characters explore the route taken by the stream, they have to go single file as they wade through the water. The bed of the fast-moving stream slants sharply; each character must make a successful DC 8 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to descend safely. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character falls, tumbling 20 feet downhill and taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

### 15a. Stirge Colony
***Creatures.*** Stirges have made their nest in a small cave overlooking the stream, about halfway down the passage. Fissures at the back of the cave run 150 feet to the surface, but nothing larger than a stirge can fit through. Six **stirges** are sleeping in the nest, but any noise or light from a party descending the streambed wakes them. Each round after the characters enter the cave, 1d4 stirges wake and attack, until all are active.

***Treasure.*** On the floor at the back of the stirge cave lies the desiccated corpse of a dwarf explorer who died here many years ago—part of the failed expedition. A leather pouch on its belt contains 35 gp.

### 16. High Cavern
The first chamber of the Glitterhame proper is bisected by the stream and has a number of routes leading away from it.

>>The descending fissure opens up abruptly into a very high cavern, its ceiling easily forty feet or more overhead. The stairway continues to wind down along a ledge that follows the north wall of the chamber. A fast-moving stream about five feet wide runs across the floor of the chamber from the north and disappears under a low stone overhang to the south, and larger passageways exit to the southeast and the northeast.
>>

***Creatures.*** Four **stirges** are clinging to the chamber walls high overhead. They can see any light source that is brought into this chamber, but they are very hard to spot in turn, owing to the height of the ceiling. The stirges have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide unless a character specifically looks for danger overhead, so they might surprise the party.

The stream exits the south wall of the cavern through a passage only 3 feet high, half filled by water, which serves as an entrance to the troglodytes' lair (area 17). Anyone who searches the stream's banks finds the footprints of Medium reptilian creatures and tracks left by tails with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check.

To reach area 17 from this cave, a Medium or larger character must crouch down and then wade or crawl through the stream. Torches and lanterns are difficult to keep lit, since the lowest point of the ceiling in this passage is only about 6 inches above the water's surface.

### 17. Troglodyte Cavern
The troglodytes that infest the Glitterhame have claimed one of the largest caverns as a common room and food storage area. They defend it against all intruders. Characters coming from area 16 might not be able to see everything at first.

>>Floundering through the cold, swift stream, you emerge in a huge cavern. The ceiling must be thirty feet overhead, and the far end of the cave is lost in darkness. A foul stench assaults your nostrils immediately. The remnants of butchered game animals hang from crude wooden stakes along the cavern walls, and you spot a pair of orc corpses treated in the same fashion.
>>

The grisly trophies that decorate the room represent about two or three weeks' worth of meals for the troglodyte tribe. The troglodytes like to let their meat age a bit before eating it, so most of the carcasses here are appallingly decayed.

***Creatures.*** Two **troglodytes** are hiding in the northern end of this area, one on each side of the stream. Their Chameleon Skin trait gives them advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. They attack as soon as two characters have entered the area, likely achieving surprise.

***Mud-and-Wattle Door.*** The troglodytes have blocked the southwest passage leading to the main warren (area 18) with a crude plug made of mud and wattle. A successful DC 10 Strength check is required to pull it open. If alerted by the sounds of battle, the troglodytes on the far side secure the door, increasing the DC of the check to 15.

***Pool.*** The stream flows through the center of the cavern, growing somewhat wider and deeper until it reaches the southeast corner. The pool in that location is about 20 feet across and about 10 feet deep in the middle.

Along the eastern edge of the pool, a short passage leading to *area 23* has been blocked up with loose rubble and mud, creating a rough stone wall 10 feet across. Characters can break through this barrier with some effort; it has AC 16 and 50 hit points per 5-foot segment.

### 18. Troglodyte Warren
Most of the troglodytes dwell in a group of dismal caverns, occupying three caves that branch off the warren's central area to the northwest, southwest, and southeast.

>>The passage opens into a long, low cavern that has three narrow, twisting passages leading off into darkness. Numerous rock columns rise to meet the stone overhead. The air is thick with troglodyte stench, and the floor is littered with refuse from the monsters' meals and gnawed bones of dubious origin.
>>
>>Something scrapes and hisses in the dark, and you hear the soft padding of scaly feet on rock.
>>

Characters who are being stealthy might catch the troglodytes unawares. If the characters are carrying any light sources or making a lot of noise when they enter, the troglodytes in the west and southeast chambers are alerted. As soon as any fighting begins, one troglodyte attempts to escape to the north, toward area 19, and summon **Kaarghaz**, the chieftain.

***Northwest Chamber.*** Two **troglodytes** are sleeping in the small cave to the northwest when the characters enter area 18.

***Southwest Chamber.*** The females tend the colony's eggs and raise hatchlings in the southwest cave. Six **troglodytes** defend the hatchery and fight to the death to defend their young.

The chamber also contains two dozen noncombatant hatchlings, which scurry away from intruders. Characters receive no XP for slaughtering them.

***Southeast Chamber.*** Three **troglodytes** recently returned from the hunt are relaxing in the southeast cave. Unless they are alerted to the characters' presence, they are concentrating on devouring what's left of a small deer.

***Tactics.*** If the characters attack the troglodytes in the northwest or southeast chamber, those in the other chamber hear the sounds of battle and rush to assist. The troglodytes in the southwest chamber remain there to protect the hatchlings; if the characters attack the hatchery first, all the troglodytes from the other chambers come to join the fight.

### 19. Chieftain's Cave
The door leading north from area 18 is a mud-and-wattle barrier wedged in place; a successful DC 10 Strength check is required to pull it aside.

>>Glowing coals in a crude hearth illuminate this large cave. The ceiling here rises about fifteen feet above the floor, and rubbish and skins cover the floor. A lizard the size of a small horse rises and slowly slithers toward you.
>>

***Creatures.*** The chief of the troglodytes, **Kaarghaz**, occupies the chamber along with his pet **giant lizard**. **Kaarghaz** is a **troglodyte** with the following changes, which increase his challenge rating to 2 (450 XP):

- His AC is 13 (natural armor).
- He has 39 (6d8 + 12) hit points.
- His Charisma is 15 (+2).
- He can speak Draconic and Troglodyte.
- He has an additional trait:

***Spellcasting.*** **Kaarghaz** is a 4th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following sorcerer spells:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt*, *mage hand*, *poison spray*, *prestidigitation*, *ray of frost*

1st level (6 slots): *burning hands*, *shield*, *sleep*

2nd level (3 slots): *invisibility*, *scorching ray*

If the characters make a lot of noise or tip off their presence in some other way, **Kaarghaz** begins this encounter invisible (see below). Otherwise, read:

>>Behind the lizard, a hulking, scaly-skinned creature easily a foot taller than any of the others you've seen glares at you and snarls.
>>

If **Kaarghaz** is alerted to the party's approach, he casts *invisibility* on himself before they enter. If he loses at least half his hit points, he tries to escape (using *invisibility* if possible). If his escape succeeds, he soon afterward rounds up a war party of surviving troglodytes from other areas to track down and ambush the party.

***Negotiation.*** **Kaarghaz** starts out hostile and won't become friendly to the characters. Nevertheless, a character who speaks Draconic might be able to stave off combat by parleying with the chieftain. For example, the characters might have captured some of the hatchlings in the southwest chamber, intending to ransom them back to the troglodytes in exchange for treasure. Even if **Kaarghaz** can be convinced to give up some of his wealth, he doesn't let the matter rest—he forms a war party (as described above) and goes after the characters.

***Treasure.*** The chief's chamber is strewn with trophies, including the skulls, bones, hides, and weapons of defeated foes. Amid the mess, a small square of black silk hides a ruby worth 300 gp. It can be found with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. A battered wooden chest with leather hasps holds 1,500 sp.

### 20. Scaly Lair

>>The swift stream passes over a steep slab of bedrock in front of a short passage. The cave beyond is long and low, with an uneven ceiling about ten feet high. In the southern end of the room, an enormous white-scaled lizard lunges and snaps, but you can see that a sturdy chain around its neck tethers it in place. The agitated creature twists in frustration, its tail lashing.
>>
>>Behind the lizard lie a couple of iron chests.
>>

***Creature.*** The cavern holds the troglodytes' secret weapon—a freshly captured **giant subterranean lizard** (see *appendix B*). Although the lizard is chained, it can attack anyone who comes within its reach. It strikes with its tail first, hoping to knock a target prone, then snaps at it with its powerful jaws to gulp it down.

***Treasure.*** The two chests contain a total of 2,200 sp. One holds a *potion of climbing*, and the other a *potion of water breathing*.

### 21. Orc Tunnel

>>Several passages branch away from this large, high-ceilinged cavern. To the north, a carved, square-mouthed tunnel shows that someone has been at work in these caves. A gate of rough-hewn timber blocks a small passage to the northeast. Three other passageways wind off toward the south. A heavy animal smell lingers in the air.
>>

A hundred years ago, the orcs besieging Khundrukar tunneled into the dwarven stronghold. The cavern they emerged in now serves as a guard post and a mustering point for troglodyte raiders.

The tunnel in the northern end of the area runs about 500 feet and opens on the hillside (see the "Orc Tunnel" subsection of "*Scout the Area*"). The troglodytes use the opening to raid and hunt on the surface.

***Creatures.*** In the northern part of the cavern, near the passages that run east and west, two **troglodytes** are hiding. From their Chameleon Skin trait, they have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide. The troglodyte on the west side waits for an opportune moment to attack intruders with surprise. The other moves east to the gate and opens it to release a **brown bear**, which attacks any non-troglodyte in the next round (roll initiative for the bear when it is released).

***Bear Pen.*** A sturdy timber gate, latched on the outside, seals a smaller cave to the east. The bear attacks any non-troglodyte that opens the cage door, then tries to escape through the tunnel.

The animal isn't trained but has come to expect food from the troglodytes. It is hostile toward strangers, but someone proficient in Animal Handling might be able to calm it down with a DC 15 Wisdom check. If the check succeeds and no troglodytes remain nearby, the characters can release it safely and let it depart.

### 22. Fungus Cavern

>>A trickle of water seeping down from the hillside above reaches this irregular cavern, nourishing a profusion of fungus—weird puffballs, tall caps, and patches of fuzzy mold in a variety of colors. A golden-brown carpet of mold covers an old skeleton in rusted mail in the southern part of the room, and a narrow passageway leads to another small room beyond this one. A surprisingly bright sword gleams in the skeleton's bony grasp.
>>

![[007-fof01.webp|right|300]]

***Hazard.*** The skeleton that the characters first see is that of a dwarf. From its location, it's possible for someone to see a second skeleton (human) in the south end of the chamber. Both skeletons are covered with a particularly virulent form of mold. A character can identify the threat with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check.

If either skeleton is touched, the mold ejects a cloud of spores that fill a 10-foot cube originating from the skeleton. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of this time, unless the poisoned condition is removed, the creature must repeat the saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Exposing a patch of the mold to sunlight or dealing any fire damage to it destroys it.

***Treasure.*** The dwarf skeleton clutches a *+1 longsword* that bears Durgeddin's smith-mark. The human skeleton wears a steel helmet chased with silver, worth 110 gp.

### 23. Dwarven Sepulchers

>>You gaze into an extremely large cave faintly lit by natural phosphorescence. Its ceiling rises fifty feet high in places. Crystals glimmer softly in the eerie light. Weird, beautiful flows and structures of delicate stone grace the chamber. The western portion of the great cave is separated from the rest by a steep bluff; the ceiling here is half the height of the rest of the chamber.
>>
>>A couple dozen large stone sepulchers line the cavern walls, each carved with intricate reliefs and designs and marked with Dwarvish runes.
>>

The upper portion of the great cavern was intended to be the final resting place of Durgeddin's clan.

Durgeddin and his followers feared that their war against the orcs would ultimately claim them all, so they built their own tombs during the first phase of carving out the stronghold. Ironically, only a handful of the dwarves were ever interred here; the rest lie where they fell when the orcs stormed Khundrukar.

The troglodytes have a superstitious fear of the tombs and refuse to set foot in this part of the Glitterhame. They don't pursue characters who enter this area.

If the characters investigate the tombs at greater length, read:

>>Twenty-three sepulchers stand here. The lids are carved in the likenesses of grim dwarves in armor. Dwarvish runes on the front of each tomb appear to represent the names of the occupants or the intended occupants. Three of the stone coffins have additional runes carved into them.
>>

If someone in the party can read Dwarvish, the following details become apparent:

>>The additional runes record the occupant's date of death and the great deeds the dwarf performed in life. Also carved into these three coffins is a warning that doom awaits any who dare to defile the honorable dead.
>>
>>The names on these three sepulchers are those of Borgol the Old, Gharin Orc-Doom, and Numik the Unlucky.
>>

***Treasure.*** Each tomb is a marble vault 6 feet long, 4 feet high, and 3 feet wide, with a heavy stone lid. Despite the warnings carved on the tombs, there is no danger here. Even if the characters disturb Borgol, Gharin, or Numik, all they find are old bones and no undead.

The three dwarves were buried with little funerary wealth; Durgeddin's folk believed in honoring their dead with stone, not riches. Borgol's remains include a ring of gold in the shape of a dragon holding its tail in its mouth, worth 120 gp. Gharin was buried with a finely crafted *warhammer* inset with a garnet, worth 110 gp.

### 24. The Glitterhame

>>This great cavern glimmers with a faint phosphorescence. The ceiling is almost fifty feet overhead, and bright flecks and gleaming stone formations are visible in the distance. Patches of strange fungi dot the floor, including capped stalks standing as tall as a human and glowing puffballs almost a yard wide.
>>
>>High ledges rise fifteen to twenty feet above the floor on the north, south, and west walls. Narrow passageways lead off to the north and the south, and a flight of carved stone stairs descends from the western ledge to a path that meanders through the center of the chamber toward a small iron door in the eastern wall. Audible throughout the entire chamber is the sigh of a soft, cool breeze that rises toward the surface far above.
>>

The fungal growths are harmless. In fact, the stalks and the puffballs are edible, if not especially tasty. The danger lies in the grick nest that overlooks the path.

***Creatures.*** Two **gricks** lurk in the 20-foot-high rockfall that spills down from *area 26*, at the place where the path leading east comes closest to the slope. They are wedged into spaces between boulders, 6 to 8 feet above the cavern floor. Their Stone Camouflage trait gives them advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, so they might surprise the party.

The gricks attack anyone who travels on the path next to the rockfall or climbs anywhere along the slope that leads to area 26. Any character trying to scale the rockfall while under attack must succeed on a DC 8 Strength (Athletics) check to make progress. If the characters reach area 26 by some other means, the gricks move to attack them there.

### 25. Long Cavern

>>The thunderous roar of falling water fills this long, low chamber, and spray makes everything slick and wet. A fast stream rushes through the center of the cavern, emerging from beneath a crude dam of rock and mud in the western wall. The stream disappears into a dark shaft at the cavern's eastern end. A rough, winding path follows the stream toward the east.
>>

The chamber runs from the troglodyte warrens to a natural shaft on the east end that leads down into the Sinkhole (see *area 28*). The stream spills over the edge of the shaft in a subterranean waterfall, and near the waterfall a narrow, winding stairwell leads down.

***Slippery Slope.*** The smooth cavern floor slopes down toward the stream, and much of the area immediately north of the stream is covered with a thin layer of slime. The slime makes the floor very slippery. Its presence can be discerned with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check.

Any creature that enters the slippery slope or starts its move there must make a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. A creature that fails the check falls prone and slides southward toward the stream at half its walking speed. The stream is flowing fast enough that anyone who falls in must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw to avoid being swept over the waterfall.

A creature that goes over the waterfall lands in a pool 60 feet below (see area 28), taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and suffering one level of exhaustion.

### 26. Grick Lair

>>A rocky ledge sits at the top of a steep, irregular rockfall about twenty feet high. The mouth of a side cavern leads into darkness beyond.
>>

***Creatures.*** The two **gricks** hidden in the rockfall (see *area 24*) make their lair at the end of a passage that winds north from the ledge. They are encountered here if they retreated to attack characters who got past them.

***Treasure.*** The gricks discarded the inedible portions of their victims in the back of the cave. Rooting through the grisly remains uncovers a suit of *scale mail* and scattered coins totaling 200 cp, 180 sp, and 60 gp.

### 27. Iron Door
The entrance to Durgeddin's halls and forges lies behind a sturdy locked door.

>>Cut into the cavern wall is a small but strong-looking door of iron plates, about five feet tall and four feet wide. Heavy rivets stud its surface, and a tarnished silver rune—Durgeddin's smith-mark—gleams on the door's rusted face.
>>

The door consists of two pieces of sheet iron bolted to a strong frame. A pintle is fitted through the door's middle, so it has no hinges. It can be opened with the key on the dwarf skeleton in the prison (see *area 34*). A character can pick the lock with thieves' tools and a successful DC 18 Dexterity check. Breaking the door down is very difficult, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength check.

On the other side of the door is a steep staircase that leads up to *area 35* in the Foundry.

## The Sinkhole
The stream that flows through the Glitterhame descends through the chasm in *area 25* to an even lower level of caverns—the Sinkhole. Here it joins a subterranean river that traverses dark caverns and forgotten storerooms before connecting with the Black Lake.

None of the monsters that inhabit the complex regularly visit this place. The black dragon Nightscale sometimes swims through its submerged areas, using the river as a back door to its lair.

A narrow staircase winds down along the chasm walls until reaching bottom, where it offers access to area 28.

![[012-tfof03.webp|right|300]](Player Version)The following locations are identified on map 2.4.

### 28. Waterfall Cavern

>>A loud waterfall spills down the northwest wall of this cavern into a deep pool. The rocky walls glisten with spray, and a weird array of colorful minerals and strange lichens lend an unearthly beauty to this spot. A fast-moving stream runs south from the pool at the base of the falls, and a nearby natural passage heads in the same direction. A set of narrow stairs cut into the rock wind up to the north, and two old wooden doors stand in a wall of dressed stone to the east.
>>

The stream flowing from *area 25* in the Glitterhame pours down into the chamber.

The pool is populated by harmless blind fish and white crustaceans but contains nothing dangerous. The outflowing stream drains into the river in area 29. Any characters who fell into the pool are carried by the current toward the outflow at about 20 feet per round. A character who ends up in the river might be swept away; see "*Fast-Flowing Water*" below.

### 29. River Cavern

>>This long, narrow cavern is half-filled with an underground river, flowing along at a rapid pace. A narrow ledge on the north side overlooks the river. A bridge of stone spans the river, leading to a larger ledge on the south side that follows the course of the river to the east.
>>

The underground river flows swiftly from east to west. The bridge is sturdy and sound; there's no danger in crossing it.

***Watery Peril.*** At the west end of the cavern, the ceiling lowers to meet the surface of the river. Any creature swept past this point by the current is trapped in a long, airless underground channel and is likely to drown (see "*Suffocating*" in chapter 8 of the *Player's Handbook*). In addition, the creature must make a successful DC 12 Strength saving throw each round or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage as it is battered by rocks. Even creatures that can breathe water aren't likely to survive for long.

The stream runs underground for about 5 miles before emerging on a hillside to the west of the Stone Tooth.

### 30. Old Storeroom
The northern door in *area 28* has swollen shut from dampness. A successful DC 10 Strength check is required to force it open. Durgeddin's folk formerly used the large chamber beyond as a storeroom.

>>The door gives way grudgingly, revealing a low chamber of dressed stone. This chamber is filled with what appears to be rotten food—barrels of salted meat gone bad, sacks of flour or grain covered in russet-colored mold, tuns of cider turned to vinegar.
>>
>>Two open archways in the east wall lead to a similar room, and two more openings are dimly visible beyond. The floor just past the first archway gleams wetly.
>>

***Creature.*** None of the supplies are salvageable. While searching, the characters might blunder into a **gray ooze** that occupies the middle chamber of the three.

While motionless, the ooze is indistinguishable from a patch of wet stone. It is alerted when characters force open the door, and it strikes at the first character who enters the middle chamber, attacking with surprise.

>>What appeared to be a wet patch on the floor suddenly twists like a snake and lunges toward you!
>>

### 31. Empty Storeroom
The southern door in *area 28* is swollen shut and requires a successful DC 10 Strength check to open. The chamber on the other side of the door resembles area 30, but it is empty. The orcs broke in and carried off most of its contents during the fall of Khundrukar.

### 32. Flooded Storeroom
A year or so ago, a season of heavy rains on the surface raised the level of the subterranean river to create a minor flood. Water still stands at the bottom of the stairs.

>>A short flight of stone steps leads down to a wooden door that stands half-open. Dark, stagnant water pools in the small landing at the base of the steps and in the doorway, presumably filling the room beyond as well. The area smells of rot.
>>

***Diseased Pool.*** The water is about 5 feet deep and is tainted by disease. Anyone who drinks the water or wades into it is exposed and must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid infection. Symptoms manifest one day after exposure and include high fever, muscle spasms, and eventual paralysis.

An infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion when it finishes the first long rest it takes after being exposed. Whenever it finishes a long rest thereafter, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers another level of exhaustion. On a successful save, its exhaustion level is reduced by one. If its exhaustion level reaches 5, the infected creature becomes paralyzed until the disease is cured or the effect is removed with a *lesser restoration* spell or similar magic. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's exhaustion level to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.

***Treasure.*** Submerged in the corner of the eastern vault is the skeleton of an orc killed a century ago. The skeleton rests atop a rotted leather pouch that contains a *potion of water breathing* and a *potion of invisibility*.

### 33. Roper's Cavern

>>The rock stairs climb steeply, turn north, and then descend toward the east into a cavern very much like the one you just left, but smaller. A ledge along the river continues east to a door on the north wall, and the rushing river separates you from a ledge on the southern side.
>>
>>A large, strange-looking stalagmite stands in the middle of the southern ledge. A cave fish flops helplessly on the bank nearby.
>>

![[009-totyp-02-09.webp|right|300]]

***Creature.*** The southern ledge is the home of a ravenous **roper** that has been feeding on fish from the stream. Unsatisfied with this diet, the roper is eager for larger prey.

Even characters who look closely at the roper can't tell that it's anything other than a stalagmite unless it moves. The roper is difficult to sneak up on. If a character manages to approach without alerting it, continue:

>>A strand extends from the stalagmite, with the thrashing cave fish in its grasp. It pulls the fish toward the rock formation—and then, suddenly, a fang-filled maw gapes open in the stalagmite and devours the fish in one bite.
>>

The roper attacks when any character gets at least 20 feet into the cave, gaining surprise if its presence hasn't been revealed. It can target up to four characters with its tendrils, possibly pulling those it has grappled into the rushing river. Characters in the water have advantage on checks to escape the grapple due to the force of the current. The river poses a severe hazard in itself, though; see "*Fast-Flowing Water*" below.

***Development.*** The roper is satisfied, ending the attack, after it devours one Small or larger creature. It can't speak or understand languages, but it has a bestial intelligence and might be persuaded to accept a substitute meal. As long as the food is alive, the roper isn't picky.

***Treasure.*** Cutting open the roper's stony gizzard reveals a *ring of spell storing* and six gemstones: a ruby worth 1,000 gp, two emeralds worth 400 gp each, and three serpentines worth 60 gp apiece.

### 34. Prison
If the characters get past the roper in area 33, they can explore an area that was used as a prison in Durgeddin's day.

>>A sturdy door of iron plate stands open in the north wall of the cavern. Inside you see a short passageway with three small iron doors set into the west wall. The first two are open, but the door at the end of the hall is closed.
>>

The door to the northern cell is locked. With a search of the grimy floor and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character discovers an old jailer's key that fits the lock. Otherwise, the lock can be picked by someone who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

The first two cells are empty. The locked cell holds the skeletal remains of a dwarf in rusted plate armor. This individual was one of Durgeddin's chief lieutenants; the orcs captured her during the final battle and threw her in this cell for interrogation later. Afterward, the unfortunate warrior was forgotten and left to starve.

***Treasure.*** The suit of plate is too corroded to be of any use, but a search of the corpse produces a small silk purse containing 8 pp and a key that opens the iron door in *area 27*.

## The Foundry
Durgeddin's followers lived and worked in a series of carved halls and chambers beyond the Glitterhame. Most of this part of the complex was thoroughly ransacked when the dwarven citadel fell.

Unlike the Mountain Door or the Glitterhame, which offer exits to the surface world, the Foundry isn't readily accessible. The area isn't abandoned, though. Undead horrors wait in its darkest recesses, and dwarf-crafted traps still work perfectly well despite their age. In addition, a small number of duergar have come here to breathe life into Durgeddin's old forges and decipher the secrets of the master smith's work.

If the characters come to this part of the complex from the Black Lake (see the "Dark Mere" subsection of "*Scout the Area*"), they begin in *area 38*.

![[015-tfof04.webp|right|300]](Player Version)The following locations are identified on map 2.5.

> ##### Fast-Flowing Water
>The underground river that cuts through this level of the dungeon presents a serious hazard. Those who fall in risk being swept away by the current.
>
>A creature that falls in the river and is within 5 feet of the water's edge must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw to catch itself on the rocky bank. On a failed save, or if the creature is too far away from the bank, it is drawn into the main current.
>
>A creature in the main current that takes no other action is swept 60 feet downstream (to the south or to the west, depending on location) each round. If it spends its action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check and the check is a success, it can reduce the distance traveled by the amount of its walking speed and move toward a bank.
>
>On a failed check, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. Creatures that have a swim speed can take the Dash action and use their full swim speed without making a Strength check. A creature within 5 feet of a bank can pull itself out of the current as part of its move.
>

### 35. Chamber of Statues
In the corridor behind the iron door in *area 27*, a flight of steep stone stairs climbs 30 feet northward.

>>The stairs end at the entrance to an octagonal chamber. The floor is inlaid with cracked, dusty blue tiles, and the walls are dressed with polished marble. Large doors of iron-bound oak exit to the northwest and northeast.
>>
>>Three cast bronze statues, almost ten feet tall, stand by the west, north, and east walls. Each depicts an armed dwarf. The eastern and western ones carry axes and shields. The center statue is armed with two axes. The ceiling rises in a dome almost thirty feet above the floor.
>>
>>From somewhere in the distance, you can hear the faint ringing of hammer on anvil.
>>

The sound of the hammering comes from beyond the east wall, as can be determined with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Anyone who examines the floor notices that the dust is somewhat disturbed. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals an infrequently used trail that leads from the entrance stairs to the stone wall behind the east statue.

![[011-totyp-02-10.webp|right|300]]

***Statue Trap.*** The obvious exits to the northeast and northwest are false doors that open onto blank stone. Pulling on either door releases a catch that causes the axe-wielding hands of the two closest statues to drop. Any creature within 5 feet of a door when it is opened is subjected to two melee attacks: +5 to hit; 9 (2d8) slashing damage on a hit.

With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can discern small scorings on the floor in front of a door, left by earlier axe strokes. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check enables a character to deduce that the doors aren't what they seem, through small clues showing that they are unused. The same check focused on a statue can reveal a small line on the arm that holds an axe, indicating the arm's ability to move.

A character who makes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools can jam a statue's arm so that the axe can't swing. Destroying a statue (AC 18, 60 hit points, immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage) also disables its attack.

Once a statue has attacked, the trap must be reset manually. If any duergar survive and remain here, they reset the trap within a day after it has been triggered.

***Secret Stairwell.*** The secret door behind the east statue is well hidden, requiring a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot. If the characters detected the faint trail that leads there, a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check locates the door. Beyond is a flight of stone stairs that leads upward.

The stairs have been warded with a magical alarm. When a creature ascends past the halfway point of the staircase, a *magic mouth* spell calls out in Dwarvish, "Alert! Alert! Intruders approach!" This sound warns the duergar guards in area 36.

### 36. The Great Hall
At the top of the stairs from area 35 is a stone door carved with a glowering dwarf's face. It opens easily.

>>This enormous hall is lined with ten great pillars, carved into the forms of giants and dragons, that support the vaulted ceiling high above. Guttering orange torches set in sconces along the walls illuminate the room, and a mighty throne sits on a dais at the opposite end. The walls were once covered with tile mosaics, but they have been smashed and defiled by graffiti. Tiny fragments of tile litter the floor. You can see five other exits. A small fire smolders on the floor before the dais, where six sleeping pallets lie empty, surrounded by packs and supplies. The sound of hammers ringing on iron comes from beyond the doors to the south.
>>
>>Suddenly a harsh voice calls from the shadows of the pillars, "Go back the way you came! This is the only warning you'll get!"
>>

The cavern was formerly Durgeddin's throne room, banquet hall, and center of authority. Its ceiling is 30 feet high, and the sconces are 10 feet above the floor. The throne is unremarkable: a short bench of stone that might have been decorated at some point in the past. The graffiti consists of crude epithets in the Orc language insulting dwarves and their ancestry.

***Creatures.*** Two **duergar** guards and Ghared, a **duergar spy** (see *appendix B*), stand watch here. Unless the party climbed the stairs from area 35 without triggering the *magic mouth*, the duergar are invisible.

***Negotiation.*** The duergar start hostile but wait to see if the characters attack. Ghared shouts the initial warning and speaks for the group; she's suspicious, greedy, and arrogant, but not stupid. She is willing to give information to the party if a character succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. The characters can change her attitude to indifferent, reducing the check DC to 10, with a suitable bribe (at least 100 gp).

Ghared can share any of the following information if the party succeeds in getting her to converse:

- The doors to the north lead to halls infested with undead and cursed magic.
- The door to the southwest leads into the old kitchens, guarded by more cursed magic.
- A dragon lives in a large lake cavern deep below.
- The subterranean river flows from the lake through other parts of the complex below the Glitterhame. It's fed from a lake on the surface.

If negotiations are successful, the duergar are willing to let the party enter the rooms to the north. With a sufficiently high Charisma (Persuasion) check and an indifferent attitude from Ghared, the characters can get the duergar to escort them to the entrance to the dragon's territory (the chasm in *area 38*). The duergar will not allow the party into the bladeworks (area 37) without an escort, and they prohibit entry into *area 39*.

If the characters don't negotiate, or if talks go badly, combat ensues.

***Tactics.*** If combat occurs, the duerger guards first attack with their javelins. They use their Enlarge ability in the next round, taking cover behind two of the pillars before wading into melee.

Meanwhile, Ghared remains invisible and maneuvers to make a sneak attack, then enlarges herself after she becomes visible. She has a *potion of healing*, which she uses if her current hit points drop to half her hit point maximum or lower.

If two duergar fall in battle, the survivor tries to retreat to area 37 or 39.

### 37. The Bladeworks
In what was Durgeddin's smithy and workplace, the duergar are currently engaged in a secret project, hoping to capture a spark of the master smith's vengeful magic.

>>Double stone doors lead into a barrel-vaulted area containing several furnaces. The eastern end of the chamber continues into a large, dark cave, from which a cold wind moans. A stream of water rushes from west to east through the center of the room, crossed by two stone bridges. On the other side of the stream, three bald, gray dwarves work at a roaring forge, beating a white-hot blade into shape on an old anvil.
>>

***Creatures.*** Two **duergar** smiths are forging a blade at the forge in the center of the south wall. The work is overseen by **Snurrevin**, a **duergar** with the following changes, which increase his challenge rating to 2 (450 XP):

- He has 45 (7d8 + 14) hit points.
- His Intelligence is 14 (+2).
- He has an additional trait:

>***Spellcasting.*** **Snurrevin** is a 3rd-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

>Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *shocking grasp*

>1st level (4 slots): *color spray*, *shield*, *silent image*

>2nd level (2 slots): *hold person*, *shatter*

**Snurrevin** has a familiar, a **rat** named Browngnaw, that hides in the shadows near the unlit forge to the east. The duergar are preoccupied with their task and don't notice the party's entrance unless the characters make themselves known. They object violently to intruders who aren't escorted by duergar.

If a threat becomes apparent, the two smiths grab their weapons, use Enlarge, and move to guard the two bridges. If the fight goes against them, they turn invisible and try to slip out to area 36, then join the other duergar in *area 39*.

In combat, **Snurrevin** might cast *shocking grasp* through his hidden familiar, and he might use *silent image* to confound enemies with realistic-seeming threats.

***Treasure.*** In the cold forge in the northwest corner of the room, **Snurrevin** has stashed 320 gp, 1,100 sp, a gold necklace set with ruby stones worth 900 gp, and a *potion of hill giant strength*.

### 38. The Chasm

>>The stream running through the old dwarven bladeworks meanders through a natural cavern before tumbling into a great chasm. You can see nothing but darkness below, although the splashing of waters deep below is barely audible over the roar of the waterfall.
>>
>>To the north of the chasm, a small ledge is partially hidden by a spur of rock.
>>

The chasm is 120 feet deep. Anyone who falls in takes 42 (12d6) bludgeoning damage and ends up in *area 50* of the Black Lake level. Climbing down the slippery stone next to the waterfall requires several successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) checks, or DC 5 checks for a character who uses a rope.

### 38a. Chain Ladder
The rock spur on the northern ledge partially conceals an old chain ladder that leads down to *area 51* of the Black Lake. The ladder isn't immediately obvious from the southern ledge, but a character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot it.

### 39. Council Chamber
The duergar have set up a guard post in what was once the council room of Khundrukar.

>>The door behind the throne leads into a small audience chamber. A large table made of a single stone slab dominates the room's center, and old tapestries cling to the walls. A stone door in the far wall is carved with the dwarf's visage that you've seen elsewhere.
>>
>>One gray-skinned dwarf in scale mail and shield stands watch by the far door. He shouts and raises a javelin.
>>

***Creatures.*** Unless the party is under Ghared's protection (see *area 36*), the lone **duergar** on duty fights to the death to protect his leader, who is in area 40.

If the characters engage the duergar guard, the sounds of battle alert the leader, **Nimira**. She is a **duergar** with the following changes, which increase her challenge rating to 3 (700 XP):

- Her AC is 17 (splint armor).
- She has 52 (8d8 + 16) hit points.
- She has additional traits:

>***Multiattack.*** **Nimira** makes two greatsword attacks.

>***Greatsword. Melee Weapon Attack.*** +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, or 16 (4d6 + 2) slashing damage while enlarged.

**Nimira** uses Enlarge and comes out to join the fight in the next round. If her guard falls or she faces at least three enemies, and negotiation isn't an option, she turns invisible and tries to escape into area 36 or through the secret door that leads east out of area 40.

***Negotiation.*** **Nimira** is an excellent fighter, but she is pragmatic and willing to negotiate in the right circumstances. She knows the same information as the duergar in area 36 and might be convinced to guide the party to the chasm that leads to the dragon's lair (*area 38*).

> ##### Arundil's Animated Objects
>A century ago, the dwarf mage Arundil animated a number of objects to defend the Foundry against intruders other than dwarves. Many of these creations remain in place today (in areas 41, *47*, and *48*).
>
>These animated objects never attack dwarves or duergar. In addition, a dwarf (including a duergar) can order an object to cease its attack. If so commanded, the object becomes immobile for 10 minutes, or until the one commanding it leaves the area.
>

### 40. Durgeddin's Quarters
Durgeddin led a spartan lifestyle, eschewing rich decorations and treasures in his personal quarters. **Nimira** has appropriated the room for her own use.

>>This room appears to be a bedchamber. In one corner to the south stands a large wooden sleeping platform, badly gouged by axe blows and partially burned. A table, a bench, and a writing desk have been similarly treated. In the middle of the southern wall, a space has been cleared for a simple sleeping pallet and a pair of large satchels. Two doors exit the room to the north.
>>

If the party enters the room through the secret door in the closet (see below), or if the characters avoided or quietly dealt with the guard in area 39, **Nimira** is here, resting on the pallet. Otherwise, the room is empty. The satchels contain mundane supplies: extra clothes, food, lamp oil, and similar stuff.

The door in the northwest corner leads to a bathing area, fitted with two small clay tanks to hold wash water. The northeast door opens into a closet containing the mildewed remnants of several cloaks.

***Secret Door.*** The east wall of the closet conceals a secret door. The door isn't well hidden, requiring a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. **Nimira** knows about the secret passage and escapes through it if pressed.

### 41. Kitchens

>>The stairs leading south from the pillared hall end at a wooden door. Beyond is a corridor that opens up into a large room lined with hearths. This room must once have served as the kitchen: pots, pans, cauldrons, and kettles lie scattered on the floor and strewn across several tables. An archway to the west leads into a pantry filled with rotted foodstuffs. Suddenly, you hear a scraping sound, and a big wooden table shudders and begins to move, heading right for you!
>>

***Creature.*** An **animated table** (see *appendix B*) activates when someone enters the main part of the room. It fights until destroyed but won't attack a dwarf. See the "*Arundil's Animated Objects*" sidebar.

The room is full of old, rusty iron pots, pans, cutlery, and cooking utensils, none of which are worth much.

![[012-totyp-02-12.webp|right|300]]

### 42. Desecrated Shrine
Durgeddin made his last stand in Khundrukar's shrine, laying enemies low until the orcs finally overwhelmed him. Orc shamans pronounced dire curses over his remains to ensure that their terrible foe would never return. Then they entombed a fierce orc warrior to defend it forever in undeath.

The door leading from *area 36* bears an inscription in Orc: "Beyond this door the Maker of Death is chained. May he gnaw on his own hate until the sun dies and all things end."

>>This room was once a shrine to the gods of the dwarves. The walls are carved with their dour images, and a low stone altar stands at the western end of the room. Stone benches have been smashed and thrown askew, and the icons of the gods have been defaced.
>>
>>Atop the altar, arms folded over his chest, lies the ancient corpse of a dwarf warrior in plate armor. Bones lie heaped around the altar's base, and at its foot crouches the desiccated body of an orc in studded leather.
>>

***Creatures.*** The orc champion is now a **wight**, an undead monster that thirsts for life essence. Two of the piles of bones are **ogre skeletons** (use the **ogre** stat block; give it the undead creature type, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, immunity to poison damage, and immunity to the exhaustion and poisoned conditions; and remove its ability to speak). The ogres were slain during the final battle and later animated to join the orc warrior in his watch.

The wight and skeletons lie immobile until someone enters. They can't pursue characters outside room.

>>Some of the bones at the foot of the altar stir and form into a pair of towering skeletons clutching greatclubs. The dead orc warrior looks up at you and grins evilly, green fire burning in its hate-filled eyes as it stands.
>>

***Treasure.*** The orcs looted the shrine after the fall of Khundrukar, but two members of the previous expedition fell to the undead defenders with valuables in their possession. Under a scattering of bones near the altar can be found a sack that holds 280 gp and a bone case that contains a *spell scroll* of *web* and a *spell scroll* of *spider climb*.

### 43. Entrance to the Dwarf-Halls
The dwarves of Khundrukar once resided in private rooms to the north of the great hall. When the orcs came through, they cut down all the dwarves they found and stripped the treasure out of the place.

>>The door opens into a large chamber with a dark pool in the center. Bits of smashed furniture and other debris are scattered about the floor. Hallways lead off to the east and the west.
>>
>>A weird moaning fills the area, slowly becoming recognizable as Dwarvish curses. The sound rises to angry shouting and grows closer. Then the translucent form of an armored dwarf appears through a wall and attacks!
>>

***Creature.*** Area 43, *area 46*, and all the rooms marked 44 are now the demesne of the dwarf mage Arundil, who lingers as an insane **ghost**.

The ghost relentlessly attacks anyone who enters its territory (most likely in either area 43 or area 46) but can't pursue characters who retreat beyond its domain. If the ghost is turned, it flees to one of the empty rooms labeled as area 44.

***Development.*** Arundil's ghost is tormented by grief and shame over abandoning his kin to die (see *area 47*). The spirit might be laid to rest if the characters can convince it that they have cleansed Khundrukar.

### 44. Looted Rooms
Severak chambers in the Foundry were once living quarters, drawing rooms, barracks, armories, storerooms, and so on. Now they contain only smashed furniture and debris from the final battle, graffiti in the Orc language, and skeletal remains of dwarves and orcs.

***Treasure.*** Here and there a remnant of something valuable can be salvaged from the trash. Roll a d10 the first time a character searches a given room; on a result of 10, the character uncovers a semiprecious stone (see the 10 gp Gemstones table in chapter 7 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).

### 45. Skeleton Room
One of the smaller chambers once served as a small barracks. Half a dozen dwarves perished here and were later animated by Arundil (see *area 47*). He ordered them to defend their post against all intruders.

>>This chamber might once have been a barracks. The remains of six wooden bunks lean against the walls, burned and hacked by pillagers, and half a dozen skeletal dwarves lie here and there on the floor. With clicking and scraping sounds, the skeletons rise and advance on you.
>>

***Creatures.*** The six **skeletons** attack any non-undead creature that enters. They don't pursue anyone beyond this chamber.

***Treasure.*** The rogue from the failed expedition lies in this room, her desiccated corpse half-buried under wrecked furniture. A pouch on her belt contains 670 sp.

### 46. Common Area
The open courtyard in the east end of the residential area was the site of a pitched battle between dwarves and orcs.

>>The hallway leads to a large open chamber. Three doors open into it, and a dark pool fills a low stone basin in its center. The chamber is littered with the remains of old warriors. Seven dwarf corpses lie where they fell a hundred years ago, surrounded by the remains of at least a dozen orc warriors. The dead have been stripped of their arms and armor; only a handful of broken weapons and shattered shields remain.
>>

***Creature.*** If the characters approach this area from the secret door to the south before entering *area 43*, Arundil the **ghost** confronts them here; refer to the encounter in area 43. Otherwise, there is nothing dangerous or valuable in the area.

### 47. Arundil's Chambers
Arundil, the leading mage of Khundrukar and Durgeddin's trusted advisor, lived in a spacious room close to the great hall. During the final assault of the orcs, Arundil used his magic to escape the slaughter. He returned to find all his kinfolk dead. Driven insane with grief, he tried to repair some of the complex's defenses, animating dead warriors and various objects to kill any intruders that returned. In his madness, he even summoned a fiend (see *area 49*), and he perished at its hands not long after.

>>This chamber must once have been the personal quarters of an important dwarf. It is decorated with tapestries and furnished comfortably, although age has taken its toll on the contents. Apparently, the room has not been looted. A beautiful rug covers the center of the floor, and a simple bed and writing desk stand in the southwest corner.
>>

***Creature.*** The rug, 20 feet square, is actually a Gargantuan **rug of smothering** that activates when any non-dwarf sets foot on it. It fights until destroyed but doesn't attack a dwarf under any circumstances. See "*Arundil's Animated Objects*" above.

***Treasure.*** Beneath the bed is a small wooden chest containing 1,200 sp, 3,000 cp, and a square of silk in which are wrapped a star sapphire worth 500 gp and a pair of matched blue topazes worth 90 gp each.

### 48. Looted Armory
Khundrukar's armory was looted long ago. Its door is made of iron plates, but the lock was broken during the pillaging—it can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

>>Rows of empty weapon racks and a dozen or more armor stands indicate that this room was once an armory. Some debris litters the floor, but nothing of value is readily apparent.
>>

***Creature.*** One of the armor stands is actually an animated object (use the **animated armor** stat block), which activates when a non-dwarf enters the room. It fights until destroyed. See "*Arundil's Animated Objects*" above.

### 49. Idalla's Den
The mad dwarf Arundil used every magical tool at his disposal to protect the complex. He not only animated objects and the bones of the dead but called upon more dangerous magic in his futile attempt to make the place safe. In the former chambers of a dwarf scholar, tucked away in the eastern end of Khundrukar, he found a scroll that he tried to use to bind a fiend to his service.

>>This room was once a library or a study. Bookshelves stand against the walls. Piles of books rest on a reading table in the middle of the room. The air reeks of moldy paper. Doors exit to the north, east, and south.
>>
>>A beautiful, slender woman with long black hair sits in a chair at the table, looking extremely sad. Her clothing, though well worn, does little to detract from her appearance.
>>

***Creature.*** Arundil summoned a **succubus** and commanded it to guard the area that is now the domain of Arundil's ghost (see *area 43*). But the fiend easily overpowered Arundil's will, then toyed with him cruelly until it finally drained his life force.

The succubus, which calls itself Idalla, claimed the scholar's library for its own and spends much time here reading through the collected lore. It learned of Khundrukar's history from the scholar's records and realized that the legends of wondrous treasure would lure greedy souls. It consumed the wizard from the previous expedition, who took refuge in this library after his companions were killed. Since that time, it has spread rumors to draw more adventurers to its lair.

Idalla takes the form of a human woman. When the characters enter, the fiend jumps up and begs to be released from imprisonment. Idalla tells the characters that she is a captive of a wizard who resides below this level. The succubus plays the role to the hilt, trembling and crying as it spins a tale of woe. It tries to split up the group, persuading one character to remain (using its Charm attack if necessary) while the others deal with the wizard. If they leave anyone alone with Idalla, the fiend attempts to kiss and drain the hapless dupe. The succubus is an adept liar and mixes in just enough of the truth to be convincing; see the "Idalla's Story" sidebar.

If the characters attack, Idalla attempts to charm the most dangerous-looking character and turn him or her against the party while the fiend fades into the Ethereal.

> ##### Idalla's Story
>Idalla takes delight in misleading the characters. The fiend can impart the following bits of information:
>
>- The wizard lives below this area. He wants to use Idalla for a study on prolonging life. (False.)
>- The wizard told Idalla a bit of the history of Khundrukar and the fate of Durgeddin, which she can pass on. (The information is true, but the succubus learned history from reading the books here, not from the wizard.)
>- A doppelganger lurks in the Glitterhame. (False.)
>- A dead dwarf haunts the halls, reduced to a mad, gibbering spirit. (True; this is the ghost of Arundil.)
>- An ancient dragon lairs below the Foundry. (Partly true; Nightscale is a young dragon.)

***49a (Bedchamber).*** The adjoining room was the sleeping quarters of the dwarf scholar. It is moldy and very stuffy. Anyone who looks around the room finds a secret compartment in one of the walls with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Treasure.*** The dwarf scholar amassed a small amount of treasure, which he kept in the secret compartment: 110 gp and a cat's-eye gem worth 70 gp. In the library, in addition to an extensive collection of dwarven lore, the characters can find four *spell scrolls* (of *alarm*, *disguise self*, *enlarge/reduce*, and *shield*). The shelves might also include more scrolls, useful information tying in to future adventures, items of value to a collector, or other interesting lore, as you see fit.

## The Black Lake
The darkest and most remote corner of the Glitterhame's cavern system, the Black Lake is a large, winding cavern filled with water that drains from the Dark Mere through a submerged siphon. From the lake, the subterranean river flows west through the Sinkhole, across the bottom of the chasm in *area 3* of the Mountain Door, and onward for about 5 miles until it emerges at the surface.

The dwarves of Khundrukar never settled these caverns, although Durgeddin had his followers begin work on an escape route through the depths.

The Black Lake is now the domain of Nightscale, a **young black dragon**. Here she has built her hoard, having slowly collected most of the remaining loot from Khundrukar. From the lake, Nightscale can swim to the Sinkhole, climb up to the Glitterhame, or fly up to the Foundry through the chasm there. The troglodytes fear and worship the dragon. The duergar have negotiated an uneasy truce with Nightscale, paying her a modest tribute to leave them alone.

The following locations are identified on map 2.6.

![[019-tfof05.webp|right|300]]
### 50. The Cascade
The stream in *area 38* flows over the edge of the chasm and pours down into a turbulent pool.

>>A thundering spray of water fills this chamber, pooling and flowing out to join a larger river to the north. The air is damp, and the roar of the waterfall is deafening. A broad ledge heads north toward the river and then turns out of sight to the east. The muddy bank of the pool looks disturbed by tracks of some kind.
>>

A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check identifies the tracks as those of a Large reptilian creature with four feet and a long tail. The tracks lead away from the hard stone of the ledge to the north (where they can't be seen) and into the water.

### 51. Dwarven Bridges
Durgeddin's followers built two stone bridges when they started work on the escape route through this level. The chain ladder that drops from the north ledge of area 38 ends just above the ground in the area south of the western bridge.

If the characters reached this area by using the chain ladder or otherwise descending through the chasm, read or paraphrase the following text. Adjust the information as needed if they arrive here by a different route.

>>A fast-moving underground river roars from east to west under a stone bridge. The bottom of the chain ladder is near the south bank of the river. On the north side of the bridge, a ledge continues to the east.
>>

If the characters go north and cross the bridge, read:

>>After a short distance, the ledge leading east bends to the south, and a second bridge surmounts the river.
>>

The western bridge is safe, but the bridge to the east is not. It has settled considerably, some of its stone blocks leaning precariously. Also, the stone has a curiously pitted appearance (which was caused by Nightscale's acid breath). A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check can determine that the stone was affected by acid, although the source of the acid isn't apparent.

***Hazard.*** The weakened bridge can't take much weight before it collapses. If more than one Small or larger creature is on the bridge at one time, or if a character in heavy armor steps onto it, the arch fails. Any creature on the span must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to catch itself on the ledge. On a failed save, a creature falls, takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from falling timbers and stones, and is caught in the river's current (see "*Fast-Flowing Water*" above).

### 52. Nightscale's Lair
When the characters first approach the southeastern shore of the lake, Nightscale is dozing on her hoard on the island (area 53). The dragon is immediately alerted to their presence if the characters make noise, carry light sources, or trigger the collapse of the bridge. Otherwise, the characters don't draw the dragon's attention unless they move all the way to the ledge directly south of area 53.

>>The dilapidated bridge leads to another ledge that winds southeast alongside a very large lake, apparently the source of the underground river. The cavern is quite large; the lake's far shore is lost in shadow, and the echoes of water seem to indicate a very sizable cave.
>>

***Creature.*** When Nightscale becomes aware of intruders, the **young black dragon** slips into the water, quietly swimming to a point near the three stepping stones shown on the map. Any character watching the lake can make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the dragon's Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a successful check, the character catches a glimpse of a serpentine form moving in the darkness.

The dragon takes full advantage of her aquatic environment and never offers an easy target to enemies. She begins combat at a range of 20 to 30 feet, raising only her head and part of her neck above the water (granting her three-quarters cover) and breathing acid. Then she submerges and waits for her breath weapon to recharge. Nightscale doesn't resort to melee combat unless she is confronted underwater. If the dragon is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, she tries to escape through the passage in *area 54*.

***Negotiation.*** Nightscale isn't inclined to parley with the characters unless they surrender, give her all of their treasure, and throw their arms and armor in the lake. If the characters seriously injure her, Nightscale might bargain to buy time so she can later move her hoard. Only when she is near death does she abandon her treasure.

### 53. Nightscale's Hoard
When the characters come into view of the island for the first time, read:

>>A short distance offshore sits a small isle thirty or forty feet across. Stalagmites thrust up at the ceiling above, and the dark waters lap quietly at its shores. Several spots on its surface glimmer even in the gloom, suggesting the promise of treasure to be had.
>>

Nightscale keeps her treasure on the small island in the lake, and she spends most of her time resting here. If the characters have avoided attracting her attention so far and want to approach the island, they can do so quietly if every character's Dexterity (Stealth) check meets or exceeds the dragon's passive Perception score.

***Treasure.*** Nightscale has accumulated considerable wealth from her plunder of Khundrukar. Her hoard contains 6,200 sp, 1,430 gp, two garnets worth 20 gp each, a black pearl worth 50 gp, a *wand of magic missiles*, a *+2 greataxe* bearing Durgeddin's smith-mark, a *+1 shield*, a *potion of healing*, and a *potion of flying*.

### 54. The Dragon's Passage
Beneath the surface of a small pool is an underwater passage that links the Black Lake to the Dark Mere on the east side of the Stone Tooth. The submerged passage is about 700 feet long.

## Aftermath
The characters have overcome Khundrukar's dangerous inhabitants and looted the dragon's lair. What next?

### Resolving the Character Hooks
If the characters return to Blasingdell, their fame as adventurers spreads. Townsfolk hail them on the street, and some might approach them with problems that can lead to further adventures. The characters can continue to use the town as a base of operations. Other developments depend on what got them here and how they leave.

#### Follow the Map
While the characters are exploring the stronghold, they might find another map, perhaps on the body of an adventurer from the previous expedition, or in the library in *area 49*. It could lead to a different dungeon, a city in some land far away, or an as-yet-unknown location rumored to hide a fabulous treasure.

#### Track the Broken Blade
If the characters were sent to retrieve weapons for Baron Althon, they can bring him the *+1 longsword* from *area 22*, the *+2 greataxe* in *area 53*, the *handaxe* from *area 14*, and the *warhammer* from *area 23*. All bear Durgeddin's smith-mark; Baron Althon pays 500 gp above the market price for each mundane weapon, 1,000 gp for the *+1 longsword*, and 6,000 gp for the *+2 greataxe*, if the characters are willing to sell.

#### Vanquish the Orc Raiders
The characters can return to Blasingdell at any time to collect the bounty for orcs they kill or capture. If the characters eliminate all the orcs in the stronghold, the mayor honors them with a celebration attended by the eminent citizens of the town. The characters have established valuable contacts who can aid them in their later endeavors.

### Further Adventures
You can build an entire campaign around the duergar that occupy the Foundry. Perhaps they came here from a hidden city in even deeper caverns beneath the Sinkhole and the Black Lake. Your answers to the following questions form the basis for further adventures:

- How did the duergar get into the complex?
- What is the mysterious project they are working on?
- Did Durgeddin know of the duergar's existence?
- Do the duergar have some of Durgeddin's items? If so, are they guarding them or using them?

You can also use this adventure to sow the seeds of the characters' next activity. Perhaps the party encounters a legend of a magical treasure from Khundrukar's fall, buried in the tomb of an evil knight. Maybe **Great Ulfe**'s ogre clan is terrorizing a nearby area, or an orc war chief wields a legendary weapon that was crafted by Durgeddin.

Whatever form they take, the repercussions of the characters' descent into Khundrukar have the potential to affect their lives for years to come.
