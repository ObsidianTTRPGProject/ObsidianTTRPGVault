# Kelvin's Cairn
## Overview
Kelvin's Cairn was a free-standing 1,000-foot-tall mountain fronted by a river valley about as deep as the mount was high. The mountain top was always capped with snow and ice even through the short summer. The mountain was the only peak within a thousand miles, even though it appeared as merely a pile of loose boulders.
