# B8 - Kelvin's Comfort
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The most popular tavern in [[G6 - Town|town]], owing to its extensive stock of dwarven ales and brandies, is Kelvin's Comfort. The common room is bedecked with dwarven craft of Battlehammer make, but most of the liquors are imported from [[Mirabar]], on the other side of the [[Spine of the World]]. The one [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]] specialty of note is a treacly mead from [[Good Mead]], a neighboring settlement. Caravan masters and guards with plenty of coin often come here, as do visiting dwarves from Kelvin's Cairn. The proprietor of Kelvin's Comfort is Ogden Flamebeard (NG male shield dwarf **commoner**), who has a temper as fiery as his signature drink-a Mirabarran rotgut he gets for cheap and rebottles as Flamebeard's Firebrandy (reselling it at a sizable markup). In his youth, Ogden worked in many famous mines, and he has contacts throughout the dwarfholds of the North, including [[Mithral Hall]].

One of the patrons of Kelvin's Comfort is **[[Sir Baric Nylef]]** (see appendix D), a knight of Tyr and a member of the Order of the Gauntlet. He's hoping that a few shots of Flamebeard's Firebrandy will keep a nasty cold at bay while he keeps an eye out for a dwarf named Worvil "the Weevil" Forkbeard, a criminal rumored to be hiding in [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]]. The Weevil led a gang of dwarf brigands that raided summer caravans traveling between [[Luskan]] and [[Mirabar]]. He also spearheaded several raids on the [[Mines of Mirabar]], stealing food and drink mainly. The Order of the Gauntlet captured most of his gang, but Worvil disappeared into the mountains. Interrogation of the captives led Barie to discover the Weevil's mad craving for Flamebeard's Firebrandy. So, Barie has adopted the guise of an unemployed caravan guard, and his plan is to hang around Kelvin's Comfort for a few days, on the chance that his quarry will walk right through the door.
