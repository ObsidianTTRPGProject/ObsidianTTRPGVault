# III - The High Ice
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Mountains, Hills, Glacier
#Geographical-Region/Mountains #Geographical-Region/Hills #Geographical-Region/Glacier

Least known of the three regions of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], this glacial wilderness has no known (as yet) northern border-it is said to stretch on forever. Although a traveler would search in vain for trees, there is a surprising amount of life here, growing scant inches upwards from the ice and rock. Here yeti, remorhaz, white dragons, and other chill horrors reign over a frigid land that few humans have ever seen-and fewer want to.

Most of Anaurochmile upon trackless mile, a space larger than any six Realms or so that one might combine, in ones mindis covered by a vast, fissured glacial ice sheet. Its rifts and heights are innumerable, and few bear names (or hold anything of interest) to any but the savage creatures who dwell there.

Legends whisper of cities locked in the eternal ice, buried forevercities of great elven magic, and lost dwarven wealth, and proud orc splendorbut if any living being in the Realms has walked the hidden ways of such cities, they have not spoken of it (except, of course, for Elminster, who raised an eyebrow, and said, Of course theyre there still: Annarath, Bhaulaea, and the rest. When I asked him where they were, he merely smiled and said, I do believe my memory is failing. It does that, ye know, after five hundred years or so, and Im much older than that, now.) A few landmarks, however, are known to folk of the Realms today, and appear on the maps. These include the Smokeholes, the Rift of Stars, and Llashloch, the Lake of Ice.

## Story
No human has ever found the northern edge (if there is one) of the seemingly endless expanse of snow, ice, and finally, glacial ice that covers the northern reaches of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. As desolate and wind-flayed a wilderness as the more southerly and dry areas of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], the High Ice (sometimes called the High Land in old texts) is an ice plain broken by deep crevasses, and roamed by dangerous remorhaz. The remorhaz dine on the fabled yeti, crevassedwelling ice toads, packs of winter wolves, and scurrying snow snakes (a local, white-furred, icy-blooded species of normal constrictor snake; refer to the Snake entry in MC1). These all dine on the icejacks, plump, hare-like furred herbivores who in turn feed on the abundant, tumbleweed-like snowflowers, found in vivid purple, yellow-green, and pink hues in crevices in the ice and rock, or blown over the plain by the frigid winds.

Above all of these wing great soarers (white-feathered arctic condors, identical to their temperate cousins; refer to the Vulture entry in MC3) and smaller scavenger birds, who glide silently above the snow, riding the winds. Most of these winged hunters are harmless to anything larger than a dog, but blue dragons and wyverns are also known to hunt over the frigid waste.

The High Ice holds natural dangers aplenty for intrepid adventurers: falls due to ice, avalanches of ice and snow, suddenly-opening crevasses, and the biting cold.
