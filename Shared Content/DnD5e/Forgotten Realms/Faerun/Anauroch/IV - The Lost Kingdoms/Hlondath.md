## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Other
#Geographical-Region/Other

Least powerful of the Three Realms, northerly Hlondath was a land of loggers and herdsmen (who kept sheep, goats, and shaggy cattle). Its capital was Mhaelos, but its most important city was Rulvadar, a fortified refuge against marauding ogres, orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, and flind for folk in the Moonsea North. Companies of spearmen made many forays into the Border Forest. Under their protection, Hlundites made sturdy wagons, fine furniture, paper, and lumber to ship to other lands.
