# Anauria
## Overview

#Geographical-Region/Other

Richest of [[IV - The Lost Kingdoms|the Lost Kingdoms]], Anauria was a human-ruled land of humans, elves, and halfelves, where nobles hunted boar, stags, and monstrous game while the farms of the commoners produced food for the Three Realms, and spare grain enough to sell to all the lands about the Inner Sea. From its glittering capital, Amazandar, the City of Gems, Anauria dominated overland trade to and from the Three Realms. Rich gemmines lay underneath Amazandar, reached by well-guarded deep shafts that were kept as secret as possible by the noble families that owned them.

The most powerful noble families of Anauria were the elven houses of Nyntynel and Olyrnn, and the human lines of Thardresk (the royal house), Nemrin, and Maluradek. Anaurias greatest king was Thausimbel The Wise (a.k.a. Greybeard and The Long- Lived). He had elven blood, and ruled for three hundred and sixty-odd years, arranging alliances, marriages, and business dealings that wove long-lasting peace between elves, the dwarves of Oghrann, and humans in what was to become known as the Dragonreach.

The city of Anauril was noted for the making of fine steel swords, the best human smiths produced in the Moonsea North at that time. Anaurias best forges were here, working plentifully with iron and tin (but lacking much copper and zinc). Helvara was Anaurias main agricultural market and farm outfitting center. The prosperity of the land was guarded by the fortresses of Tower Hlithal (which guarded against the goblins of Araugul, nomadic ore hordes, and occasional outlaw raiders out of [[Asram]]) and Tower Ramanath (which patrolled against brigands and monsters out of the Hunters Hills).
