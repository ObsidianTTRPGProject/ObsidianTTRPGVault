Anauroch, or The Great Sand Sea, was a magical desert in northern Faerûn. It held the remnants of the once-powerful Netherese Empire, their flying enclaves having crashed to the ground when their greatest mage Karsus, in a desperate bid to end the war against [[The Phaerimm|the phaerimm]], challenged the goddess Mystryl for her divine mantle, causing the Weave to falter and all magic to fail. For generations since, Anauroch, the greatest desert in Faerûn, encroached relentlessly on border nations, burying them beneath the sands.

### Trade Routes of Anauroch
![[ox2gw0rc.se1.png|Trade Routes of Anauroch|300]]
[[ox2gw0rc.se1.png|open outside]]

### Inhabitants
The only people to call Anauroch home were the nomadic Bedine tribes and a small Zhentarim garrison, tasked with patrolling and defending a line of oases along [[The Black Road|the Black Road]], the trade route that winded west from the ruins of Teshendale to Llorkh at the foot of the Graypeak Mountains. A diminutive people called the [[D'Tarig|D'tarig]] were the only other major inhabitants, who lived along the borders of the desert and interact somewhat with peoples from surrounding countries.

Finally, on Nightal 20 in 1372 DR, the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar (also known as the City of Shade) of the ancient Netherese Empire re-emerged from the Plane of Shadow in the skies above the Dire Wood, before drifting into Anauroch, settling above [[The Shoal of Thirst|the Shoal of Thirst]], bringing the evil and warped Shadovar into the Realms.

### Life and Society
[[The Bedine]] nomads were simplistic in nature and survived by raiding and guiding caravans through the hidden passes, making their home on the surface of the wastes, traveling from oasis to oasis. They were divided into a dozen or so minor tribes lead by sheiks, whose wealth was measured not by gold, but by the size and well-being of their herds. [[The Bedine]] were good-natured and noble, and the encroachment upon their home by the Shadovar trapped them in an exposed position. Suspicious of magic at the best of times, they had to deal with a vastly superior magical force altering the environment around them.

[[The Zhentarim]], always eager to make a profit, fought long and hard to secure routes for their caravans through the desert. The northern routes across [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]] were plagued by monsters too numerous to fight and in the south humanoid raiders and interference from the Dales and Cormyr hindered their efforts. After years of painstaking effort [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] created a caravan route via oases in [[I - The Sword|the Sword]], the sandy southern portion of Anauroch. The garrison constantly fought to defend its territory, but despite years of bitter fighting with [[The Bedine|the Bedine]], [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] held little more land in Anauroch than that on which they stood.

Below the dunes of Anauroch lurked what remained of the evil phaerimm, a race of reptilian spellcasters with near-unrivaled mastery of the Art, long imprisoned in a magical shell called the Sharn Wall under the desert. [[The Phaerimm|The phaerimm]] were forgotten by all but the wisest of sages until the barrier holding them was broken. After fighting the combined armies of most of Evereska, Evermeet, the Heartlands, the Chosen of Mystra, and the Shadovar—all at once—the remaining phaerimm were scattered beneath the surface.

The returned masters of Anauroch, the ancient Netherese wizards of Thultanthar, warped and twisted by their long exile in the Plane of Shadow, were determined to retake what they considered their birthright, longing to restore the barren wasteland that was Anauroch to the once-fertile land of [[V - Netheril|Netheril]]. The Shadovar had a regimented society, ruled by Telamont Tanthul and his Princes of Shade, all working in unison, toughened by centuries of hardship in the Plane of Shadow, to accomplish their common goal. They all but ignored [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] and Zhentarim, considering them beneath their notice.

## Notable NPCs
Prominent among the veteran independent incense traders currently active in the Anauroch trade are Bruithyn Ammacaster, of Selgauni (LN hm F6), and Guldagh Ironfist (NE hm P7) of Westgate.

Bruithyn is known to carry an iron bands of Bilarro sphere, to deal with those who threaten him. He is always accompanied by a loyal bodyguard of at least three Sembian mercenary warriors, and a priest of Lathander for healing purposes, hired at the temple in Eveningstar. These priests are always well paid, and Bruithyn is popular at the temple for the extra gifts he makes to the cause, when his trade goes well.

Guldagh is the sort of thug that one prefers never to deal with. He would steal the shroud off a corpse (and has). His band of nine or fewer (the number varies with the number of fatal skirmishes gotten into on the present trip) thieves are drawn from the poisoneddagger boys of Westgates dirtier alleys. Guldagh persuades them to take a chance to get rich quick (and usually, to flee certain death if they stay in the city, due to feuds theyve gotten themselves drawn into), and then plunges across Cormyr or Sembia in an orgy of petty theft, vandalism, and muggings.

Guldagh then leads his band to Dtarig territory, does the same sort of thing there until hes gained as much incense as possible by illegal means, and then heads west along the Desertsedge, trading for as much more as he can get. If enemies show up, his band darts into the Stonelands. Increasingly, orcs have lain in wait for him. It is whispered that he has a fortified lair somewhere in the Stonelands, but no one has ever found it. An organized bandit troop is also said to lair in the Stonelands, raiding orc-holds, Bedine encampments, and caravans in northern Cormyr with equal stealth and boldness. Known as The Desert Wind, this band is a myth, or a memory of a desperate band now dead in some misadventure, or able to lie low for years on endfor no one has seen them in recent seasons.

## Background
### News and Rumors of Anauroch
News tends to be old and poor in remote Anauroch, with Bedine tribes avoiding each other as much as possible (unless bent on killing each other; which is not likely to present good opportunities for chatter and gossip).

Whenever the PCs have peaceful encounters (e.g. with traveling merchants), the DM may pass on some of the following rumors. Roleplaying should be encouraged; NPC merchants wont simply babble all the latest news whenever they, see an unfamiliar face. If Bedine are passing on these bits of news, the DM should alter the wording in light of Bedine knowledge of the Realms outside Anauroch. Some of these rumors could mask DM-prepared adventures: others can be simply wild fancies.

[[Belarchass the Slaver]], a notorious slavedealer who captures humans and demihumans at swordpoint to sell them into slavery in the cruel South, is hunting people again. He is somewhere north and east of Mabel, with at least twenty warriors.

There is powerful magic awake in the desert: beware old stone pillars, and archways that lead to nowhere! Some who step wrongly, near such, have vanished in an instant, stolen awayby magic!

Strange whirlwinds, seen in calm conditions, not just in storms, are growing more common everywhere on the sands. They are evil things, Wind Walkers, who serve an evil Elder Race That Dwells Below, under the sands. The ancient evils must be awakening again!

There is an oasis, somewhere deep in [[The Quarter of Emptiness|the Quarter of Emptiness]], that is hidden by magic. Only women dwell there: cruel women, who use magic and can change their heads to take the forms of fanged, hissing serpents! They are ruled by a queen whose lower body is like that of a huge snake, but whose upper form is that of a beautiful woman. She eats all men who fall into the hands of her subjects after they have been forced to breed, to swell the ranks of the women of the hidden Oasis of the Serpent. All male babies are eaten; all females must master magic or be cast out into the desert.

Certain stone pillars in the northern sands move about by themselves, when the nights are dark! They sometimes move as far in a night as a fast, driven camel does, by day-and they cry out to each other at times; horrible deep, groaning sounds that make ones teeth itch, to hear them! One is moving steadily toward [[The Oasis of Vipers]]!

A great spiralling pit, like a sucking mouth, has been seen somewhere nearby, west of here. It moves along, in the sand, and things that tumble into it vanish, and are never seen again. It must eat them! A gazelle has been seen to disappear into the mouth, and so did a hunting dog that got too close!

An oasis has been found where there has never been one before! It looks old, and well established, with several trees and a deep pool. It is no mirage-and camels who drank from the pool were well sated. Fresh-gnawed bones were found under one of the trees, though-human bones.

## Introduction: Anauroch, The Great Desert
*"When we learned their aims, it was too late. We could not strike down what had been done without laying waste to all Toril. Too high a price, we judgedand left them the harsh sands they had created. But for humans, memory is a failing thing, and today we see a savage desert that makes men as cruel and keensharp as swordblades, or leaves their bones to bleach in the sun. Not even legends remember fair [[V - Netheril|Netheril]] as it truly was; folk think of us as decadent, idle, wholly evil necromancers.*

*I wonder how, much else of the history we hold to be true is twisted thus?"* - Rhaugilath the Ageless, Lich-King of Orbedal Of the Fall of [[V - Netheril|Netheril]]

To folk in the Realms today, Anauroch (pronounced: An-OAR-ock-hh) is a fierce, unconquerable desert, a vast, sundering shield between the Sword Coast North and the Moonsea North. It forces trade and travel into long, torturous overland routes between the westernmost ports on the Sea of Fallen Stars (chiefly Westgate, Suzail, and Teziir) to Amn, Baldurs Gate, and Waterdeep, mostly by way of Iriaebor and the River Chionthar.

These strategic places are enriched by the endless stream of caravans, but merchants have always sought shorter, cheaper routes, often braving the flat but harsh Great Desert.

Always? Not so, say the sages: little more than five hundred years ago, Anauroch held little sand, and several verdant, wealthy human realms-with lakes and merchant ships of their own. At least one of these lands, [[V - Netheril|Netheril]], was then the height of human achievement in magic and the arts.

What happened to so suddenly and thoroughly sweep all this away? DMs will find the answer in The Secret of Anauroch chapter; players perusing these pages should resist the beckoning temptation to peek at it, so as to fully enjoy the perils that lurk in Anauroch and even reach out to those who sneak along the Desertsedge.

Most folk of Faerun see Anauroch as a scorching waste of sand, The Wall That Near Divides The Heartlands, a good place never to go near. What can be found in a barren desert, to be worth the dangers of the trip?)

Most folk, as is often the case, are wrong. The first things Elminster said of Anauroch was that it is not a natural desert, and is not all hot sands. Anauroch today is three deserts: the hot, sandy place most imagine it all to be, called [[I - The Sword|the Sword]] by sages because of the fierce human Bedine nomads who dwell there; a higher, wind-scoured land of bare rock, called [[II - The Plain of Standing Stones|the Plain of Standing Stones]], though very little of it is a flat plain: and in the north, a vast, riftscored ice sheet overlying bedrock, known as [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]]. These three areas were once very different. All held proud, rich cities of elves, men, dwarves, and others; cities that may still stand, buried or merely hidden by the vast desolation, their riches waiting. Elminster says Anauroch is the largestand probably wealthiest-treasure-house in all Toril. Even those who agree can show fell, treasures recovrered from it, but when this was pointed out, Elminster merely shrugged and held up an ornate, hand-sized carving of a spired castle. Strolling to the door of his ramshackle tower, he tossed it into the air, whispered a secret word-and in the meadow beyond his pool, a huge castle of black obsidian suddenly stood, tall and splendid and very real.

When too many guests come calling to sleep here, the Old Mage of [[Shadowdale]] said mildly, I always have this; one of the least powerful magics of the Netherese, but the only one Ive found in Anauroch. I havent much time to go wandering about there, mind-this was just lying on a table, in an old house half-buried in sand. Where? He smiled, and waved northwards. Ohjust out there. This book explores all three regions of Anauroch, for those who want to go just out there.

## Outsiders
There arent many sane folk who choose to visit Anauroch more than once (most visitors perish on their first trip into the Great Desert). As might be expected, some of these are desperate outlaws trying to hide from pursuers, and others are adventurers overly convinced of their own heroic invulnerability. The most numerous group, however, are merchants: those who come to make a coin or two. Some, notably [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]], come in force, and try to make their way by force. They must he powerful indeed to overmatch the fierce Bedine, the desert beasts, and the claws of the desert itself.

Some dream of the fabled wealth of [[IV - The Lost Kingdoms|the Lost Kingdoms]], and hire adventurers or even try on their own, to scurry into the desert to scoop up the heaps of gold coins and rivers of gems that they fondly hope must be just lying around, guarded only by a few camels and vultures.

The wisest merchants set their sights on less grand dreams. They come to the desert verges, bringing coins, food, fine cloth, and iron-work such as chains, belt-buckles, drinking cups, buckets, cooking pots, knives, forks and ladles, and the like. They trade these to the Dtarig and others who dwell along the Desertsedge, for resins and the occasional caged desert beast or Lost Kingdom tombartifact. These incense traders travel along the Desertsedge, in well-armed groups, and then depart, leaving the dangerous task of trading with [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] out on the sands to the Dtarig. These merchants make much smaller heaps of coins than the other sorts, but they make them year after year, and may even live to retire on them (a fate that seldom befalls the other two sorts of merchants).

## A whirlwind Tour of Anauroch
The accompanying map provides a quick overview of Anauroch. Folk of Faerun have a tendency to think of the Great Desert simply as an empty but impassable place-and explorers interested in it may hear lots of wild tales about its dangers, but will find almost nothing in the way of hard information about an area that is at least as big as the Inner Sea! Hence this guide. At a glance, one can see that Anauroch has been divided into three regions: [[I - The Sword|the Sword]], [[II - The Plain of Standing Stones|the Plain of Standing Stones]], and [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]].

These vast areas (which are admittedly artificial divisions, made by human sages for their own convenience) vary widely in their dangers and character, and are detailed in separate chapters of this sourcebook.

## The Secret to Anauroch
The name Anauroch once meant just what now called [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]]: a rift-scarred glacial ice sheet that gave way (as one traveled south) to rocky uplands where many wild sheep roamed and thence to thick forests where stags reigned and dryads dwelt. Those uplands now scoured to bare rock are known today as [[II - The Plain of Standing Stones|the Plain of Standing Stones]].

South of them were rich, verdant human kingdoms and independent citiessmall, but governed by long years of peace and plenty and bustling with trade. These, whose very names are forgotten by most in the Realms today, are [[IV - The Lost Kingdoms|the Lost Kingdoms]] (and are described in the chapter of that name, later in these pages).

That was less than five hundred years ago but since then, the meadows and forests of the wild uplands have been swept away, and the woods, farms, lakes and cities of [[IV - The Lost Kingdoms|the Lost Kingdoms]] all buried in the howling sands of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]].

Impossible, sages who know little of magic might sayand have. No desert comes out of nowhere, to cover so much of Faerun, so fast, True enough; no natural desert grows so large, so quickly. A magical change, however, can be as sudden and violent as its maker has the power and will to cause.
