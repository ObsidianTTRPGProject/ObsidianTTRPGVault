Tracker of the Harpers, who aids good travelers and folk against orcs, [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]], and other dangers of the desert, is a mysterious individual much given to disguises, who lives in a cellar in a nameless ruined community south of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Ascore]]. When not in disguise, he (actually, Tracker is a woman, but conceals this from all but close friends by magic and dress) appears as a wild-haired, grim man in the rotting remnants of much-patched armor. Trackers wry nature can be summed up by his cesspit, near his cellar home, which bears a sign: Last Dungeon Before Waterdeep.
