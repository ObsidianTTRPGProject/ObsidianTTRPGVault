a notorious slavedealer who captures humans and demihumans at swordpoint to sell them into slavery in the South. Captives are drugged asleep with treated needles and weapons wielded by Belarchasss Band (of twelve warriors, three priests, and two mages).

## Profile
Belarchass keeps his true identity secret, but is known to have powerful magical items. Slaves are taken by an ancient, secret gate linking a certain spot in Anauroch with a certain cellar in Westgate, to the holds of ships, which sail to Chessenta and beyond.
