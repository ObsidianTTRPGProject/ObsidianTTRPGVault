# Oreme
## Overview
**Type**: Ruin
#Adventure-Area/Ruin

Another former port on the vanished Narrow Sea now stands isolated in the sands about two hundred miles east of Weathercote Wood. Oreme of the White Towers was a city of artisans, ruled by proud, independent mages. All are long since fled-except, legend whispers, those who became liches. The adventurer Steeleye told of fleeing from a demi-lich somewhere in the sand-choked streets and shattered towers of this city. Vultures nest on the towers that still stand. From afar, travelers have seen at least one tall tower still towering above the sands: broader about than many castle keeps, and as tall as thirty tall warriors. Others have fallen, crushing great gaps in the walls in their ruinous descent, and lie like the shattered skeletons of beached whales, broken and white amid the shifting sands.

This far south, the sands thaw in summer, and storms blow inland from time to time, bringing moisture into the desert. From Weathercote Wood in a giant arrowhead pointing northeast, scrub plants and sagebrush grow in scattered clumps, providing abundant forage for camels and other desert dwellers. This forage not only enticed [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] (and others before them) into thinking caravans could easily cross the sands, but provided a relatively easy road for explorers bent on An explorer today will find mushrooms and plundering abandoned Oreme.

The easy road is still there, but fewer pass that way, these days; Realmslore tells of the liches of Oreme, and less terrible but no less fatal desert predators, and of many spell trigger magical traps left behind by the mages of Oreme, to bring ill on those who might come seeking to plunder. Whether or not anything of worth is left in Oreme remains an open question. Those who might answer it have not returned, or have chosen not to draw attention to themselves by telling tales.
