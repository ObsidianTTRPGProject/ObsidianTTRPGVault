# The Shattered Tower
## Overview
**Type**: Other, Ruin
#Adventure-Area/Other #Adventure-Area/Ruin

This famous landmark of the Plain is a cracked stone castle that looks for all the Realms as if someone rammed it into the ground hard, at an angle, from above, breaking it with the impact. That is indeed what happened. The Shattered Tower is actually a cloud castle that drifted too low, into reach of Phaerimm spells, and was brought crashing to earth, shattering into its present ruin. Of old, the fabled Cloud Castles of the storm giants hung forever above the heart of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], well above the reach of the magicdraining spells cast by [[The Phaerimm|the Phaerimm]]. The giants moved their aerial castles elsewhere long ago (chiefly to the remote North, above the Spine of the World, some say), but this ruin was left behind.

Only the magic that constructed it keeps it from collapsing into rubble. Adventurers would be wise not to use much magic while insideunless they really want to bring the whole thing crashing down on their heads! This castle has been explored (and looted) by several adventuring companies, over the years, but the mouldering bones of giants who perished in its fall still lie in its rubble-strewn halls, and years of digging await anyone who wants to be sure that theyve checked very chamber and corner for buried riches. Survivors of the expeditions that have explored the shattered castle warn that various monsters have found the place suitable as a lair, over the years.
