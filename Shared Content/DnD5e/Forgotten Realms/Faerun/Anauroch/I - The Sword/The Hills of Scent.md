# The Hills of Scent
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Hills
#Geographical-Region/Hills

This is a large area of trackless, interlocked stony sand-knolls. They are capped with gnarled, tangle-branched frankincense trees. A few scrub bushes dot the stony ground, but it is otherwise bare of vegetation. Bedine of certain tribes, it is said, know where to find four for even more) small, unadorned watering-holes hidden in the Hills. Others who go looking for these water-sources tend to find the lions who roam this region of knolls first-or rather, the lions find them.
