# The Shoal of Thirst
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Plains, Other
#Geographical-Region/Plains #Geographical-Region/Other

The Shoal is a great basin, stretching for miles in all directions: a waterless, endless salt flat. It sparkles underfoot, as fiat as a pan and as endless as the sky, white and cloudlike in full sunlight, pearl-grey when the desert sky is overcast.

The table-flat basin is so scorching that most Bedine cannot survive a trip across it. A riders eyes and throat sting with the salt and grit, and no plants grow because of the salt, so camels cannot eat (and must drink more water than usual). The rare daytime rainfalls appear as purple veils, that do not reach the ground; hot air rising from the salt flats turns the rain to vapor long before it reaches the ground. When the sunlit sky is clear, mirages of blue lakes (reflections of blue sky) are common.
