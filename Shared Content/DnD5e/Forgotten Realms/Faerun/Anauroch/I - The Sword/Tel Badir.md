# Tel Badir
## Overview
**Community Size**: Village
#Community-Size/Village

This Dtarig hilltop village stands on the eastern edge of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]], overlooked by, the Tethyamar Mountains. Its winding streets run along the tops of ridges in an area of ravines and trees, an arm of plenty that reaches out into the desert. This arm of watered ground lies between two large streams, and four smaller ones wind and cascade their ways through the arm. West of the village, the six streams gather into a river that runs out into the desert, but soon vanishes into the hot sands. Here [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] trade regularly with the Dtarig, at least once using this place to gather supplies to equip a desert army (purchasing whole herds of camels, for instance). This is the village where most outlander merchants come to buy frankincense and other desert goods, but they are careful to keep a low profile, for Zhentarim magic rules here, behind the scenes.

The wiser Dtarig resent the brutal power of the Black Robes, seeing beyond the gleaming gold coins they offer so profusely, and quietly work against the Zhents, ambushing a lone or drunken mageling when they can, sabotaging equipment when possible, and even setting tents or storechests afire. So far, [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] have blamed such activities on the hated Harpers, but the Dtarig are walking a dangerous road, and they know it. They would be only too glad to hire or assist (with hiding places and the occasional healing potion) any adventuring band that would come to Tel Badir and wipe out, or at least humble, the Zhentarimbut quietly, so as not to bring the massed might of the Zhentilar armies down on the Dtarig anytime soon.

Dtarig who are especially resolved to fight the Zhents (i.e. who would fight to certain death) include Udlara Thaerintauhn (CN hf F4), a camel-breeder whose husband was slain by a casually-cast Zhentarim spell some years ago; Dyulatar Rhaumm (NE hm T7), a young but successful thief, who spent some time as a frog before escaping a Zhent magelings polymorph spell; and the grim, grizzled Dtarig elders Thorn Abbalhar (CG hm F9) and Shandlara Iritymm (NG hf W6), both retired adventurers who have traveled far in the Realms, and know [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] for what they truly are. Thorn and Shandlara have some minor (healing) magic items, and some gold, hidden away from their adventuring days, and they will not hesitate to use it, to bring down the increasingly oppressive Zhent presence. The strength and dispositions of Zhentarim in 23 Badir is left to the DM; Zhentarim are moved often by their superiors, and operate in an atmosphere of paranoid secrecy, as they are tested by cruel masters, It is certain that the Zhents have spies in the city posing as independent outlander merchants, and have bought some Dtarig outright. It is likely that in or about the city at all times are at least twenty Zhentilar warriors, and at least eight (usually twice that) low-level (3rd to 6th) Zhentarim magelings, sent here to await the missions in which they hope to prove themselves. The major export of Tel Badir is good, sturdy, well-trained riding and pack camels. Even Bedine have been known to come shopping here, when they need replacement camels in a hurry. Much of the trade in Tel Badir consists of outfitting merchants with sand-sledges, sacks, waterskins, kegs and barrels, ropes, tents, and the like. Bedine come here often to buy metal cooking implements and (vastly overpriced) weapons.
