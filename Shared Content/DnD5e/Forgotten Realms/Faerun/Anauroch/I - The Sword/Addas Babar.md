# Addas Babar
## Overview
In the foothills west of the northern end of the Tethyamar mountains is the Dtarig village of Addas Babar. Its sprawling mud huts and mudand- beam inns (the tallest of which has three floors) can hold as many as 2,000 guests, and there is ample camping room in the area; the village sprawls over five or six ridges and the ravines and bowl valleys between them, with an open market area and only four streets that are lined with structures (as most human settlements are).

Addas Babar is the largest Dtarig settlement, and exists to serve them as a trading-center with the rest of the world; all of its Dtarig residents have real tunnel or cave-homes in the mountains and higher lands to the east, as well as their village rooms. The village also serves outlanders as a hiring center for Dtarig, a refuge of sorts (and hiring center) for human outlaws from all over the Dragonreach, and a place where traveling merchants can set up shop to sell large amounts of goods without peddling wares up and down every hill of Dtarig territory.
