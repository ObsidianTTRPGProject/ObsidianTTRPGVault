# Ma'atar
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

A rich oasis of nut trees and shaded vegetable plantings, recently created by [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] (see Created Oases, earlier in this chapter). It is encircled by a dry ditch and a stone rampart, and is said to be defended by a man who can hurl fire (a Zhentarim mageling with a wand of fire). Maatar also has a guard of three underpriests and sixteen rathered bored Zhentilar warriors. They tend the tree plantations and a carefully-watered, newly-established grazing lawn inside the encircling wall. A tranquil pool fills the center of this small oasis.

Stone buildings house [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]]; secret doors in their thick walls open into ladder-shafts, allowing one down into the tunnels where [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] are assembling caches of weapons, rows of magicallypreserved and jointed skeletons (awaiting use as undead legions), potions and other magical supplies, and so on. The mage currently in charge of the place has also piped water down two of the tunnels, and is growing the finest frill-collar mushrooms there for use both in the oasis kitchen and in his own alchemical researches.
