# Lizard Marsh
## Overview
Instead of flowing freely into the sea, the Delimbiyr River dissolves into a morass of waterways threading around and beneath trees festooned with moss, forming a vast swamp. Lizard Marsh is known for two things: bloodthirsty insects and dangerous monsters. In the event the characters find themselves here, use the Swamp Monsters table in appendix B of the Dungeon Master's Guide to inspire encounter ideas.

Near the northeastern edge of the Lizard Marsh stands Cromm's Hold, a squat stone keep surrounded by a wall. Baroness Wynne Cromm (LE female Illuskan human noble) and her garrison of eighteen soldiers (male and female human veterans of various ethnicities) watch the Lizard Marsh for signs of lizardfolk aggression. Wynne also harbors a dark secret: she has the Duchess of [[Daggerford]], Lady Morwen (LN female Tethyrian human veteran), locked in her dungeon. A succubus named Pencheska has usurped Morwen's identity, and once her work is done, she plans to install Wynne as her successor. The baroness grows impatient waiting for that day to come.
