# Westwood
## Overview
A tangled forest cloaking the eastern foothills of the [[Sword Mountains]], the Westwood is home to a shrine of Mielikki, several woodcut ters' camps that are often taken over forcibly for a season or a few months at a time by bandits or Uthgardt barbarians, and a few overgrown remnants of the ancient elven kingdom of Rilithar.
