# Amphail (Town)
## Overview
Amphail lies north of [[Waterdeep]] on the Long Road. The [[G6 - Town|town]] is named after one of [[Waterdeep]]'s early warlords, who is said to haunt the surrounding bills in spirit form, frightening away monsters. Horses are bred and trained here, rich Waterdbavians maintain secluded estates in the hills, and farmland is plentiful. Stands of dark duskwood and spruce trees are everywhere.

In one corner of the [[G6 - Town|town]] square stands the Great Shalam, a black stone statue of a famous war stallion bred in Amphail long ago. Gelded by a prankster, the rearing stone horse is often painted in bright colors by high-spirited locals. Children are allowed to hurl stones at birds perched on the statue, to help keep it free of droppings. The children often climb it themselves and cling precariously to the high, tilted saddle, waving their arms and commanding imaginary armies into battle. Within spitting distance of the statue is the StagHorned Flagon, a cozy tavern run by an gray-haired, middle-aged woman with a wry sense of humor named Arleosa Starhenge (NG female Chondatban human commoner). Born in a wild magic zone, Arleosa has the innate magical ability to cast the alter self spell three times per day. In her youth, she was a member of a traveling carnival and used this power to entertain folks. She no longer cares about using the ability, and no one in Amphail knows she even has it.

The three Waterdhavian families with the most influence in Amphail are Houses Amcathra, Ilzimmer, and Roaringhorn. These houses rule the [[G6 - Town|town]], with the controlling family changing each Shieldmeet. The current Lord Warder of Amphail is Dauner Ilzimmer (LN male Chondathan human noble), a bombastic family man who loves horses more than he does most people. Thanks largely to the influence of its nobles, Amphail is a member of the Lords' Alliance and enjoys the protection ofWaterdeep's city guard. The lord warder also hires adventurers from time to time to take care of pesky bandits and monsters.

## Suggested Encounter - SKT
It's Tylandar Roaringhorn's sixty-third birthday, and the noble wants all of Amphail to know it. He has imported the finest food and ale from [[Waterdeep]] for an outdoor banquet, and everyone in [[G6 - Town|town]] is invited. Pavilion tents and tables have been set up in the [[G6 - Town|town]] square. In the middle of the square is a platform where Tylandar plans to thank the crowd. Some cynical Amphailians view Tylandar's birthday banquet as a blatant attempt by the noble to warm hearts before he takes over as lord warder when Lord Ilzimmer's tenure is concluded.

If the characters stick around for the banquet, three male hill giants, drawn by the scents of roasted hog and grilled corn, barge into [[G6 - Town|town]]. Some townsfolk hurl food at the giants, slowing them down long enough for other citizens to clear the square of children and elderly.

If the characters do nothing, the [[G6 - Town|town]] guards help get people to safety while the giants storm the tents and grab armfuls of food before fleeing north along the [[Long Road]]. It's clear that the giants mean no harm to the townsfolk. If the characters defeat the giants or drive them off before they can grab food, Tylandar Roaringhorn (NG male Chondathan human noble) takes notice of their heroism. He tells them afterward that he has received reports of giants of various kinds attacking settlements throughout the [[Dessarin Valley]].
