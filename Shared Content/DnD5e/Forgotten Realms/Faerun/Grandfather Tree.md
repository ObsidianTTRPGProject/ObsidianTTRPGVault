# Grandfather Tree

## Overview

Deep within the [[High Forest]] is an oak tree of immense size, with a base measuring 50 feet in diameter and a crown soaring to a height of over 350 feet. Around this ancient tree are two rings of raised earth. The innermost ring has four normal-sized oak trees (healthy and mature ones) growing out of it. Buried beneath the outermost ring are the moldy bones of long-dead Uthgardt barbarians, most of them from the Tree Ghost tribe.

Tree Ghosts patrol the woods surrounding Grandfather Tree. Characters who venture into the forest on foot in search of the tree should encounter one or more patrols, each consisting of `dice: 3d6` Tree Ghost **tribal warriors** and an **Uthgardt shaman** (see appendix C). There is a 25 percent chance that the group includes one of Great Chief Boorvald Orcbane's adult children, who leads the patrol. This Uthgardt barbarian leader is a **berserker**, with the following changes:

- The leader is chaotic neutral.

- He or she has a Dexterity score of 15 (+2) and AC 14.

- He or she speaks Bothii (the Uthgardt language), Common, and Elvish.

- The leader carries an oathbow and has a +5 bonus to hit with the weapon, which deals 7 (`dice: 1d8 + 3`) piercing damage on a hit, plus an extra 10 (`dice: 3d6`) piercing damage against a sworn enemy. (See chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for other properties of the oathbow.)

haracters who travel by air have an easy time spotting the tree and can reach the perimeter of this area without encountering any ground patrols.

Grandfather Tree has AC 15, 500 hit points, a damage threshold of 15, and immunity to fire and psychic damage. As long as it has 1 hit point remaining, it regenerates 50 hit points on initiative count 0. Although it's a living creature like any plant, Grandfather Tree isn't self-aware and can neither move nor take actions. Creatures tasked with protecting the tree gain the effect of a bless spell while they are beneath its great boughs. In addition, any creature that finishes a long rest under the boughs gains the benefit of the greater restoration spell.

## Ancient Relic

Many small chambers are hidden between the exposed roots of Grandfather Tree. A Medium or smaller creature can reach these chambers by crawling among the roots. Half buried in the root network's innermost chamber is a relic of giantkind left here long ago by a mad Tree Ghost shaman: a nonmagical electrum tore etched with Giant runes. Formerly the nose-ring of a powerful bill giant chief, this U-shaped piece of jewelry is worth 250 gp as an art object and weighs 25 pounds. It can be worn around the neck by a Medium humanoid; though cumbersome, it doesn't hinder its wearer in any way.

## Suggested Encounter

Seven centaurs have come to Grandfather Tree for its restorative powers. The centaurs fell victim to a curse as they explored some ancient ruins in the [[High Forest]]. -_-ntil the curse is lifted, the centaurs exude a charnel stench, can't regain hit points, and can't eat or drink anything without making themselves sick. The centaurs are not spoiling for a fight and prefer to be left alone.

Four **dryad's** live in the smaller oak trees that encircle Grandfather Tree. They emerge from their trees when one or more characters approach within 50 feet of Grandfather Tree's base, demanding in Elvish that the characters leave at once. The dryads know nothing of the giant relic hidden among Grandfather Tree's roots and have no attachment to it. With a successful DC 14 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, a character can convince the dryads to let the party search for the relic and take it away. The check is made with disadvantage if the dryads can't understand the charac- 11:r's words. If the party conducts a search without the dryads' consent, the dryads attempt to charm the characters and command them to return whence they came. The dryads attack intruders who resist their charms or refuse to leave, calling on the centaurs to aid them (which the centaurs are more than happy to do).

Whenever a dryad is killed, one or more conjured animals rise up out of the ground within 30 feet of her and join the fray, acting on the dryad's initiative count. Roll on the Avenging Animals table to determine what appears. A conjured animal can distinguish enemies from allies, and it gains the benefit of Grandfather Tree's bless spell. It disappears after 1 hour, or when it drops to O hit points, or when it is dispelled (DC 15).

### **Avenging Animals**

| **`dice: d4`** | **Animal(s)** |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 brown bear's |
| 2 | 2 dire wolf's |
| 3 | 1 giant boar |
| 4 | 1 giant elk |
