## Overview
Kheldell is a fortified logging village on the north edge of [[Westwood]], in the shadow of the [[Sword Mountains]]. The people here are beholden to the mysterious Dusk Circle, a group of druids who reside in hermitages in the surrounding mountains and forest. Folk in Kheldell log, bunt, plant, and harvest when and where they are told.
