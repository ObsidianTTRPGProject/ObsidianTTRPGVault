# Shadowdale
![[Shadowdale Coat of Arms.png|left|150]] The Town of Shadowdale was an unwalled farming community situated within Shadowdale, in the Dalelands and was the largest population center of the dale.

Shadowdale was a farming community in the Dalelands, in north Faerûn. It was the home of the [[archmage]] Elminster Aumar and was the home of two of the Seven Sisters, Storm Silverhand and Syluné. Through its history, Shadowdale battled both Zhentarim and [[drow]] invasions. Due to the number of ruins in Shadowdale, it was a popular place for adventuring companies to settle.

### Politics
The ruler of Shadowdale was chosen by its inhabitants. This would be someone whom they held in high regard, and was usually an outsider to the dale and someone they regarded as a hero to the dale having provided a service. This was in contrast to other Dales where hereditary rule was common. The inhabitants of Shadowdale generally kept their own lands and freedoms, swearing fealty to the lord and helping the community only when outside threats became involved.

### Defense
Elminster was usually responsible for the defense of Shadowdale, but when he was away on trips, he left this task with Storm Silverhand.
