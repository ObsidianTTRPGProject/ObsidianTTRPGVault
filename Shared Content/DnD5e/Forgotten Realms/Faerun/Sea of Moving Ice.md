# Sea of Moving Ice
## Overview
The sea west of [[Icewind Dale]] is a maze of shifting ice sheets and icebergs. A few frozen islands are inhabited by tribes of Ice Hunters, a group of humans the Northlanders pushed toward the pole long ago. An armada of frost giant greatships under the command ofJarl Storvald hunts whales, walruses, and seals in these waters.

The Sea of Moving Ice is also the domain of several white dragons, the largest and most powerful of which are two **ancient white dragon**'s named Arauthator and Arveiaturace. Each dragon makes its lair inside a hollowed- out iceberg. Arauthator's iceberg, Oyaviggaton, has Northfolk barbarians living on it and is described in the adventure The Rise ofTiamat. Arveiaturace is known to hunt in lcewind Dale and might be encountered there (see the "[[Icewind Dale]]" section).

Characters who explore the Sea of Moving Ice in wintertime are subject to extreme cold temperatures (see the "Wilderness Survival" section in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
