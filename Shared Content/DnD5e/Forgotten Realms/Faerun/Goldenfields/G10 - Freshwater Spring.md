# G10 - Freshwater Spring
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

Northwest of the brewery is a natural spring that bubbles up to form a small lake. A river flows gently eastward, then northward, then eastward again, passing under two arching, moss-covered stone bridges before bleeding into the [[G11 - Rice Paddies|rice paddies]]. Frogs gather around the edge of the lake at night, filling the night air with a symphony of croaks.
