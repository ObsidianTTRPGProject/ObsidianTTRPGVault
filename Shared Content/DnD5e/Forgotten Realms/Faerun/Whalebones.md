# Whalebones
## Overview
Petty, warmongering kings rule over the small islands known as the Whalebones, so called because of the whale skeletons that litter the islands' beaches. Several of the larger islands are home to roes that the storm giants of [[Maelstrom]] use as mounts. The islanders leave treasure for the giants and food for the birds as tribute.
