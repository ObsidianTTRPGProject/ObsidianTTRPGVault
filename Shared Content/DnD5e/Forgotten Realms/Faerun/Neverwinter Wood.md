# Neverwinter Wood
## Overview
The forest east of [[Neverwinter]] seems to have a magical quality about it, or at least an air of mystical secrecy. [[Neverwinter]] Wood holds countless ruins and more than a few crumbling castles. The always-warm [[Neverwinter River]], which flows out of the wood, has its source deep beneath [[Mount Hotenow]], an active volcano in the northern reaches of the forest. The volcano last erupted some fifty years ago. Lava pouring down from the mountain burned a wide swath through [[Neverwinter]] Wood, destroying everything it touched. New trees have begun to grow where the ancient ones once stood, though the effect of the catastrophe is still plain for all to see.
