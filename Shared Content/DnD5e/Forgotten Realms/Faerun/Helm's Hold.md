# Helm's Hold

## Overview

Located a short distance southeast of Neverwinter, Helm's Hold is a fortified monastery enclosed on all sides by stone walls patrolled day and night by members of the Order of the Gilded Eye, a splinter sect of the Order of the Gauntlet. Helm's Hold is firmly under the Gilded Eye's control, and its members have taken Helm's doctrine of protection to extremes. The highminded inquisitors of the Gilded Eye are convinced that evil is rampant. They are determined to root out those under "demonic influence" and are quick to persecute anyone who doesn't act in accordance with their beliefs.

Within the walls of Helm's Hold are numerous residences surrounding a central district called the Heartward, wherein the characters can find a roomy tavern (called the Old Dirty Dwarf), several quiet hostels, and a bustling [[B7 - Marketplace|marketplace]]. A wooden hangman's scaffold stands in the center of the [[B7 - Marketplace|marketplace]], and on certain nights, when clouds obscure the waning moon, luminous ghosts wander around it, going about the business of the Jiving. Phantom vendors sell ephemeral apples at empty stands, ghost children play in the streets, and spirits hang one another on the scaffold. Some of the scenes appear to be reenactments of past events, whereas others have not occurred-at least, not yet. The ghosts speak mostly nonsense, but some of what they say might offer clues to past or future happenings.

Dominating the skyline is the Cathedral of Helm, a towering and inspiring edifice of pale gray stone that's visible for miles around. As much a fortress as a temple, the cathedral contains an orphanage, a hospital, an asylum, and training grounds for Gilded Eye initiates. Holy Watcher Qerria (LG female Tethyrian human **priest** of Helm), who presides over the cathedral, is determined to root out corruption wherever she finds it. Few doubt that her words carry the weight of Helm's divine wisdom. She is served by dozens of Gilded Eye inquisitors (male and female **cult fanatic's** of various alignments and ethnicities) who employ a host of **acolytes**, **assassins**, **guards**, **knights**, **spies**, and **veterans**. Evildoers and enemies of the Gilded Eye are rounded up and brought to Helm's Hold to face judgment. Those deemed to be under "demonic influence" or those who threaten the Gilded Eye are hanged, their bodies burned to ashes to prevent them from being raised from the dead.

## Suggested Encounter

Adventurers who enter Helm's Hold are watched closely by the Gilded Eye. However, as long as they don't stir up trouble, they have little to fear from the order, which prides itself on making visitors feel safe and protected. The Gilded Eye relies on trade to finance its activities, and adventurers are usually good for the settlement's economy. The Gilded Eye is also known to use adventurers to do its dirty work.

The leaders of the Gilded Eye have received reports of giant marauders in the region. Trained to deal with demonic threats, the order is less keen to face giants in battle. Zara Dalkor (LG female Illuskan knight of Helm) and her squire, Thora Tamlarrin (LN female Tethyrian half-elf guard), approach the characters and offer them the opportunity to help the Gilded Eye and the people of Helm's Hold, promising nothing in return except the Gilded Eye's gratitude. If the characters decline to help, Zara apologizes for taking up their time and reports back to her superiors.

If the characters express any interest in helping the Gilded Eye, Zara shares the following information:

- Scouts from Helm's Hold have spotted frost giants wandering the lands to the south.

- The frost giants have attacked and plundered several homesteads and caravans along the [[High Road]].

- The Gilded Eye wants the characters to find out where the giants are coming from.

Characters who accept the quest and head south for 10 miles spot a frost giant walking toward the coast. The giant recently attacked a caravan traveling north along the [[High Road]] and has 88 hit points remaining. He carries a sack stuffed with pillaged food as well as `dice: 1d4` mundane items (roll on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction). The giant fights to the death if he is attacked. If the characters follow the giant while keeping their distance, he leads them to a miles-long stretch of 100-foot-high cliffs. Anchored a half mile off the coast is a greatship (see the "Svardborg: General Features" sidebar in chapter 7, "Berg of the Frost Giants") with two giant-sized punts tethered to it. Three frost giants are aboard the ship. When the giant carrying the sack of food waves from the top of the cliffs, one of the giants aboard the ship climbs into a punt and rows it to shore, while the first giant climbs down the cliff to meet it. Most of the ship's crew is still plundering the mainland, so the ship isn't leaving anytime soon.

Sixteen frost giants have yet to return to the ship from their inland raids. If the characters hide aboard the ship or remain within sight of it, roll a `dice: d20` at the end of each hour that passes. On a roll of 17 or higher, `dice: 1d4` **frost giants** return and signal the ship to send a punt to shore. If no punt is available, the giants swim to the ship to find out what happened.

## Treasure

Characters who board the ship and defeat the giants find a ton of stolen foodstuffs, along with a dozen barrels of cheap ale of little value, twelve casks of expensive brandy (worth 300 gp each), 10,000 gp in mixed coinage, and `dice: 2d4` stolen art objects worth 750 gp each (roll on the appropriate table in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine each art object).

Each returning giant carries a sack stuffed with pillaged supplies as well as one mundane item, determined by rolling on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction. There is also a 25 percent chance of a sack containing `dice: 1d10` x 100 gp in mixed coinage.
