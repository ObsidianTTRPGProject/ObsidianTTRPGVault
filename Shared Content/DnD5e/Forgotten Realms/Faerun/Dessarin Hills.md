# Dessarin Hills
## Overview
The rugged, scruffy hills south of [[Yartar]] provide a safe haven for orcs, ogres, hill giants, manticores, and Uthgardt barbarians. Scattered throughout the Dessarin Hills are ancient dwarven ruins, crumbling towers, lost mines, and abandoned hunting lodges, any of which might contain monsters and other perils.
