# T16 - The Triboar Arms
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The [[Triboar]] Arms has burned to the ground twice and een rebuilt twice. Its owner and proprietor is Nemyth NG male tiefling **commoner**), a savvy businessman with a wicked smile. He likes to lean against the taproom doorway, drying and polishing a mug while nodding and smiling at passersby. His prices are reasonable, his staff cordial.

The tavern is a popular hangout for rangers and scouts, most of whom sell their services as wilderness guides. One of Nemyth's "regulars" is a friendly and capable guide named Zindra Winterbow (NG female half-elf scout), a member of the Emerald Enclave. She charges 10 gp per day for her services, regardless of the danger. She has noticed more and more hill giants, ogres, and Uthgardt barbarians wandering the hills around [[Triboar]] recently, and she warns adventurers leaving [[G6 - Town|town]] to be wary of them.
