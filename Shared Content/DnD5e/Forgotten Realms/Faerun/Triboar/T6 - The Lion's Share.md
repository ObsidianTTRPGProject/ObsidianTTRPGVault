# T6 - The Lion's Share
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

This building was recently purchased and refurbished by the Lionshield Coster, a merchant company based in the city of [[Yartar]]. Above the store's entrance hangs a polished shield emblazoned with the head of a stylized golden lion on a blue background.

Lionshields are not well liked in [[Triboar]], since [[Triboar]] and [[Yartar]] are bitter rivals, and few locals spend their money in this place. The store caters mostly to caravans and out-of-towners, selling provisions and animal fodder up front, and adventuring gear, armor, and weapons in back. Rooms on the second floor contain accommodations for the store's young proprietors, Alaestra Ulgar (NG female Illuskan human **commoner**) and **Narth Tezrin** (see appendix D), as well as a hidden vault containing their wealth. Alaestra and Narth run a successful business even in the face of local insults and mild harassment. They have an agreement with the lord protector not to sell weapons to anyone they think might be a threat to the [[G6 - Town|town]]. In exchange, the lord protector makes sure the store isn't victimized by vandals and local troublemakers.

**Treasure**. A closet-sized vault on the second floor is hidden behind a secret door that requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot. The vault contains an empty Heward's handy haversack and a locked iron strongbox that contains `dice: 3d10` x 10 gp in mixed coinage and a gray bag of tricks. Alaestra and Narth each carry a key to the strongbox. Its lock can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.
