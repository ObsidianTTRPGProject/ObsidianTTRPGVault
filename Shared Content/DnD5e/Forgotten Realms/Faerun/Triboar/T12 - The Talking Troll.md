# T12 - The Talking Troll
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The Troll is what Waterdhavians would call a dive-a dim, smelly, low-beamed place crammed with mismatched, battered old furniture and drunks. Part of the roof caught fire two summers ago and has yet to be repaired. The holes in the roof have allowed birds to build nests among the beams, and the floor and tables are speckled with bird droppings. The Troll's one redeeming feature is its large, well-stocked cellar. The owner and proprietor of the Troll is a struggling actor named Kaelen Sarssir (LN male Illuskan human commoner). He "inherited" the tavern after the previous owner fled in the wake of a scandal and has done the minimum amount of work necessary to keep it operational. Kaelen has dreams of turning the Troll into a theater, but he lacks the funds and the ambition to do so. He shares his dream with new patrons, hoping one or more of them might make a donation or otherwise sponsor the endeavor. Kaelen might even be persuaded to accept a business partner, provided there's little or no risk to him.

A **priest** of Helm named Silvarren Loomshank (LN male Illuskan human) sleeps in a drunken stupor in a corner of the common room, barely noticed by the Troll's other patrons. A lifelong resident of Neverwinter, he was "banished" by his superiors to the Allfaiths Shrine in [[Red Larch]]. He has yet to arrive there, choosing instead to stop and drown his sorrows in [[Triboar]]. He hasn't lost his faith in Helm, merely his faith in himself and his superiors. Consumed by self-pity, he sees himself as a victim of "temple politics." He has spent all of his traveling money and racked up a drinking debt of 5 gp. He won't leave [[Triboar]] until the debt is paid off. If the characters settle Silvarren's debt, they can persuade him to attend to his duties in [[Red Larch]] with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
