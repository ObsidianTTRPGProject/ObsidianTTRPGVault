## Description
Umberlee’s following in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] was established among the pirates and smugglers who first used the bay as a harbor. While many think of Umberlee as an evil goddess who delights in drowning sailors, the people of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] know her as a mother—an imperious and fickle one, but a mother nonetheless. The Water Queen’s House stands atop an enormous pier. The Queen’s Favor, a huge fountain that rises out of a 6-foot-deep pool, splashes above the harbor near the pier’s far end. Its central marble statuary depicts the stern of a life-sized sailing ship, sculpted to appear as if the vessel is sinking. Water spews from holes in its hull, and other streams regularly lash its deck. To power the fountain, Gondar engineers installed pipes between it and the bluffs’ reservoirs, such that the downhill descent pressurizes the stream. In public ceremonies, the ship’s deck serves as the temple’s altar.

Beyond the fountain, the temple crouches on the edge of the pier. The structure’s southern portion disappears into the water in a cascade of steps that waveservants (the temple’s priestesses) descend when they bring offerings to Umberlee. The Water Queen’s House is the city’s oldest temple, and seg ments of it—deep in sodden halls beneath the harbor’s ivater level—boast the oldest stonework still standing in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]. Only the waveservants have seen these ancient tunnels. Indeed, few Baldurians have even stepped inside the Water Queen’s House. When someone rings the temple door bell, two waveservants answer. One takes any offering inside, while the other delivers a short prayer beside the supplicant. Then the remaining priestess goes inside and shuts the doors once again.

Sailors, anglers, harborhands, merchants, seafar ers’ relatives, and everyone else who depends on the river or the sea offer up whatever they can spare, such as food, a few coppers, or an old ring. People who can give more usually do so, hoping their lavish gifts meet with Umberlee’s favor. The priestesses seemingly must receive a portion of this wealth, hut these mournful specters have never been spotted buying extravagant items when they’re out shopping. Most Baldurians believe that Umberlee takes away what they give to the temple, and that it’s bad luck to look at the water when waveservants descend into it with an offering.

Allandra Grey holds the title of Flood Tide in the temple, leading roughly a score of priestesses and following in the traditions of her mother and grand mother. The temple gains most of its clergy from among widowed females whose husbands were lost at sea or young girls orphaned by water-related trag edies. This practice strikes some observers as odd, but the priestesses (who can sympathize from simi lar experience) are glad to take in, feed, and clothe individuals who are suddenly rendered homeless.
