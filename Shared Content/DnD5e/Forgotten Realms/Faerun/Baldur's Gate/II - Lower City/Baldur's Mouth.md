# Baldur's Mouth
## Overview
**Type**: Facility, Building
#Location/Facility #Location/Building

Baldur’s Mouth, the city’s news carrier, provides a great service to people at every level of society. [[G6 - Town|Town]] criers and printed broadsheets are its two methods of spreading news.

## Description
The city has used Baldur’s Mouth many times to spread word of new laws that [[I - The Council of Four|the Council of Four]] passes, to broadcast holidays, and to communicate election results. Criers announce news of the affairs of kingdoms and nations throughout Faerñn, opening every declaration by shouting. “Harken, people of Bal dur’s Gate, to Baldur’s Mouth! The land changes, and Baldur would have his people know!”

Ettvard Needle, the son of a wealthy [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] tailor, founded the Mouth. After growing up watching [[I - Upper City|Upper City]] citizens compel his father to bend and grovel, Needle decided to give power to the people in the form of information. So he began paying lamp lads and lamp lasses to shout his stories of various injustices during the day. Since many of his employees were illiterate and had to memorize his news articles, Needle decided to teach them to read so he could give them written copies. As his expenses mounted, Needle sought out sponsors, which led to his attracting adver tising and diversifying his criers’ stories.

Baldur’s Mouth now earns its keep through advertising and is a functioning business. Formerly, to publicize his sponsors, criers would hand out wooden chits that afforded the recipient a discount when redeemed at a particular shop or merchant stall. Now, Needle uses several mechanical scribes that he pur chased from the Hall ofWonders to rapidly produce pamphlets and broadsheets that have advertisements in them.

### Using Baldur's Mouth
You can use the Gate’s news service to give your players a sense that city happenings are continuing in their absence while their characters are engaged elsewhere. You can also use Baldur’s Mouth to express how the heroes’ actions make news. For instance, if the characters are successful in aiding or thwarting one of the factions in a public incident, they could hear about the situation when they pass a crier in the streets. From time to time, the broadsheets of Baldur’s Mouth have included caricatures of important citizens, such as dukes or parliament members. As the adventure progresses, this practice of satirizing important people happens more often as the city veers out of control. Characters might even find flattering or unflattering images of themselves in the paper, depending on what they’ve been up to lately.

Baldur’s Mouth also has a darker element to it. Even though Needle dislikes [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] almost as much as he loathes [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]], he is a good friend and an admirer of [[Rilsa Rael]]. Her commitment to the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]]’s residents impresses him, and the newshound hopes to persuade [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] kingpin to help transform [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] from a predatory criminal organization into a mercenary citizens’ watch not unlike [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]]. He continues to support Rael through Baldur’s Mouth unless someone persuades him that she is causing more harm than good. That task wouldn’t be easy to accomplish, since Needle chooses not to acknowledge [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]’s role in the city’s growing instability.
