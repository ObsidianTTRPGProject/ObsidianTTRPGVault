# Felogyr's Fireworks (Fireworks Shop)
## Overview
Avery Sonshal sells pyrotechnics out of the four-story w’orkshop in the Steeps known as Felogyr’s Firew’orks. The business has been in his family since Felogyr Sonshal founded it and gave it an alliterative name more than a century ago. Customers often call Son shal by his ancestor’s name, and lie never bothers to correct them, believing there’s no sense in changing a recipe that works—especially when dealing with smokepowder.

#Goods-Type/Other

Felogyr’s Fireworks has retained a monopoly on smokepowder production in the city since the busi ness’s inception. Even the priests of Gond come to Felogyr’s to fill their needs. In exchange, Sonshal has never sold smokepow’der to anyone not of the temple of Gond or [[I - The Council of Four|the Council of Four]], except in the form of firew’orks. The shop does sell other items to a broad cli entele, specializing in torches and candle wicks w’hose flames burn in various hues; smoke and flash effects for stage productions; and various flashfire rubs, which are spread on meats before they’re set alight to add distinctive smoky flavors.

Torches that burn a rosy red are Sonshal’s topselling item. Baldurians use them to illuminate a traditional cobble party, or outdoor storytelling ses sion. When passersby see a rose torch lighting a street corner, an alley, or a courtyard, they recognize that the symbol signifies an opportunity to hear and tell tales of all kinds. The stories can be true or fiction. By custom, cobble parties are quiet and polite affairs that do not involve drinking or music.

## Relationships
Sonshal has a plump, young-looking countenance and shaves his head. If not for his thick, muttonchop sideburns, he might be considered baby-faced. A wizard and an [[Alchemist|alchemist]] who is a member of the Council’s Eminent Fellowship of Healers, Sonshal detests the presence ofnonmagical hangers-on in [[VI - The Guild|the guild]], such as botanists and surgeons.
