# The Splurging Sturgeon (Tavern)
## Overview
The Splurging Sturgeon struggled as a threadbare tavern for decades until its most recent owner, Hennut Griot, took its humorous name seriously. Originally from Ormpur, Griot discovered that her traditional fish dishes were too spicy for the local palate, so she hired Baldurian cooks to teach her Sword Coast reci pes. After she mastered those and earned a stellar reputation, she expanded her menu to include dishes of her own for locals to try out. That success led Griot to hire a series of cooks from many lands, and from them she learned to prepare exotic fish fare.
