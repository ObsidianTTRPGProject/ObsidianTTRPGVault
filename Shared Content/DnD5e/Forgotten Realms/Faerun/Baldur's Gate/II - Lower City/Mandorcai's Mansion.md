## Description
This structure appeared out of nowhere. fully built and staffed, overnight on a vacant lot. For several tendavs afterward, citizens gos siped about Mandorcai, the eccentric, magic-wielding builder of the place, and influential residents courted him, eager to retain the services of such a powerful wizard.

Mandorcai then vanished from public life. No one heard from him except through invitations he sent to various individuals. These peculiar missives were written in silver atop black paper folded into the shape of a pentagon. Those who entered the mansion to keep their appointments were never seen again. After a handful of such disappearances, a Flam ing Fist squad invaded the building. Only two of its members emerged, and they spoke of shifting rooms, oppressive chants, and blood-soaked chambers. [[I - The Council of Four|The Council of Four]] would like to have the mansion torn down, but no laborers are willing to touch the place. Since the building does not appear to be dangerous as long as no one goes inside it, the dukes have not pressed the issue. Mandorcai and his servants are still missing, but the odd little black invitations occa sionally appear on people’s doorsteps when no one is looking.
