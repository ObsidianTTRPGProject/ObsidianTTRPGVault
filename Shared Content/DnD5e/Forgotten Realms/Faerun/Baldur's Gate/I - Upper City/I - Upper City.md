### Overview of Upper City

[[g5crfst4.gr1.png|open outside]]

## Description
The Upper City exudes wealth. Its buildings shutters and doors bear vibrant colors and are smartly main tained. Its streets are wide, and its terrain is nearly flat. At night, the magic lamps that hang from ornate arms extending streetward from most buildings keep its avenues well lit. Rain runs off raised roads into drains, rather than pooling or flowing down streets, and sewers carry away waste. Flowering plants that hang from windows and climbing walls—and a ban on smelly businesses—help to sweeten the Upper City’s air.

Every Upper City citizen is either a patriar; a servant of a patriar. Often coming from a proud line of retainers to the nobility; a Watch member, often also a hereditary post; or an affluent business owner. Upper City establishments serve [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]] and other wealthy customers almost exclusively. This part of the city has few inns and no public taverns. Patri ars do their drinking at home, in private clubs, or on overnight soirees into the [[II - Lower City|Lower City]]. Few doors in the Upper City are open at night, and the streets are devoid of activity except for Watch patrols.

## Profile
The Upper City of Baldur's Gate is the enclosed haven of the city's nobility- [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]]. Sitting atop their hill, [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]] look down on the rest of Baldur's Gate in every real sense, wielding their wealth and influence to push [[I - The Council of Four|the Council of Four]] to protect their lifestyle. Though at one time a wealthy merchant or powerful adventurer might hope to advance to the ranks of [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]], there is no longer room, physically or otherwise, for the class of the Upper City to grow. Now, only those born into the patriar families inhabit the manors of this oldest part of Baldur's Gate. The poorest among these go so far as to sell furnishings and decorations from inside their homes in order to keep up appearances with their fellow patriars.  

Most would say that the lives of patriars are marked by luxury and decadence, and for a great many of them, this is likely true. However, some families do make an honest attempt at improving the city, and nearly every family has at least one member who engages in major commerce- no matter one's heritage, everyone must have coin in order to eat. There is but one nonhuman family among [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]], the dwarven Shattershields, who have been in Baldur's Gate for long enough that they are just as accomplished as their human peers at looking down on the rest of the citizenry.  

A number of gates divide the Upper City from the [[II - Lower City|Lower City]], but the one to note is the famous Baldur's Gate, from which the city takes its name. Trade passes only through this gate, and is taxed by the city-despite the fact that it was just such taxes that led to the city's being overthrown by its first dukes and the [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] enclosed by its ring wall. The other gates exist solely for the convenience of [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]] and their retinues. Any who aren't in the presence of a patriar, wearing a patriar's livery, or bearing a letter of proof of employment by a patriar must use Baldur's Gate to pass between the Upper and Lower Cities. Bear this in mind when trying to sneak from one part of the city to the next.

## Points of Interest
### The Gates of Upper City
The Old Wall, the original wall built at Bal duran’s behest, contains the Upper City. Six gates pierce it.

The Black Dragon Gate protects the northern entrance into the city and is named for the black dragon head a victo rious knight displayed there. The head is long gone now, but a stone replacement projects from the wall above the inner gate’s arch in honor of the old trophy.

Originally, the only gate leading to the harbor was [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]], the passage that gave the city its name. It is still the only gate in the wall segment separating the Upper and Lower cities through which normal traffic and trade is permitted. This segment is typi cally referred to as “the Old Wall.” even though the original wall enclosed the entire Upper City. Ironically, despite the gate’s history as the flashpoint of the tax revolt that established the dukes’ control, non patriar merchants and travelers passing through the gate are subject to tolls and taxes. [[V - The Watch|The Watch]] always guards [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]], and [[V - The Watch|the Watch]] and [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] use the site to transfer prisoners destined either for trial in the [[High Hall (The Ducal Palace)|High Hall]] or confinement in [[The Seatower of Balduran|the Seatower of Balduran]].

Sea Gate, Manor Gate, Gond Gate, and Heap Gate, the other four Old Wall entrances, are smaller structures created for [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]]’ convenience after the [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] was enclosed. Those who are not in the company of a patriar, not wearing a patriar’s house livery, or not bearing a patriar’s letter of employment must use [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]].
