## Description
A statue of a powerful warrior in plate armor stands in [[The Wide (Open Marketplace)|the Wide]]. Far from being the typical grim guardian, this warrior wears an enthusiastic grin and cradles a hamster in his hands. The late Orburt Lewel, an eccentric textiles merchant, erected the statue about seventy years ago.

According to legend, the featured figure is Minsc, a dull-witted but brave warrior of Rashemen who saved Level’s life from some forgotten danger. The hamster is Boo. a pet that Minsc referred to as a “giant pygmy space hamster.” The quirky statue is a favorite landmark and meet ing spot in the ever-changing sea of market stalls, both because it’s easy to spot and because [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] loves its peculiar characters.
