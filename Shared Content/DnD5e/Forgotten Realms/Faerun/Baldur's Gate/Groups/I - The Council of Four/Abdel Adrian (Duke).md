Among Baldurians, Duke Abdel Adrian is universally considered to be the city’s greatest hero, second only to Balduran the Brave. The wizard Gorion raised Adrian in Candlekeep, but Adrian, a child of Bhaal, was swept up in a series of deadly events orchestrated by his half-siblings, the Bhaalspawn. Adrian’s life as an adventurer became noto rious when he saved [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] from the Iron Throne’s -- machinations and killed his half-brother Sarevok to avert a war with Amn.

## Story
Adrian fought countless battles against people seeking to use his Bhaalspawn blood for nefarious purposes. Baldurians know little of these adventures, and few people alive today comprehend the meaning of Adrian’s status as a Bhaalspawn. Most people believe the God of Murder is long dead and, if they know anything of Adrian’s story, that their beloved duke made certain Bhaal remained dead. Following his adventuring days, Adrian lived for a time in contemplation in Candlekeep. He eventually decided to settle in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]], which had become his second home.

Adrian joined [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] as a private and quickly ascended through the mercenary company’s ranks. [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] citizens respected his courage and dashing ways, and [[III - Outer City|Outer City]] residents loved him for his charitable works. After Valarken killed [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]]’s marshal, who was also a duke, Adrian replaced him in both positions. He originally tried to turn down his ducal nomination, but public acclaim was too strong, and the military leader reluctantly accepted the post.

Adrian is more than a century old, and his divine heritage has kept him well preserved. He appears to be in his sixties, and his body retains the strength of youth. At nearly 7 feet in height, Adrian towers over most Baldurians. Black hair frames his unrelenting eyes and slightly wizened face. Unlike other dukes, he wears comfortable, plain garments and shuns jewelry. The only time he dresses as a state official is for parades.

Adrian rarely speaks at council meetings. But when he does, his voice for moderation carries tremendous weight. Most days, Duke Adrian walks the city’s streets, talking with citizens; helping them in their daily labors; and offering charity, an encouraging word, or a stern reprimand as needed. He sometimes seems grim and lost in thoughts, perhaps of days past, but [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] marshal and Council of Four duke is also known to break out in great guffaws when the occasion arises.
