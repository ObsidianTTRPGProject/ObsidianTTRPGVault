Once a vigorous and formidable politician, Belynne Stelmane recently suffered a seizure and a long period of unconsciousness, after which she awoke a changed woman. Half of her handsome face is paralyzed now, and an uncertain gait and a constant tremor in her left arm have replaced her once legendary grace. Stel mane’s mind also suffered. Even though she continues to perform her ducal duties and jealously guards her privileges, her thinking seems slow, and her words come even more slowly.

## Story
Duke Stelmane leads the [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] branch of the Knights of the Shield, a secret society of Sword Coast nobles, merchants, and traders that uses infor mation passed among its members for their mutual enrichment. She has managed to hold onto that posi tion because, in the privacy of her home, she remains a skilled negotiator when it comes to commerce and continues to effectively influence city businesses and acquire more wealth and property.

The duke is conservative and unimaginative in all matters except for trade strategies and financial maneuvers. She has made few pronouncements or controversial court judgments since her illness. Due to her wealth and business connections, most Gate power players consider her a valuable ally or a pawn rather than a target.

She is indeed a pawn. A mind flayer provoked the duke’s “seizure” when it took mental possession of her, and the illithid kept Stelmane comatose for many days as it stood invisibly at her bedside to psychically interrogate her. Duke Stelmane’s will remains strong, however. Since she awakened, her mind has been a constant battleground between her own psyche and the illithid—except when she conducts business on behalf of the Knights of the Shield. At these times, the illithid’s interests and her own converge, and she regains much of her normal vigor.

Stelmane does not know what the illithid’s ultimate aims are. Nor has she found a way to break its grip on her sufficiently to signal for aid. She has learned that the more she attempts to exercise her will, the less capable she appears to others, a perception that ultimately threaten her status. So, behind her distant expression and stuttering words, the duke is ever watchful for something that might break the stalemate with the evil entity inside her.
