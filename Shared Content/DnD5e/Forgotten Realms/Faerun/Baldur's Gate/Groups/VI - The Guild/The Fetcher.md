# The Fetcher
## Profile
The Fetcher is an unflappable, obese, middle-aged man named Osgur Hallorn. This walrus-mustached puppetmaster runs gangs ofstreet urchins as spies and couriers. The latter fetch and deliver items for the Fetcher’s high-paying clients. The Fetcher is a man whose big head, hands, and shoul ders make his bulging belly not seem so protuberant. He has a large, beaky nose. Half his scalp is covered in messy, dark curls; the other half is naked except for a gnarled, old burn scar. He rarely shows fear or anger, preferring to be jovial; he drawls calmly in the face of danger. The choreographer of urchins spends most hours each day in [[The Undercellar|the Undercellar]], where he has a back-corner office. Gangs of waifs and ras cals drift about the city doing his bidding, which includes spying on figures both prim and feral and delivering items that range from flowers to rubies.

The Fetcher is always armed and protected. His walking stick fires darts from one end when he triggers certain studs. Shadowing their provider, the man who has kept them fed and clothed when no one else would, are a score of acrobati cally vicious street youths who carry knives fashioned from glass shards. While the Fetcher is in his office, a dozen or so devoted cats perch on an unlit lamp wheel above his head and pounce on anyone who menaces him. The Fetcher is genuinely kind unless he is forced to be ruthless. Usually rumpled and sweating, he drinks a prodi gious amount of wine daily without becoming inebriated. Some folk believe that [[The Undercellar|the Undercellar]] serves him rosewater in wine bottles, so he’s actually sober.

The Fetcher is a Guild kingpin in the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]. He main tains his status by squatting on [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]’s best resource for its actions in the swanky portion of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]—a secret tunnel beneath the Old Wall, which spans the dividing line between the Lower and Upper cities. The exact path through the cellars and sewers of the passageway is known only to the Fetcher, a handful of his most trusted operators, [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]], and (unknown to the Fetcher) [[Rilsa Rael]]. The Fetcher or one of his operators brings other Guild members through the tunnel blindfolded and deliberately takes false turns to confuse them.

The Fetcher has no ambition to rise higher in [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]. He measures his wealth in terms of influence, not coin. He’s addicted to information and needs to be thought of as “in the know,” someone folk listen to and respect. He often orders his gangs to aid a promising prospect on a short-term or long-term basis as an investment in the person’s future and to gain the individual’s good favor. He lives in the cel lars of more than a dozen city buildings he owns, rotating between them as he sees fit, and none of his tenants have any idea their landlord has secret rooms beneath their own.
