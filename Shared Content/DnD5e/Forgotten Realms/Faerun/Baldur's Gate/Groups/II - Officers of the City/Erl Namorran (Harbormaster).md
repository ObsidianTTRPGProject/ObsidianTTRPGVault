The Harbormaster of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] is Erl Namorran, a stern, no-nonsense, by-the-book guy who served with distinction in [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] before retiring. As the befitting jest about him states, “Only once did he ever make a joke, and that unknowingly.” At that time, it is said, Namorran unwittingly whispered an inappro priate comment about Evelyn Silvershield’s corset to Duke Adrian during [[Torlin Silvershield (Duke)|High Artificer]]’s speech at a state event. Adrian’s ensuing uproarious laugh ter brought the patriar’s speech to a halt, but Adrian never disclosed what triggered the outburst. Shortly thereafter, at the next Council of Four meeting, Adrian recommended Namorran to fill the open position of harbormaster.

Namorran is highly intelligent and a capable accountant, which makes him well suited for the post. At the same time, he lacks social polish and willingly sacrifices common sense when it contradicts the rules.
