# Silvermoon Pass
## Overview
A road traverses the hills northeast of Silverymoon, providing passage between two mountain ranges and then southward to [[Sundabar]]. Silverymoon Pass has seen little traffic since [[Sundabar]] was overrun during the War of the [[Silver Marches]]. The rotted corpses of hundreds of ores lie strewn on either side of the road-grisly evidence of how close Silverymoon came to suffering the same fate as [[Sundabar]].
