# Hawk's Nest
## Overview
Hawk's Nest is a fortified settlement that overlooks Silverymoon Pass, built to defend the pass against ore hordes and other threats, thus protecting Silverymoon's eastern flank. Perched atop a rocky crag and surrounded by high battlements, Hawk's Nest is under the protection of the Order of the Gauntlet. High stone walls enclose a keep and a densely packed village that includes three small temples (dedicated to Helm, Torm, and Tyr), a blacksmith, a leatherworker, a caravan supplier, a rough-and-tumble tavern (the Spiked Gauntlet), and two cozy yet spacious inns (the Hawk's Roost and the Inn of the Silver Sword).

The Lord of Hawk's Nest is Arthus Cavilos (LG male Damaran human **knight** of Tyr), a member of the Order of the Gauntlet. His wife, Lady Fenris Agathonn (LG female Damaran human **mage**), is the great grand niece of Lord Taern Horn blade of Silverymoon. Arthun and Fenris have two spirited daughters, Lavencia and Eryl; one is training to be a wizard, the other a knight ofTyr like her father.

Lord Cavilos raises **hippogriffs**, which the knights of Hawk's Nest train as mounts and use to patrol the trade road between Silverymoon and [[Sundabar]]. Characters who are looking for an expeditious means of travel can petition Lord Cavilos to ferry them to their destination on the backs of hippogriffs. If the characters impress upon him the urgency of their mission, Lord Cavilos commands his fellow knights to fly the characters where they need to go, then return to Hawk's Nest with the hippogriffs. A hippogriff carrying a knight and one other rider must rest for 1 hour for every 3 hours it flies, and can travel about 54 miles per day.

## Suggested Encounter
When fire giants attack an armored wagon heading east to [[Sundabar]], knights on hippogriffs are forced to swoop down, rescue the survivors, and deliver them back to Hawk's Nest. The characters learn about the attack when the knights return with the survivors. They also find out that the armored wagon was transporting wages to workers who are rebuilding [[Sundabar]]'s defenses, which were destroyed during the War of the [[Silver Marches]]. Characters can show their valor by undertaking a quest to retrieve the stolen wages, which were kept in two locked iron strongboxes. While traveling east along the trade road, the characters come upon the wreckage of the armored wagon. From there they can follow fire giant tracks heading north into the mountains. Several hours later, they come upon two **fire giants** and two **hell hounds**. Each giant carries a sack that contains one of the iron strongboxes. The giants have broken the Jocks off them, leaving them unlocked.

If the characters return the strongboxes to Hawk's Nest or deliver them to [[Sundabar]], Lord Cavilos is impressed. If the party includes a paladin or a cleric of good alignment who isn't already a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, Lord Cavilos offers that character membership in the order. If the party already includes any members of the order, Lord Cavilos offers each of them a knighthood and a hippogriff mount. He also invites all party members to attend a dinner with his family, during which Lord Cavilos regales his honored guests with unexaggerated tales of victorious battles he fought during the War of the [[Silver Marches]].

## Treasure
Each strongbox contains 500 gp. Each giant's sack also holds ld4 mundane items, determined by rolling on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction.
