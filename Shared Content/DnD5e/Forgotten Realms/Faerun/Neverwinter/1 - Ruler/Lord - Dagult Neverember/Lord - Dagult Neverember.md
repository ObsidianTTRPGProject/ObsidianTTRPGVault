Lord of Waterdeep - Lord Protector of [[Neverwinter]]

## Profile
**Ideals:** Moderation, responsibility (“The commoners need strong leaders to protect them—and to do what must be done even when it is distasteful.”)

**Interaction Traits:** Honest

**Pledged Resources:** [[Neverwinter]] conscript troops, and mercenaries from around the world Lord Neverember holds many titles and wears several crowns. During the first council, he is the Open Lord of Waterdeep, the Lord Protector of [[Neverwinter]], and leader of the Lords’ Alliance. He looks the part of such an impressively titled figure: tall and broad-shouldered, with a thick beard, a wild mane of hair, and a forceful manner. Rarely seen without his hand around a glass of strong spirits, he is a master manipulator and looks and behaves as a king should.

Strong and decisive, Dagult acts always for the good of his subjects and realm—and in doing so, has consistently built up his own power and wealth. Unfortunately for him, the [[Masked Lords of Waterdeep]] have recently chosen to replace him as Open Lord. Laeral Silverhand, his successor, claims her title in the second council meeting.

Dagult demands order and rewards discipline, but he is pragmatic and driven by results above all else. He knows that nothing comes without effort, and sacrifices must be made when necessary. Tireless in his actions, he never stops until he has achieved his goals. He will use any means at his disposal, as long as those means are legally justifiable—even when such justification must be “rediscovered” from long-forgotten or ignored laws.

In the first council meeting, Lord Dagult’s resources have been spread thin between the massive investments he’s made in rebuilding [[Neverwinter]] and in maintaining dominance in Waterdeep. He strongly supports the members of the Lords’ Alliance pooling resources, because he worries that neither of his investments can survive the coming catastrophe without assistance. This changes by the second council. Though losing Waterdeep allows him to consolidate his strength, Dagult resents Laeral for taking his position. He avoids letting his feelings cloud his judgment, however, intent on showing that he is a more fitting leader by backing the adventurers and taking a firm leadership role in the council.
