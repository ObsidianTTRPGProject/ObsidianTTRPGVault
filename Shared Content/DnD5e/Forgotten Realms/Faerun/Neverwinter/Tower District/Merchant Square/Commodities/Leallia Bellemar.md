Leallia Bellemar

Manipulative Charmer

*“You may think you have won, but have only done my bidding without knowing it.”*

**Appearance:** Leallia is dangerously attractive. She has brown hair and wears a coy, devious smile.

**Roleplaying:** Leallia works hands-on, but often her true motives go unnoticed. She is a chameleon who molds herself into the best tool to manipulate her current target.

**Personality:** She is confident, cunning, mysterious, and seductive. However, Leallia’s strongest personality trait is her boundless devotion to her hidden goals.

**Motivation:** Leallia seeks change in the world, but she keeps the true reasons hidden behind layers of obfuscation.

**Background:** Leallia is a manipulator, working behind the scenes or charming her way into social positions where she can bend the ear and will of the high-ranking. She is often seen on the arms of wealthy royalty or whispering in the ear of politicians. But Leallia’s reach is far wider, and her resources seem near limitless. When some treachery of hers has been discovered within a realm and she has been chased out of it, she often appears elsewhere with even bigger plans. She is known to wield many magical devices, but if she is a magic user herself she keeps it well hidden. Many of her schemes revolve around the manipulation of bloodlines, and some who have crossed her speculate that she is immortal or

long-lived. These might just be rumors she has seeded herself to obscure her true motives.

**Traits:** *(JA) Charming, mysterious, power hungry, white collar*
