Barley Trowbridge

Garrulous Innkeeper

*“Welcome to my inn! Relax by the fire while I fetch you a spiced ale. Tell me a tale, and the drink’s on me.”*

**Appearance**: People expect innkeepers to be portly, but Trowbridge is slender. His eyes are surrounded by laughter lines, and he makes up for his lack of girth with a thick, wooly brown beard that’s wider than his head.

**Roleplaying**: Trowbridge comes off like a kindly old uncle, with a ready smile and a story for every occasion. He’s an exceptionally good listener.

**Personality**: Outgoing, friendly, warm, and incredibly hard to dislike, Trowbridge is generous and charitable without being naïve. Underneath all that, he can be quite ruthless.

**Motivation**: He likes to be the center of attention. If he scents a good story, he’ll do whatever it takes to ferret it out—and he’s always on the lookout for saleable information.

**Background**: Trowbridge (Barley to his friends) is the innkeeper who knows everyone and everything. Garrulous by nature, he’s immediately likable. It’s not an act, but nor is Trowbridge exactly what he appears. He gathers information from all corners of the kingdom, gently squeezing it out of his guests and selling it to those he likes or respects; the fee is often an exchange of information. He’s no stranger to skullduggery and smuggling, and he puts the bonds of friendship over the law. If the PCs need something done, and if Trowbridge likes them, chances are he can help.

**Traits:** *(MR) Business, charming, criminal, merchant, scholar*
