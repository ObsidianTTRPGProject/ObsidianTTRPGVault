Roberto Graviani

Alchemical Don Juan

*“Transcend mortal life and live purified as your core elements!”*

**Appearance:** Roberto stands 5’8”, with olive skin and black hair that still shows only traces of gray. He’s fit as a farmer with calloused though often ink-stained hands.

**Roleplaying:** He’s impatient with lesser men, supremely confident in his own virtues and magnetism—particularly to women. He charms the most attractive women with a practiced mix of compliments, foreign sayings, and perceptive readings.

**Personality:** Doctor Graviani loves a good glass of red wine and savors his food; most meetings are over a glass of wine or a meal. Several women keep assignations with him, thrilling at his practiced charms.

**Motivation:** Competition is eternal and Roberto hates coming in second to anyone. His peers are targets of speculation and rumor, their discoveries diminished by Graviani’s telling, and their wives seduced.

**Background:** As a youth, his foreign heritage marked him as different, leading to taunting and fights. Now he wears his difference proudly, assigning much of his success to his ancestors and upbringing. His exotic features and relative wealth make him popular as a dinner guest—or host. Recent alchemical experimentation bore fruit; his formulae allow him to conjure elementals with the personality and lifespan of host animals— though the process consumes the animal. Human-powered elementals should work even better...

**Traits:** *(SM) Aggressive, occult, scientist*
