Erik Lemore

Cynical Veteran

*“Oh, they’ll come alright. And when they do, I’ll be there to watch them get ya!”*

**Appearance**: This broad-shouldered man has chiseled features and dark stubble underneath dark, sunken eyes. His chest piece is dented and devoid of luster; the nicks upon his sword betray years of use.

**Roleplaying**: He looks defeated, his head hung and his voice weary. Erik constantly picks at his fingernails, and times of great stress will leave them bleeding. He’ll curl his fingers and use the pain to keep himself alert at night.

**Personality**: Erik has seen enough battle to know how things are going to end. He’s dark and brooding, commenting on the worst of things. He’s not one to give up, but he sets expectations low with his cynical outlook. He’s typically ready for the worst-case scenario.

**Motivation**: He only hopes to live through the next trial. He hopes he’s wrong and things don’t go as bad as he expects, but just in case, he’s made sure he’ll survive.

**Background**: Years of fighting have dulled his conscience and the gallons of blood he has spilled have dampened his morale. That said, he’s a skilled fighter and worthy to have at your side in a pinch, but his constant prattling and cynicism can grate on anyone’s nerves. Interestingly enough, his approach does make it easier to plan an opponent’s likely path of attack.

**Traits**: *(DM) Adventurer, aggressive, warrior*
