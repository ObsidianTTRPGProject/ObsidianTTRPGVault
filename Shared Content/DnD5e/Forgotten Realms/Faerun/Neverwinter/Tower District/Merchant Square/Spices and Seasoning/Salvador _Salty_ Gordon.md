**SALVADOR “SALTY” GORDON**

*Male human retired sailor*

<u>Appearance</u>

Time has made an old man of Salty, a retired sailor whose days at sea live only in his memories now. It’s unclear just how old he *really* is – he still has most of his scraggly, albeit gray, hair atop his head, and he is always clean shaven. He prefers to wear simple garments and his old sailor’s jacket, and perpetually smells of pipe smoke and alcohol.

<u>A Sailor’s Life</u>

Salty lives a life of nostalgia. When encountered, the old man is quick to describe how much “better” things were in his time, and he’s never too reserved to hold back his loathe for new things and young people.

<u>Personality, Quirks, & Memorable Features</u>

Salvador Gordon earned his nickname “Salty” from a life at sea, indeed there was a time when he had the strength of youth and could brave such affairs. However, the years have turned him bitter and crotchety, making his nickname all the more appropriate.

If there’s one thing Salty still does well, it’s giving lectures to young people about how easy they have things in life, why things were better in his day, and the “real” way to do things.

Although he’s difficult to deal with, Salty does have a few shreds of human empathy remaining. He may claim to not care about others, however, and makes sure to keep any kindnesses he affords secret.
