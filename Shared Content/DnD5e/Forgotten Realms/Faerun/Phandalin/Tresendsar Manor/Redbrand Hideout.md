# Redbrand Hideout
## Overview
> [!note] Read-Aloud
> Hanging above the front door of this modest trading post is a sign shaped like a wooden shield with a blue lion painted on it.
> 

This building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of [[Yartar]], over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to [[Phandalin]] and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hard hit by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in [[Phandalin]] never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)

The master of the [[Phandalin]] post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named Linene Graywind. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn't know who is responsible.

In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. (For prices, see "Adventuring Gear" in the rulebook.) Linene has a few scruples, however, and won't sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the [[G6 - Town|town]]. Among those with whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid the Sleeping Giant tap house.

**Recovered Goods**. If the characters return the stolen goods found in area 8 of the [[Cragmaw Hideout|Cragmaw hideout]] (or if they left the goods but reveal where they can be found), Linene gives them a reward of 50 gp and promises to help the adventurers any way she can.

For Sale: Adventuring Supplies
