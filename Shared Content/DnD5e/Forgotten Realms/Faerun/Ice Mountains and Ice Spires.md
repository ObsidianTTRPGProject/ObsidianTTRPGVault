# Ice Mountains and Ice Spires
## Overview
The Ice Mountains and the Ice Spires are reckoned by some to be the easternmost extent of the [[Spine of the World]], rather than being mountain ranges in their own right. The difference is academic, since all three areas have soaring peaks, permanent snowpack at all but the lowest elevations, and monster infestations. White dragons commonly vie for dominion in this region.
