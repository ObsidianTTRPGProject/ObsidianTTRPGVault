# Southwood
## Overview
Hemmed in by the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] to the north and west, the [[High Moor]] to the south, and the [[Graypeak Mountains]] to the east, the Southwood has the same variety of trees found in the [[High Forest]], without the [[High Forest]]'s mysterious reputation. Hunters and rangers from [[Grayvale]] like to travel these woods.
