# Uluvin
## Overview
This dry, dusty village is located south of the [[High Forest]], on the old [[Iron Road]] between [[Womford]] and [[Secomber]]. A branch of the road turns northeast and heads toward Unicorn Run, a gently flowing river that pours out of the [[High Forest]].

## Suggested Encounter
Two teenage cattle ranchers named Albie Grizlow and Leshonna Daar (CE male and female Tethyrian human commoners) mounted on riding horses intercept the characters as they approach within five miles of Uluvin. The teenagers tell the party that the village has fallen to hill giants and goblins and that many villagers have taken refuge in the nearby forest.

Characters can give the village a wide berth, or they can deal with the threat. If they get within three miles of the village, they start to see scattered farmsteads surrounded by dry fields. At each farmstead are `dice: 3d6` goblins; they either are searching the [[C - Cottage|cottage]] and barn for treasure, chasing chickens and swine in the field, or dancing around ld4 tied-up prisoners (commoners). The goblins have covered their captives' heads with old buckets, flowerpots, and feedbags so that they can't see. There is a 50 percent chance that an ogre is also present, trying to catch a pig or lift a cow and take it back to Grudd Haug (see chapter 5, "Den of the Hill Giants"). The goblins and the ogre are too distracted to notice the adventurers if they stick to the road. The ogre and most of the goblins have no treasure, but the goblin leader at each farmstead carries a trinket (roll on the Trinkets table in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook).

If the characters enter the village, they see dusty wood-frame buildings with tall facades lining the [[Iron Road]]. Three hill giants are outside in plain view, overturning wagons, smashing through clay-tiled rooftops with their greatclubs, and stuffing into their sacks anything that catches their eye. Characters can easily take these hill giants by surprise. An inn and saloon called the Black Bull's Tail stands at the intersection where the road branches. Two more hill giants have ripped through the inn's facade and destroyed most of the furnishings, including the stairs leading up to the second floor, and are in the midst of gorging themselves on food and ale. If they hear sounds of combat outside, they investigate, hurling benches, rain barrels, and whatever else they can find in lieu of rocks.

## Treasure
Each hill giant has a sack containing `dice: 2d6` x 100 cp and ld4 mundane items, determined by rolling on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction.

Once the monsters are driven out, the characters can travel north to the edge of the [[High Forest]] and let the villagers know that it's safe to return. If they do so, a grateful old widow named Zoranda Heller (LG female Chondathan commoner) gives them a ring of protection that her late husband, a rancher, found in a field.
