Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders, was a large underground drow city-state in the Upper Northdark. Menzoberranzan was possibly the most well known drow city in Faerûn. It was the home of Drizzt Do'Urden, and many of his early adventures dealt with the political intrigue and characters of the city.

It was located in the Upper Northdark, about 3.2km (2 miles) below the Surbrin Valley, between the [[Moonwood]] and the [[Frost Hills]]. It was quite close to [[Mithral Hall]] and was connected through tunnels to that settlement. Other tunnels led to the surface, namely in the [[Moonwood]] and on the western edge of the [[High Forest]]. Drygully Tunnel was a tunnel leading from [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]] near Menzoberranzan to the surface
