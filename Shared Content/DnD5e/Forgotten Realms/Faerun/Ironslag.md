# Ironslag
## Overview
Millennia ago, the giants of Ostoria used this great forge to craft weapons and armor. When the giants' empire fell, Ironslag was abandoned. A fire giant chief named Duke Zalto has recently reoccupied Ironslag and seeks to reignite its adamantine forge. See chapter 8, "Forge of the Fire Giants," for more information on this location.
