Durnan (NG male Illuskan fighter 18) is a gruff, burly, russet-haired man, close-mouthed and prudent. He hates unfairness and injustice, but is tolerant of the differing interests of others - at least until they unsheathe a weapon in his inn, whereupon he draws his longsword on the spot.

Durnan is a retired fighter born in the remote North who spent his youth wandering the Savage Frontier, battling monsters and their ilk. He is an old friend of Mirt the Moneylender, and the duo were the first in modern-times to explore Undermountain, emerging in the Year of the Broken Helm (1302 DR) as rich men. While Mirt used share of their plunder to purchase his mansion on the southern slopes of Mount Waterdeep, Durnan built an inn, the Yawning Portal over the ruins of Halaster's long-vanished tower and now dwells there with his wife, [Mhaere Dryndilstann](http://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/organizations/waterdeep3.shtml#mhaere), and their daughter. As overseer of the primary open route into Undermountain, secret Lord of Waterdeep, and secret leader of the [Red Sashes](http://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/organizations/waterdeep10.shtml#redsash), Durnan finds himself involved in most events of import to affect the City of Splendors, a role for which he is well suited.
