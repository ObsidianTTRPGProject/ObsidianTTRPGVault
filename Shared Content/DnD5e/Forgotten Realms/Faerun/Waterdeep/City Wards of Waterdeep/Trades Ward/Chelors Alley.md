# Chelors Alley
## Overview
This short passage runs due west from the Court of the White Bull. Lit each night by many lamps set in the windows of the upstairs home of the man it is named for (a merchant who just loves candles), it is used as a rendezvous by those who need light enough to read by (to check maps or contracts, for instance), and by city watch and city guard patrols who need to examine evidence.
