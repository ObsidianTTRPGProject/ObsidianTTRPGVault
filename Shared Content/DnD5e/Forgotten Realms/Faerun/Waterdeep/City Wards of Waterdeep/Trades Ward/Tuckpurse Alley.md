# Tuckpurse Alley
## Overview
This alleyway runs east and south from the eastern end of [[Spendthrift Alley]], linking it to the easternmost end of Vellarrs Lane. By night, its very dark and a favorite working ground for thugs, some of whom use children to trip or snatch at passersby. Theres a very large rain barrel partway along this alley just behind Thond Glass & Glazing that you should beware of. Its gutter was diverted long ago, and it is used by thugs who crouch inside it, watching for prey through knotholes.
