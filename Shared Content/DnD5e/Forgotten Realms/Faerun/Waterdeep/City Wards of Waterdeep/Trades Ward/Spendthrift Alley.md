# Spendthrift Alley
## Overview
This former alley long ago grew into a major local street, but retained the feature that created its name: the ongoing bazaar of stalls and street vendors, selling everything cheap. This shoppers gift from the gods never closes. By night, this route is brilliantly lit, and the trading goes on. The place to go for small trifles, buttons, laces, and whatever you cant find elsewhere. It is apt to be crowded. Beware thieves.
