# Quaff Alley (Alley)
## Overview
Stretching west from [[Atkiss Alley]] to the rear of the Golden Horn gambling house, this short passage is named for its traditional use by drunkards, who drink here until they pass out, and snore the night away. In winter, the city watch spreads straw here for burrowing- bedding, to keep these unfortunates from freezing to death. Many a thief or adventurer has hidden among it temporarily.
