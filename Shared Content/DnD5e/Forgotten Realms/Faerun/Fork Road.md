# Fork Road
## Overview
The Fork Road is the only well-traveled trail between [[Sundabar]] and Citadel Adbar. At a point commonly known as "the Fork," the trail splits. One path heads north to Citadel Adbar (becoming the Adbar Road), while the other continues down a little-used path east toward [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Ascore]].
