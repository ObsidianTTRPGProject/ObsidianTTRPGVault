# Ten Trail
## Overview
A pass leads through the western mountains into the [[Spine of the World]], though the route is nigh impassable in winter because of the snow and ice. Well-armed caravans use the Ten Trail to move goods to and from the settlements of [[Icewind Dale]]. Although it's the safest route between lcewind Dale and the lands to the south, travelers are still at risk of attacks from crag cats, yetis, ores, brigands, and even the occasional white dragon.

The trail extends as far south as [[Fireshear]]. Characters traveling the Ten Trail in wintertime are subject to extreme cold temperatures (see the "Wilderness Survival" section in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
