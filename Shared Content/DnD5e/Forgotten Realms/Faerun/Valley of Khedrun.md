# Valley of Khedrun
## Overview
The frozen vale on the southern fringe of the [[Spine of the World]] is named for a legendary dwarf hero who used his axe to carve out the homeland of the dwarves in the North from lands dark with wolves, ores, and gob linoids. The Valley of Khedrun is haunted by the Great Worm tribe of Uthgardt barbarians.
