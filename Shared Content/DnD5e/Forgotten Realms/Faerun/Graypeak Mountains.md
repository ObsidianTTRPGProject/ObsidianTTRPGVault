# Graypeak Mountains
## Overview
An intermittent range of mountains running north and south separates [[Delimbiyr Vale]] from the [[Fallen Lands]] and the desert of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. The Graypeak Mountains are named for the tribes of gray-skinned stone giants who dwell here. The expanse is riddled with abandoned mines of both dwarven and Netherese origin.
