# Loudwater
## Overview
With [[Zelbross]], [[Orlbar]], and [[Llorkh]] in ruins, Loudwater is the last bastion of civilization in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] east of [[Secomber]]. If the [[G6 - Town|town]] is worried, it doesn't show rt. Loudwater provides a welcome respite for weary caravan and riverboat drivers, not to mention adventurers. It lies on both sides of the Delimbiyr River, the two halves linked by an arching stone overpass built by dwarves to honor the elves. Ancient wards placed on the overpass to preserve it had an unintended magical side effect: river trout attempting to swim under the bridge are propelled over it instead, which is why locals refer to it as the Flying Fish Bridge. People crossing the bridge are occasionally struck by these fish, which deal no damage. Whenever a fish hits a traveler and flops onto the bridge, it's a local custom (and considered good luck) to toss the fish back into the river.

Once a home to elves, Loudwater is a human [[G6 - Town|town]] today. Its grand wood-and-stone buildings are overgrown by vines and hung with flowering plants. Streets curl and meander. Huge, old trees line the riverbanks, and gardens and bowers are everywhere. The [[G6 - Town|town]] replaced its earthen rampart with a wall years ago, but the wall has flowers growing along its foundations both inside and outside the settlement. The river is unusually wide here, providing the [[G6 - Town|town]] with space for a modest harbor.

The High Lord's Hall is a mansion on the north side of the river. The [[G6 - Town|town]]'s current high lord is Telbor Zazrek (N male Damaran human mage), a retired adventurer and well-paid puppet of the Zhentarim who enjoys the power that has been handed to him. Through Zazrek, the Black Network maintains an invisible stranglehold on the [[G6 - Town|town]]. All goods that aren't supplied by the Zhentarim are heavily taxed, and the cost of living in Loudwater is so high that all of its establishments are forced to charge exorbitant prices.

Adding to Loudwater's problems are the stone giants of the [[Graypeak Mountains]] (see chapter 6, "Canyon of the Stone Giants"), who have begun laying waste to [[Llorkh]], [[Orlbar]], and the hamlets of [[Grayvale]]. Refugees are pouring into Loudwater, and those who can't afford to stay at the local inns are being herded like cows into warehouses overlooking the harbor. As if that weren't bad enough, stone giants have been seen spying on the [[G6 - Town|town]] from afar, no doubt trying to determine its defensive capabilities. Since the Black Network keeps its forces well hidden in Loudwater and the [[G6 - Town|town]] militia is a small force, Loudwater might seem like an easy target.
