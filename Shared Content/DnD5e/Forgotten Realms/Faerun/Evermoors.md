# Evermoors
## Overview
The Evermoors is a vast, unsettled area of fog-shrouded hi1ls, cold bogs, rocky ridges, and small peaks. Adventurers crossing this expanse might spot the occasional castle ruin or crumbled tower-a remnant of a bygone realm. Although the region attracts many prospectors, no kingdom or civilization in recent history has been able to tame it. Savage hill giants, ettin's, ogres, orcs, and trolls dwell here in great numbers. Settlements that stand on the edge of the Evermoors face constant threats from these and other monsters. Floating a mile above the Evermoors is Lyn Armaal, Countess Sansuri's cloud castle (see chapter 9, "Castle of the Cloud Giants"). The view of the castle from the ground is fleeting as it disappears behind overcast skies.
