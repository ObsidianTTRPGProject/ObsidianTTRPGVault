# Griffon's Nest

## Overview

A wooden palisade topped with the rotting heads of dead ores encircles a hilltop village of crude huts and longhouses in the northern part of the [[Surbrin Hills]]. Roughly three hundred Uthgardt barbarians of the Griffon tribe dwell here. Perched atop the rocky crest of Griffon's Nest is the longhouse of the [[Great Chief Halric Bonesnapper|great chief, Halric Bonesnapper]]. This building is where Halric meets with the other tribal chieftains to settle important matters and plan for the tribe's future. While Halric enjoys the comforts of a king, the rest of the tribe lives in squalor.

At various times in the past, visitors were welcome to meet and trade with the chieftains, but the Griffon tribe no longer opens its gates to strangers and in fact actively tries to slaughter them. Most of the residents of Griffon's Nest are **tribal warriors**, with a few dozen **berserkers**. An **Uthgardt shaman** (see appendix C) wanders the settlement, making sure no one speaks ill of the great chief. If the characters approach Griffon's Nest, the settlement opens its gates to them, inviting them to enter. This is a ploy. If the characters enter the settlement, the barbarians try to slaughter them and feast on their remains.

[[Great Chief Halric Bonesnapper]] is a berserker, with the following changes:

- Halric is chaotic evil and speaks Bothii (the Uthgardt language) and Common.

- He has 99 hit points and wields a +1 greataxe. He has a +6 bonus to hit with this weapon and deals 10 (`dice: 1d12 + 4`) slashing damage on a hit.
