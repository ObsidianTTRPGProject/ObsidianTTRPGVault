# Hundelstone
## Overview
At the highest elevations along [[Ten Trail]], only a few shrubs cling to life amid patches of moss-covered rock. Travelers on this route eventually come to Hundelstone, perching on the mountain slopes much like the surrounding flora. The [[G6 - Town|town]]'s buildings are low, with most of their rooms cut out of the hard soil and rock below ground level, and their roofs steeply pitched to better shed the snows that blanket the mountains in the winter. The shield dwarves and rock gnomes in Hundelstone get a chuckle out of warning visitors to stoop low as they walk about [[G6 - Town|town]], lest they be blown away by the wind.

For most people, Hundelstone is either the last outpost of civilization before taking the pass north to [[Icewind Dale]] or the first welcome sign of refuge after making the wearying trip back. Many of the dwarves and gnomes here spend their days excavating tunnels, mining ore, or smelting and smithing the local iron and tin. (Adventurers who venture down into these tunnels might be surprised to find that some of them descend for miles, in some cases all the way to [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]].) Hundelstone's few score human residents are mostly sellswords or would-be adventurers who earn a living as caravan guards or beast hunters in the [[Crags|crags]].

One notable resident of Hundelstone is an inventor named Thwip Ironbottom (CG male rock gnome **commoner**). A spy for the Harpers, Thwip keeps an eye on strangers passing through [[G6 - Town|town]] and uses a sending stone to stay in touch with [[Beldora (Homeless)|Beldora]], a Harper spy in [[Icewind Dale]] (see the "Beldora's Quest" section in chapter 2 for more information about Thwip).
