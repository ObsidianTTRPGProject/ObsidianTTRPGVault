# Elegy for the First World
![[000-00-001.dragon-splash.webp|right|300]]

>>Breathe, dragons; sing of the First World, forged out of chaos and painted with beauty. Sing of Bahamut, the Platinum, molding the shape of the mountains and rivers; Sing too of Chromatic Tiamat, painting all over the infinite canvas. Partnered, they woke in the darkness; partnered, they labored in acts of creation.
>>
>>Breathe, dragons; sing then of Sardior, ruby-red jewel they made in their likeness; Sardior, first-born of dragonkind, labored alongside Bahamut and Tiamat, Shaping the dragons they crafted: dragons metallic and dragons chromatic. Breathe, dragons—draw in the life-gift breathed into you at the dawn of creation.
>>
>>Breathe, dragons; sing of the outsiders, war-bringer gods with their mortal adherents; Teeming, they came to the First World, seeking a home for their legions of followers. Mighty in magic and numbers, conquering deities seized their victory. Fallen was noble Bahamut, Sardior hid in the heart of creation.
>>
>>Breathe, dragons; sing now of Tiamat, raging in battle with no hope of victory. She would not flee or surrender, fighting as death reached its cold claws toward her. War-bringers seized her and bound her, snatched her from death, entombed her in torment—Sealed in the darkness forever, captive to gods laying claim to creation.
>>
>>Breathe, dragons; sing of the conquest, seeding the world with their legions of followers, Each to their own habitation, elves in their forests and dwarves in their mountains, Orcs in their caverns and canyons, goblins in badlands and halflings in green fields, Lizardfolk lurking in marshes, humans throughout every part of creation.
>>
>>Breathe, dragons; sing of Bahamut, maker of peace with the outsider deities, Welcomed to mountains celestial, worshiped by some as the Platinum Paladin. Sing of his journeys of seeking, striving to understand gods and their children, Longing for Tiamat's freedom, grieving her loss from the face of creation.
>>
>>Breathe, dragons; sing of her freedom—Tiamat loosed from her prison of torment! Tell how she rallied her children, dragons chromatic, a spectrum of mayhem. Sing of her fury, her vengeance, lightning and venom, ice, fire, and corrosion, Five-headed, monstrous, and mighty, rampaging on a campaign of destruction.
>>
>>Breathe, dragons; sing of the First World, scattered in infinite seedling realities. Sing of Bahamut and Tiamat, watching its sundering, mourning their labor. Sing too of Sardior, sundered, consciousness scattered in minuscule fragments. Breathe, dragons: you are inheritors, ruling the wreck of the First World's destruction.

## A Treasury of Dragons
*This book insists on sorting dragons into little, understandable boxes as if the readers had only 100 years or so to live and their tiny baby-brains could hold only so much knowledge...*— FizbanIn the real world, dragons are a staple of folklore and fantasy literature, resonating as symbols of power and wisdom—and sometimes greed—across countless cultures. In the many worlds of D&D, dragons are ever-present monsters, relevant at every level of play as dangerous threats, wise patrons, or mysterious schemers.

*Fizban's Treasury of Dragons* is a comprehensive guide to the dragons of the worlds of D&D. It introduces the gem dragons—a family of five dragon kinds—as well as a variety of other Dragons and dragon-related monsters, character options, and inspirations.

This introduction sets the scene for what's to come in the rest of the book. It introduces the myth of the First World, created by Bahamut and Tiamat, then discusses the role that dragons play in the myths of many Material Plane worlds, as a reflection of that primordial story. It begins to explore the connections linking dragons on different worlds, which is elaborated throughout the rest of this book.

![[001-00-002.webp|right|300]]

*Chapter 1* introduces draconic-themed options for adventurers, including three variant dragonborn races, two dragon-oriented subclasses (the Drakewarden ranger and the Way of the Ascendant Dragon monk), feats, and roleplaying suggestions that can connect characters of any class to a draconic theme.

*Chapter 2* discusses magic related to dragons, including new spells, magic items, and draconic gifts (supernatural gifts explicitly connected to a dragon's power).

*Chapter 3* presents tips, advice, and tables to help Dungeon Masters build encounters, adventures, and whole campaigns around dragons.

*Chapter 4* discusses dragon lairs and hoards, examining what a lair means to a dragon and exploring the correlation between a dragon's magical might and the value of the dragon's hoard. It also provides an alternative method for randomly creating a dragon's hoard.

*Chapter 5* provides extensive resources related to each of twenty different draconic creatures. For each kind of dragon, this chapter provides inspiration to help DMs craft dragon personalities and dragon-themed adventures, including sample lair maps.

*Chapter 6* includes stat blocks and lore for a variety of new Dragons and dragon-oriented creatures. The family of gem dragons, aspects of the dragon gods, dragon minions, and more can be found here.

> ##### Dragons and Dragons
>*Fizban's Treasury of Dragons*, as the name states, is a book about dragons, but only secondarily a book about Dragons—that is, creatures with the Dragon type. Most of this book is concerned with the chromatic and metallic dragons described in the *Monster Manual*, as well as the gem dragons introduced in this book. These three families of dragons share a deeply magical nature tied to the mythic history of the Material Plane. A few other Dragons share many similar characteristics, and several of them are presented alongside the chromatic, metallic, and gem dragons in *chapter 5*. These include *dragon turtles* and *faerie dragons*, as well as the *deep dragon* and *moonstone dragon* introduced in *chapter 6*.
>
>It should be clear throughout this book whether we're discussing a specific kind of dragon, the members of the three great dragon families, or all creatures with the Dragon type. But if you see the word "dragon" (not capitalized) and you're not sure, assume we mean chromatic, gem, and metallic dragons.

## The First World
*Poets do have a way of editing and exaggerating. I remember that time as one big, boring, patience-trying dilly-dalliance. A lot of hurry up and wait.*— Fizban"Elegy for the First World" is an ancient Draconic poem of unknown origin, found with minor variations in the collections and traditions of dragons across many worlds of the Material Plane. Various creation myths told on different worlds echo some of the themes and notions of this poem, particularly when they describe dragons or draconic gods being involved in creating the world. But the heart of the poem is a profound assertion not found in any of those individual myths.

The elegy suggests that before the myriad worlds of the Material Plane came into being, before Oerth and Toril and Eberron and Krynn existed, the primordial dragons—Bahamut and Tiamat—worked together to create the Material Plane in the form of a single First World. All the worlds that now constitute the plane are, in the words of the poem, "seedling realities" formed when the First World was sundered in some unexplained catastrophe.

The story told in "Elegy for the First World" suggests a number of truths regarding the nature of dragons. First, it portrays the ten varieties of metallic and chromatic dragons as the first inhabitants of the Material Plane. Dragons were made to populate the First World before any other worlds came into being, but they were supplanted by the teeming peoples that the gods of the Outer Planes brought to inhabit that world. The elegy likewise suggests that dragons are living embodiments of the primordial energy of the First World, which now flows throughout the Material Plane, and that they are thus inextricably linked to the magic of that plane. The religions of numerous worlds teach that Humanoids are creatures of a dual nature—part material and part spiritual, made of the essence of both the Material Plane and the otherworldly Outer Planes. But dragons, at least in the view of "Elegy for the First World," are wholly material, dwelling in the Material Plane and embodying its essential nature.

Many worlds have myths and legends about Bahamut and Tiamat, though these primordial dragons are sometimes known by other names. But "Elegy for the First World" differs from nearly all those legends in its mention of Sardior, "first-born of dragonkind." The poem suggests that Bahamut and Tiamat created Sardior together, and that "ruby-red" Sardior then joined with Bahamut to craft the metallic dragons and with Tiamat to craft the chromatic dragons. Some dragons who have studied the poem believe that Sardior was destroyed and shattered along with the First World and that the Ruby Dragon's splintered consciousness became the gem dragons on the new worlds of the Material Plane.

### Dragons of Many Worlds
Whether it is regarded as interpretive myth or historical record, "Elegy for the First World" offers an explanation for the common elements that appear in the legends and mythology of so many worlds across the Material Plane. Dragons populated the First World from the time of its creation, and a variety of peoples came to live in the First World after their gods made war on the dragons. As such, the similar natures of the creatures now inhabiting the many different worlds of the Material Plane can be seen as a product of the First World's sundering. And because dragons are so tightly linked to the essence of the Material Plane, they are thought to be the only creatures that appear on every world formed from the shattering of the First World, even when they take on different forms.

#### Forgotten Realms
The most comprehensive histories suggest Toril (the world of the Forgotten Realms setting) has not always known dragons, at least not in their current forms. Many scholars theorize that Toril's dragons evolved from some reptilian ancestor. And though it's possible to read these theories as contradicting the story of "Elegy for the First World," it's also possible to imagine that the newly formed Toril, fragmented from the First World, retained a hazy memory of the full ideal of dragonkind, which then took thousands of years to manifest. Certainly, the dragons of Toril cleave closely to the draconic archetypes described in the *Monster Manual*, and although Bahamut and Tiamat have sometimes been known by other names on that world (such as Xymor and Tchazzar), they have always had a part to play in the world's divine drama.

#### Greyhawk
Myths concerning the creation of Oerth (home to the Greyhawk setting) are few and often contradictory. Still, a number of those myths mention the dragon gods—or a single draconic creator, Io, who shed his own blood to inspire creation. Dragons have been reclusive and rare for most of Oerth's recorded history, but ancient annals of the Suel Imperium record that that empire created the mighty *Orbs of Dragonkind* for use in a war against a powerful cabal of shadow-wielding red dragons.

#### Dragonlance
Legends say the world of Krynn (home to the Dragonlance setting) was created in the interplay between the High God and Chaos. Its most important cosmic powers have always been the three children of the High God—Paladine, Gilean, and Takhisis, with Paladine and Takhisis easily identifiable as Bahamut and Tiamat. According to the creation myths of Krynn, Paladine and Takhisis worked together to create five dragons to rule the world, but Takhisis secretly corrupted them, creating the first five chromatic dragons. Mourning the corruption of his children, Paladine worked with the forge-god Reorx to create the metallic dragons. Much of the history of Krynn involves the strife between Takhisis and Paladine and the ongoing effort to maintain balance between good and evil. Chromatic dragons have long been Takhisis's favored agents as she strives to dominate the world, while metallic dragons have helped the peoples of Krynn to foil her schemes. Meanwhile, Paladine, in the guise of a doddering old wizard named Fizban, walked among the peoples of Krynn to aid them—just as Bahamut has done on many worlds throughout their long histories.

#### Eberron
The myths of Eberron describe the involvement of the three Progenitor Dragons in that world's creation: Siberys, the Dragon Above; Khyber, the Dragon Below; and Eberron, the Dragon Between. These godlike beings are said to have created a microcosm of the multiverse in the depths of the Ethereal Plane, sequestered away from the Outer Planes and all the influence of the gods and other cosmic powers. Viewed through the lens of "Elegy for the First World," Eberron is thus not actually a fragment of the First World, but a second-generation derivative of that original realm—yet even Eberron is profoundly shaped by dragons.

### Dragonsight
A little-known phenomenon supports the central ideas expressed in "Elegy for the First World." Occasionally, dragons develop a sense known as dragonsight—an awareness of multiple incarnations of themselves across different worlds of the Material Plane. Dragonsight is most common in ancient dragons, especially when their enormous hoards include items from other worlds or powerful artifacts whose histories span multiple worlds. Gem dragons, perhaps because of their connection to Sardior, are most likely to develop dragonsight.

Dragons who develop dragonsight amass knowledge that spans the Material Plane, making them among the foremost experts on worlds beyond their own. With time, dragonsight can expand beyond passive awareness to allow active communication between a dragon's incarnations. Some ancient dragons with well-developed dragonsight begin to weave grand plans that involve coordinating activities across multiple worlds, culminating in cosmos-shaking events.

As one example, tales are told on multiple worlds of the Material Plane regarding the red dragon Ashardalon. Less widely understood, though, is the fact that as one Ashardalon developed his dragonsight, he concocted a scheme to preserve his existence by consuming his echoes on other worlds. All these different Ashardalons thus became a single, immensely powerful **greatwyrm** that fed on soul energy—and that prevented souls from incarnating into newly born creatures across the worlds.

Given most people's limited understanding of dragons' beliefs and philosophies, let alone dragonsight, many mortals are quick to describe dragons with heightened dragonsight as "dragon gods"—which they are not. Still, some powerful dragons have so successfully extended their consciousness across multiple incarnations, and so expertly coordinated their activities across multiple worlds, that they can seem godlike even to younger dragons. The **black greatwyrm** Chronepsis once accomplished a feat similar to Ashardalon's, with one version of the dragon devouring multiple echoes before leaving the Material Plane and establishing a lair in the Outer Planes.

> ##### Dragons and Dungeons
>Just as individual dragons have echoes across multiple worlds of the Material Plane, some places of tremendous power that have a connection to dragons resonate across the plane. Dungeons such as the Sunless Citadel (buried by Ashardalon in his wrath), Dragon Mountain (the lair of the red dragon Infyrana), and the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth (home to the black dragon Khisanth) manifest in various ways across multiple worlds. Similarly, the power of mighty dragonslayers often resonates around sites they build or inhabit. The Tomb of Horrors is one such site, crafted by the lich Acererak, whose uncountable evils included slaughtering metallic dragons for the magic of their blood.
>
>Artifacts associated with dragons can also resonate across the different worlds of the Material Plane. The clearest examples are the *Orbs of Dragonkind*, described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. On the world of Greyhawk, these artifacts were made during an era when the Suel Imperium battled a cabal of red dragons. On Krynn, the orbs (known there as *Dragon Orbs*) were created to defend the Towers of High Sorcery from dragon attack. In Faerûn, the *Orbs of Draconic Influence* were made by dragons to extend their influence over other dragons. The similarities among these artifacts are not a matter of coincidence or convergent magical evolution; these items partake of dragons' unique connection to the magical fabric of the Material Plane and echo across its many worlds.

# Character Creation
From the folk hero dreaming of liberating their people from a tyrannical blue dragon's reign to the idealistic acolyte who imagines purging the world of Tiamat's corruption, many adventurers aspire to be dragonslayers. In time, some have their dreams realized—or shattered in spectacular fashion, as they discover they are woefully unprepared for the threat a dragon poses.

This chapter is for any D&D character who hopes or fears that they might one day face a dragon. But this chapter is also for the bard who has made a lifelong study of dragonsong, the cleric devoted to Bahamut, and the warlock who made an eldritch pact with a moonstone dragon. For dragons are not always adversaries. They can be patrons, allies, and benefactors; they can scheme in the shadows; and they can dramatically shape adventurers' lives.

The following sections present a variety of options for creating characters with a tie to dragons:

*"Draconic Races"* presents variant dragonborn race options to give characters a draconic heritage strongly linked to the three great dragon families.

*"Subclass Options"* allows monk and ranger characters to explore deeper ties with dragonkind.

*"Heroes of the Dragon"* includes inspiration for characters of any class to portray their training or magic as derived from a connection to dragons.

*"Draconic Feats"* provides feats to forge connections to the chromatic, gem, and metallic dragon families.

![[002-01-001.chapter-splash.webp|right|300]](In his guise as a young monk, Bahamut helps a pair of adventurers put an end to a young red dragon's depredations)

## Draconic Races
*It's all too easy to prefer a certain color of dragonborn, but what's inside is what really matters—which is to say, the sort of damage their breath can do to you.*— FizbanThe *dragonborn* race in the *Player's Handbook* is the most direct way to reflect a character with dragons somewhere far back in their ancestry. But for players who want to try a more nuanced approach, this section offers three variant dragonborn race options that can be used to create a character with clear connections to a specific draconic ancestry. When you're making a new character using one of these races, use the rules under "Creating Your Character" to fill out the details.

### Creating Your Character
When you create your D&D character, you decide whether your character is a member of the human race or one of the game's fantastical races. If you select one of the dragonborn races in this chapter, follow these additional rules during character creation.

#### Ability Score Increases
When determining your character's ability scores, increase one of those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy.

The "Quick Build" section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You're free to follow those suggestions or to ignore them. Whichever scores you decide to increase, none of the scores can be raised above 20.

#### Languages
Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The *Player's Handbook* offers a list of widespread languages to choose from. The DM is free to add or remove languages from that list for a particular campaign.

#### Creature Type
Every creature in D&D, including every player character, has a special tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature they are. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. A race option presented here tells you what your character's creature type is.

Here's a list of the game's creature types in alphabetical order: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, Undead. These types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways. For example, the *cure wounds* spell doesn't work on a Construct or an Undead.

- Chromatic Dragonborn
- Gem Dragonborn
- Metallic Dragonborn

## Subclass Options
At 3rd level, a monk gains the Monastic Tradition class feature and a ranger gains the Ranger Archetype class feature. This section presents two new options for those features—the Drakewarden for the ranger and the Way of the Ascendant Dragon for the monk.

- Monk: Way of the Ascendant Dragon
- Ranger: Drakewarden

![[drakewarden ranger.webp|right|300]](A dragonborn drakewarden shares affection with her drake companion)
## Heroes of the Dragon
Sorcerers whose magic comes from a draconic origin, rangers with a drake companion, and monks who learn the ways of dragon masters are not the only adventurers whose skills, spells, and class features can have their source in the power of dragons. A character of any class can have strong ties to dragonkind. The Draconic Character Ties table provides ideas you might draw on as inspiration for infusing your character with draconic flavor. The classes noted in parentheses at the end of each entry are particularly appropriate for a given tie, but you are not limited to those options.

##### Draconic Character Ties
| d10 | Draconic Tie |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | I revere and draw my power from one of the dragon gods—most likely Bahamut or Tiamat, but possibly Sardior or a powerful dragon with heightened dragonsight, such as Aasterinian, Ashardalon, or Chronepsis. (Cleric, paladin, warlock) |
| 2 | I revere or host a draconic spirit, akin to a nature or ancestral spirit. (Barbarian, druid, ranger) |
| 3 | I was part of an order that preserves the teachings of an ancient dragon founder. (Fighter, monk, paladin, wizard) |
| 4 | I have a dragon for a mentor or patron. (Bard, druid, fighter, rogue, sorcerer, warlock) |
| 5 | I use my class features to take on draconic characteristics. (Barbarian, sorcerer) |
| 6 | I have a dragon tooth, horn, claw, or scale that I use as a focus for my spellcasting. (Cleric, druid, paladin, ranger, sorcerer, warlock, wizard) |
| 7 | A dragon ancestor, or a dragon's gift to my ancestor, fuels my might. (Barbarian, fighter, sorcerer) |
| 8 | My connection to nature gives me a strange link to a dragon whose presence alters the fabric of nature around the dragon's lair. (Druid, ranger) |
| 9 | I recently discovered that a person I loved and trusted was a dragon in disguise. (Any) |
| 10 | I have an apparently mundane item that was stolen from a dragon's hoard, and inexplicable things happen when I carry it with me. (Any) |

## Draconic Feats
A feat represents a character achieving mastery in one of their capabilities or discovering the ability to do something new. When this mastery arises from a draconic source—whether it's the gift of a dragon, the manifestation of some form of draconic heritage, the blessing of a draconic god, or a consequence of slaying a dragon—it can have supernatural effects.

Here are feats that bestow draconic power, available to you if you use the *optional feat rule* in the *Player's Handbook*.

- Gift of the Chromatic Dragon
- Gift of the Gem Dragon
- Gift of the Metallic Dragon
---
# Dragon Magic
The magic woven through the fabric of the Material Plane is concentrated in dragons and their lairs. This chapter is all about the magic of dragons, unfolding in four sections:

*"Spells"* offers a selection of spells associated with dragons.

*"Magic Items"* presents several magic items associated with dragons, many connected to the gem dragons introduced in *chapter 6*.

*"Hoard Items"* introduces a new kind of magic items, which siphon the magical energy associated with a dragon's hoard.

*"Draconic Gifts"* introduces magical gifts that characters might gain in connection with a dragon's death or other unusual circumstances.

![[008-02-001.chapter-splash.webp|right|300]](In any form, Bahamut delights in the "Aha!" moments of teaching young students)

## Spells
*I am less guarded with my spells than I am with my recipes. Magic shared is soon improved. But when it comes to my pudding, well, you can't fix perfect.*— FizbanThis section contains new spells that the DM may add to a campaign, making them available to player characters and monster spellcasters alike. The Spells table lists the new spells, ordering them by level. The table also notes the school of magic of a spell, whether it requires concentration, whether it bears the ritual tag, and which classes have access to it.

##### Spells
| Level | Spell | School | Conc. | Ritual | Class |
|:---:|---|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| 2nd | *Nathair's Mischief* | Illusion | Yes | No | Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard |
| 2nd | *Rime's Binding Ice* | Evocation | No | No | Sorcerer, Wizard |
| 3rd | *Ashardalon's Stride* | Transmutation | Yes | No | Artificer,* Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard |
| 4th | *Raulothim's Psychic Lance* | Enchantment | No | No | Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard |
| 5th | *Summon Draconic Spirit* | Conjuration | Yes | No | Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard |
| 6th | *Fizban's Platinum Shield* | Abjuration | Yes | No | Sorcerer, Wizard |
| 7th | *Draconic Transformation* | Transmutation | Yes | No | Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard |
*The artificer class appears in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* and *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*.

## Magic Items
*If you happen to find yourself in possession of a platinum scarf, be prepared for side effects: head swivels, gasps of admiration, and myriad compliments.*— FizbanThe following magic items are presented in alphabetical order.

- *Amethyst Lodestone*
- *Crystal Blade*
- Dragonhide Belt (*+1*, *+2*, *+3*)
- *Dragonlance*
- *Dragon Wing Bow*
- *Emerald Pen*
- *Flail of Tiamat*
- *Gold Canary Figurine of Wondrous Power*
- *Platinum Scarf*
- *Potion of Dragon's Majesty*
- *Ruby Weave Gem*
- *Sapphire Buckler*
- *Topaz Annihilator*

## Hoard Magic Items
*I've let adventurers put their toys in my hoard to steep once or twice. I can never get a good night's sleep while they're there, though. It's like an itch.*— FizbanCertain magic items can absorb the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard. The mightier the dragon, the more powerful the item becomes when it is steeped in the dragon's hoard. These items, called hoard items, have four states, which are summarized on the Hoard Item States table. A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant state.

##### Hoard Item States
| State | Age |
|:---:|:---:|
| Slumbering | — |
| Stirring | Young |
| Wakened | Adult |
| Ascendant | Ancient |

### Increasing Power
A hoard item left to steep in a dragon's hoard absorbs power from the hoard. Older dragons' hoards are charged with more magic and can empower hoard items to higher states.

Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon, as shown on the Hoard Item States table. For example, a hoard item that steeps in a young dragon's hoard for 1 year enters its Stirring state, while one that steeps in an ancient dragon's hoard for 1 year reaches the pinnacle of its power and enters its Ascendant state. If there are one or more hoard items steeping in a dragon's hoard, the dragon is aware of them. The dragon also knows what these hoard items are and what state (Slumbering, Stirring, Wakened, or Ascendant) each of them is in.

When a dragon is slain, the magic surrounding its hoard becomes volatile. This allows a hoard item to steep more quickly in the hoard. A hoard item steeped in a dragon's hoard for 8 hours rises one state (from Slumbering to Stirring, Stirring to Wakened, or Wakened to Ascendant), as long as the steeping begins within 1 hour of the dragon's death and occurs within the dragon's lair. Steeping in this way can't raise the state of the item beyond the state associated with the dragon's age—putting a Wakened item in a slain adult dragon's hoard does not make it Ascendant, for example.

### Decreasing Power
Just as hoard items can grow in power by absorbing the ambient magic of a dragon's hoard, so too can these treasures fall back into slumber. If no creature is attuned to a hoard item and that item isn't in a dragon's hoard, the item decreases in power by one state every 30 days until it is Slumbering.

### Hoard Item Quirks
Hoard items often manifest strange qualities beyond their intended function, regardless of the state they're in. Roll once on the Draconic Quirks table to determine the quirk of a hoard item.

##### Draconic Quirks
| d8 | Quirk |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | When resting on the ground, the item points in the direction of the last hoard it steeped in. |
| 2 | The item's bearer can speak and understand Draconic. |
| 3 | The item glows softly when within 60 feet of a Dragon or another hoard item. |
| 4 | The item's bearer gains a swimming speed equal to their walking speed. |
| 5 | The item's bearer has advantage on Intelligence (History) checks. |
| 6 | The item's bearer has advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against non-Dragons. |
| 7 | The item grants its bearer resistance to the damage type of the breath weapon of the last dragon whose hoard the item steeped in. |
| 8 | The item's bearer dreams of the dragon whose hoard the item last steeped in. |

### Hoard Item Descriptions
![[011-02-004.a-magic-weapon.webp|right|300]](A magic weapon recovered from a dragon's hoard carries some of the dragon's magic)

Hoard items are presented here in alphabetical order. A hoard item's rarity changes depending on its current state, as shown in each item description.

- *Dragon's Wrath Weapon*
- *Dragon-Touched Focus*
- *Dragon Vessel*
- *Scaled Ornament*

## Draconic Gifts
*You know the proverb: don't look a draconic gift in the mouth. Some say it's because of the breath weapon. But really it's the smell.*— FizbanAs described in *chapter 3*, the death of a dragon can result in its power taking root in a character, whether that person is the dragon's chosen heir or the dragon's killer. The result of this investiture can vary widely in power and impact, from a minor charm to a complete transformation.

Sometimes, a draconic gift has an obvious visual manifestation, such as when a character is transformed into a dragonborn. Other gifts are invisible, but no less potent. But on some worlds, the investiture of draconic power is accompanied by some kind of physical manifestation, especially if it's derived from slaying a dragon. It might be small and easily hidden, but those who know to look can usually identify a dragonslayer (or another character who carries a draconic gift) by a telltale sign. The Draconic Marks table suggests some possibilities of what these marks might look like.

##### Draconic Marks
| d4 | Visual Manifestation |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | One or both of the character's eyes change color to resemble the dragon's eyes or scales. |
| 2 | The character's hair (or a streak of it) changes color to match the color of the dragon's scales. |
| 3 | A mark like a stylized dragon eye or claw appears on the body. |
| 4 | Patches of scales appear on the character's body, typically on the neck, shoulders, or forearms. |

### Draconic Gift Descriptions
*Some of the less common draconic gifts I've seen bestowed include chubby cheeks and an adorable nature; the ability to blow immaculate smoke rings; and the innate sense of when your egg is perfectly soft-boiled. I wouldn't mind that last one myself.*— FizbanThe draconic gifts detailed in this section have rarities like magic items. The rarity of a draconic gift corresponds roughly to the age category of the dragon that bestowed it, as shown in the Draconic Gift Rarity table.

You can use a more common draconic gift for an older dragon, but exercise caution going in the other direction. Very rare and legendary draconic gifts can unbalance the game if they're given to low-level characters.

##### Draconic Gift Rarity
| Rarity | Age Category |
|:---:|:---:|
| Uncommon | Wyrmling |
| Rare | Young |
| Very rare | Adult |
| Legendary | Ancient |

- Draconic Familiar
- Draconic Rebirth
- Draconic Senses
- Echo of Dragonsight
- Frightful Presence
- Psionic Reach
- Scaled Toughness
- Tongue of the Dragon

![[012-02-005.a-dragons-blood.webp|right|300]](A dragon's blood can be as powerful as it is toxic)

> ##### Feats as Draconic Gifts
>If your campaign uses the optional feat rules from the *Player's Handbook*, your Dungeon Master might give you a feat as a variant draconic gift. You gain one feat of your or the DM's choice, which is related in some way to the draconic power you have acquired. Consider these examples:
>
>- Your heightened senses give you a dragon's awareness of your surroundings (Alert or Observant).
>- Dragon's blood has made you hardy and resilient (Durable, Resilient, or Tough).
>- Exposure to the primal energy of a dragon's body has given you a magical affinity for one damage type (Elemental Adept).
>- You are infused with a dragon's charismatic gift for inspiration (Inspiring Leader).
>- You are imbued with a dragon's intellect (Keen Mind).

# Dragons in Play
This chapter is intended for the Dungeon Master. The ideas and tables herein can help inspire you as you prepare to use dragons in your D&D game, whether you're building a single climactic encounter or planning a whole campaign around these marvelous creatures. The material here builds on what's in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* and the "Dragons" section of the *Monster Manual*. It's divided into five main sections:

*"Roleplaying Dragons"* presents tips and tricks for building a dragon character as complex and distinctive as any other villain, ally, or mysterious figure in your campaign. It includes tables to help you craft dragon personalities, as well as discussions of dragon aging, reproduction, and death; dragons' relationship to undeath and religion; and draconic shape-shifting and organizations.

*"Followers"* explores the relationships between dragons and the various creatures that might serve their interests.

*"Dragon Encounters"* offers suggestions for building encounters that feature dragons, whether you want such an encounter to be the climax of an adventure or an obstacle in a larger narrative.

*"Dragon Adventures"* looks at the different roles a dragon can play in an adventure's story.

*"Dragon Campaigns"* talks about building worlds and campaign story arcs that put dragons at the forefront of history and at the center of the characters' lives and adventuring ambitions.

## Roleplaying Dragons
*To portray a convincing human, one must embody greed, selfishness, and vigilance. To portray a convincing dragon, one must relax.*— FizbanDragons are complex creatures with varied personalities, goals, priorities, and mannerisms. In that respect, they're much like mortal folk—but dragons are also shaped by their specifically draconic characteristics, including incredibly long life spans, fundamentally magical biology, and the sheer enormity of their power.

### Dragon Characters
The *Dungeon Master's Guide* includes a series of *tables and guidelines* designed to help you craft NPCs. This section presents alternatives to those tables, helping you transform a dragon from a stat block and a basic description into a full-fledged character in your campaign.

In *chapter 5* of this book, you'll find additional tables of personality traits and ideals that are customized to various kinds of dragons.

##### Dragon Appearance

| 19 | Sighs restlessly, giving an impression of tremendous boredom |
| 20 | Deeply suspicious, treating all Humanoids encountered as probable agents of a rival dragon |

##### Dragon Bonds
| d10 | Bond |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | I treasure one particular item in my hoard—a gift from a person I loved, who is long since dead. |

![[015-03-003.webp|right|300]]

##### Dragon Flaws and Secrets
| d10 | Flaw or Secret |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | I find adventurers fearsome, and I'm convinced that I'll meet my doom at their hands one day. |
| 2 | One item in my possession is worth as much as the rest of my hoard combined, and the fear that it might be stolen consumes me. |
| 3 | Given the opportunity, I eat to excess and then fall into a long, deep sleep. |
| 4 | I would rather let my fearsome reputation scare away intruders than fight them off. |
| 5 | Other dragons would scorn me if they knew how fondly I regard my minions. They're so cute! |
| 6 | I am terrified of creatures from the Outer Planes—especially modrons. |
| 7 | Another dragon has sworn to find and destroy me. |
| 8 | Humanoids are not ready to learn the horrible cosmic truths in the books in my hoard. |
| 9 | The prospect of living for centuries more exhausts me. |
| 10 | I'm convinced that a version of me on a different world in the Material Plane is hoping to destroy me and steal my hoard. |

#### How to Name Your Dragon
*Many Common phrases have origins in Draconic names. "Great googly-moogly," "goody goody gumdrops," and "gadzooks" all have their origins in the name of my capricious friend Galgalothmogalthas, whose dragon breath also produced a boppy, trumpet-y tune.*— FizbanSome dragons' names resonate with power and inspire terror: Ashardalon, Dragotha, Klauth, Khellendros, Malystryx, Vaskar. Others are intricate and obscure, reflecting the grandeur of dragons' ancient language: Ingeloakastimizilian, Imvaernarhro, K'rshinthintl, Claugiyliamatar.

![[016-03-004.commonly-known-as.webp|right|300]](Commonly known as "Old Gnawbone," Claugiyliamatar is often seen with a mangled corpse hanging from her mouth)

Many dragons are better known by nicknames and epithets. Klauth is commonly called Old Snarl, and Khellendros is remembered as Skie and the Storm over Krynn. Ingeloakastimizilian is Icingdeath, Imvaernarhro is Inferno, and K'rshinthintl and Claugiyliamatar are called Cyan Bloodbane and Old Gnawbones, respectively.

When naming a dragon, take whatever approach appeals to you. But bear in mind that dragons need memorable names, and if you or your players have trouble pronouncing a name, it's likely to be quickly forgotten—or jokingly abbreviated.

The Dragon Name Elements table provides Draconic morphemes that appear in dragon names. You can combine these elements to form a dragon name. For each element, roll a d20, then choose one of the four possible results from the table, or roll a d4 to determine which column to choose from. If you like, you can rearrange these elements and add or drop letters to create a smoother flow or a more dramatic sound. For nicknames, look for inspiration in the dragon's abilities, mannerisms, or most famous acts.

#### Customizing Dragons
As discussed in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, you can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character. Minor changes such as those below are easy to make and have no impact on a dragon's challenge rating.

***Languages.*** Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.

***Skills.*** Most dragons are proficient in the Perception and Stealth skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.

***Spells.*** The *Monster Manual*'s variant rule about making dragons innate spellcasters is an easy way to add variety to dragons without impacting their challenge rating. *Chapter 5* offers suggested spell lists for different kinds of dragons, but you can also choose spells to reflect the dragon's character. A dragon who innately casts druid spells feels different from one who casts warlock spells. You can also give a dragon spells of a higher level than the variant rule allows, but such a tweak might increase the dragon's challenge rating—especially if those spells deal damage or impose conditions on targets.

***Other Traits and Actions.*** You can borrow traits and actions from other monsters to add unique flavor to a dragon. Consider these examples:

- **Change Shape** You can decide that a dragon acquires this action at a younger age than usual, particularly if you want to feature a dragon in Humanoid form in your campaign. The "*Shape-Shifting*" section later in this chapter offers more information and inspiration. (See the metallic dragons in the *Monster Manual*.)
- **Damage Absorption** You might decide that a red or gold dragon is not only unharmed by fire damage, but actually healed by it. (See the **flesh golem** in the *Monster Manual*.)
- **Flyby** The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach. (See the **peryton** in the *Monster Manual*.)
- **Mimicry** Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon. (See the **kenku** in the *Monster Manual*.)
- **Rejuvenation** You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery. (See the **lich** in the *Monster Manual*.)
- **Special Senses** Most dragons have blindsight and darkvision. You might upgrade blindsight to truesight, or you could give a dragon with a burrowing speed tremorsense. (See the *introduction* to the *Monster Manual*.)
- **Tunneler** Any dragon with a burrowing speed could have this trait, moving through solid rock and leaving a tunnel in its wake. (See the **umber hulk** in the *Monster Manual*.)

### Life Span
*Try not to be offended when a dragon dismisses you as irrelevant. Remember, you might be dealing with an individual who hatched into the world three civilizations ago, and not every dragon has the wisdom to see how lone heroes can change the course of history.*— FizbanSome dragons can live for over a thousand years, outlasting the rise and fall of nations—or even whole civilizations. A dragon's perspective on the passage of time is naturally quite different from that of more short-lived folk. But just as characters expand their priorities and perspectives as they advance in level, so do dragons as they age.

The tables in this section suggest possible goals that reflect the priorities of dragons at different ages. Of course, a dragon's goals are shaped by many additional factors, including alignment, ideals, bonds, and flaws. So use these tables as a starting point, but flesh out each dragon's goals as you develop a complete picture of the dragon's personality.

![[017-03-005.blue-wyrmling.webp|right|300]](Blue Wyrmling)

#### Wyrmlings
Much like adventurers in the first tier of play (levels 1 to 4), dragons in their first five years of life are still figuring out their capabilities and their place in the world. Thus, wyrmlings often rely on adult dragons or other companion creatures for safety.

Wyrmlings most often think on a local scale—an area no larger than might be covered by a few farmsteads or villages. If adult dragons are rearing a clutch of wyrmlings, the younger dragons often divide the adults' territory among them. A single wyrmling might thus hunt an area covering only a few square miles, but the presence of one wyrmling indicates that more might be nearby. On the other hand, wyrmlings without adult dragons in their lives might become allies or as captives of other kinds of creatures. Such wyrmlings are more likely to be scattered from their nest mates.

##### Wyrmling Goals
| d6 | Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Establish independence from adult dragons (or other powerful creatures) |
| 2 | Acquire one valuable magic item or art object to build a hoard around |
| 3 | Acquire minions who will bring food and treasure |
| 4 | Establish dominance over other wyrmlings in the same brood |
| 5 | Secure a partnership with a more powerful creature for safety |
| 6 | Find a good spot for a first independent lair |

#### Young Dragons
Young dragons in their first century of life are similar in many ways to adventurers in the second tier of play (levels 5 to 10), as they're beginning to come into their own among the most powerful creatures of the Material Plane.

![[018-03-006.young-blue-dragon.webp|right|300]](Young blue dragon)

This stage is when most dragons first establish their own territory and lair. A young dragon's territory covers an area about 50 miles across. This is also when dragons start to form the magical ties that bind them to both their hoards and the regions around their lairs.

Hunting dragons typically fly on a more-or-less circular path out to one edge of their territory and back in a day, traveling about 75 miles in total. Young dragons also use their hunting flights to keep tabs on happenings within their territory and are keenly aware of other creatures whose territory neighbors or overlaps their own. A young dragon can become a significant threat to a city or kingdom, either through overt violence or subtle manipulation.

##### Young Dragon Goals
| d6 | Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Establish a lair and develop the land around it to maximize safety and good hunting |
| 2 | Amass as much treasure as possible |
| 3 | Acquire magical wards to help protect the lair |
| 4 | Sabotage the efforts of other young dragons to establish lairs in the local area |
| 5 | Earn the fear and respect of other creatures living near the lair through displays of power |
| 6 | Secure the allegiance of loyal and powerful minions |

#### Adult Dragons
After their first century of life, adult dragons are mighty beings, akin to characters in the third tier of play (levels 11 to 16). An adult dragon's influence can extend across a whole region or continent.

Most adult dragons establish additional lairs to expand their territory. These lairs are usually set 50 to 75 miles apart, so the dragon can fly from one to the next in a single day's travel. An adult dragon typically hunts the area around one lair for a month or more, then moves on to another lair. The dragon's magical connection to a lair can transform the surrounding region, as represented by regional effects.

![[019-03-007.adult-blue-dragon.webp|right|300]](Adult blue dragon)

##### Adult Dragon Goals
| d6 | Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Find a good location for an additional lair |
| 2 | Acquire an artifact or a powerful magic item for the hoard |
| 3 | Establish a dynastic bloodline by producing young |
| 4 | Eliminate younger dragons who could become rivals or threats if they are allowed to grow older |
| 5 | Transform a large region into an environment suitable for the dragon's preferred sort of lair |
| 6 | Develop dragonsight to pursue goals across multiple worlds |

> ##### Dragons and Territory
>As dragons age, their sense of territory expands, and many establish multiple lairs across the region they call home. The larger a dragon's territory is, the more likely it is to edge up against or overlap the territory of another dragon. The territory of an adult or ancient dragon often encompasses the territories of younger dragons, as long as the older dragon doesn't feel threatened by the younger ones.
>
>Considering the regions of a campaign world, an area about 50 miles across, such as a barony or a small forest, might include the territory of a single dragon who's young or older.
>
>An area about 300 miles across—a kingdom or a large geographical region—can contain the territories of two to three dozen dragons, as long as most of them are young. Only three or four adult or ancient dragons are likely to occupy such a region. A single adult dragon might range over a region that includes the territories of up to six or eight young dragons (which might include the adult's offspring), but adults typically share territory with other adults only as mates or as members of a special alliance or organization.
>
>A whole continent, about 3,000 miles across, might include the territories of hundreds of young dragons and dozens of adults, but rarely more than a handful of ancient dragons.
>

![[020-03-008.ancient-blue-dragon.webp|right|300]](Ancient blue dragon)

#### Ancient Dragons
Dragons are considered ancient once they reach eight hundred years of life, and many live for centuries more. Ancient dragons are among the mightiest creatures in the multiverse, and like characters in the fourth tier of play (levels 17 to 20), they are powerful enough to alter the fate of the world and upset the balance of power across the planes of existence.

An ancient dragon typically has several lairs, each one suffused with powerful magic. The regional effects surrounding each of an ancient dragon's lairs can combine to make that dragon's influence felt in the natural world for hundreds of miles. In addition to these magical effects, the dragon's ongoing presence can have a profound impact on the region's ecosystems, populations, and politics.

***Greatwyrms.*** The oldest ancient dragons sometimes transform into mythic creatures of godlike power. These greatwyrms, described in *chapter 6*, are nearly perfect avatars of draconic nature and are so suffused with the magic of the Material Plane that they are all but immortal. Many result from ancient dragons ritually combining multiple echoes of themselves into a single corporeal form, as Ashardalon and Chronepsis are said to have done. Most greatwyrms are at least twelve centuries old and have hoards worth millions of gold pieces, but they are otherwise similar to other ancient dragons in their goals and perspectives.

##### Ancient Dragon Goals
| d6 | Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Avoid decline by becoming Undead or seeking magical alternatives to aging |
| 2 | Transcend the limits of physical existence on a single world by uniting echoes across multiple worlds or establishing a lair on another plane of existence |
| 3 | Acquire a particular artifact, perhaps to complete a set (all three parts of the Regalia of Evil, the *Eye of Vecna* and *Hand of Vecna*, and so forth) |
| 4 | Collect a complete set of artistic treasures, such as all the paintings of a great master, manuscripts for a famed author's entire body of writings, or every piece of jewelry made by a master artisan |
| 5 | Transform an entire world into an extreme environment suitable as a lair—a volcanic hellscape, a frozen wonderland, an arid wasteland, or the like |
| 6 | Destroy one or more gods as an act of vengeance or to ascend to godhood |

### Reproduction
*Dragons are like lizards. They existed before humanoids and will exist long after them, they can manipulate reality's fabric, and they transcend natural laws! Wait... not like lizards. Ah! Like magic.*— FizbanDragon reproduction varies from world to world in the Material Plane and can vary further depending on the family, kind, or individual nature of the dragons involved. Humanoids observing dragons have long assumed that their reproductive cycle resembles that of mundane reptiles—that two dragons of different sexes mate and produce a clutch of eggs. Sometimes, on some worlds, this is true, but dragon reproduction covers a wide range of other possibilities. You can use the Origin of Dragon Eggs table to choose a method of reproduction that holds true for all dragons on your world, to determine the origin of a specific clutch of eggs, or for anything in between.

##### Origin of Dragon Eggs
| d10 | Origin |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Spontaneous Reincarnation**. When an adult or older dragon dies, one or more eggs form in the dragon's decomposing body. These eggs might grow like fungus as the body rots away, they could appear among the ashes after the body is consumed by fire, or they might need to be mined out from a corpse that has turned to solid stone or metal. |
| 2 | **Seedlings of the First World**. At the heart of the world (underground, or in a remote area of pristine wilderness) stands a tree on which dragon eggs grow like fruit. Once in a lifetime, each dragon feels an overwhelming urge to seek out this tree. After finding it, the dragon must persuade its guardian to relinquish one or more eggs. |
| 3 | **Consuming Treasure**. By eating a significant portion of their own hoards, dragons cause themselves to lay clutches of eggs. |
| 4 | **Magical Crafting**. Mirroring the creative acts of Bahamut and Tiamat, dragons craft their eggs through painstaking labor, then breathe the gift of life into them. |
| 5 | **Draconic Transformation**. Enlightened non-dragons (most often Humanoids) are transformed into dragon eggs when they die, when they experience profound enlightenment, or when they undergo a ritual that might involve bathing in dragon blood or being devoured by a dragon. Humanoids and dragons alike understand the transformation to be a transition into a higher state of existence. |
| 6 | **Divine Origin**. Only Bahamut and Tiamat can create dragon eggs—each egg is the result of divine intervention. |
| 7 | **Spontaneous Formation**. Dragon eggs arise naturally in certain regions, often in underground veins of metal ore or gems for metallic and gem dragons, respectively, or in extreme environments (volcanoes, arctic wastes, deadly swamps, and so forth) for chromatic dragons. The eggs might hatch on their own, or they might have to be unearthed first by another creature, whether that's an adult or older dragon or a hapless miner. |
| 8 | **Parthenogenesis**. An adult or older dragon can lay a clutch of eggs whenever the dragon feels ready to rear a clutch of wyrmlings—or to impose that responsibility on others. |
| 9 | **Dragon Conclave**. Five adult or older dragons of different kinds come together to create a clutch of eggs, with each giving up a bit of life energy as part of the process. This clutch of eggs hatches five dragons of different kinds, depending on the dragons making up the conclave. |
| 10 | **Rejuvenation**. An ancient dragon voluntarily enters a deep trance and eventually dies, leaving behind a single egg. |

Once an egg comes into being, it must mature before it is ready to hatch into a wyrmling. Typically, an egg thrives only in an environment appropriate for a dragon of its kind—nestled in a pool of lava for a red or gold dragon, in ice for a white or silver dragon, in rotting vegetation for a black or green dragon, in sun-heated sand for a brass or blue dragon, or in a storm-wracked sea cave or inhospitable moorland for a bronze or copper dragon. Gem dragon eggs generally incubate encased in rock or in small caves. The incubation period for any egg might range from 6 months to several decades or longer.

![[021-03-009.miners-discover.webp|right|300]](Miners discover an amethyst dragon egg)

#### Half-Dragons
Just as dragon reproduction is not necessarily a straightforward biological process, half-dragons come into being through a variety of means. The Half-Dragon Origin table below offers examples.

Dragons create half-dragon progeny for a wide range of reasons. Some dragons create half-dragons to secure reliable minions. Others seed half-dragons around their lairs to make the area more dangerous to interlopers. And on many occasions, half-dragons simply appear spontaneously or are an accidental consequence of a dragon's magical power and influence.

In some worlds, these same phenomena might explain the origins of dragonborn, kobolds, and perhaps the draconic gifts described in *chapter 2*.

##### Half-Dragon Origin
| d6 | Origin |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Regional Effects**. The magical influence of a dragon's lair causes half-dragons to spontaneously arise among the area's other creatures. |
| 2 | **Forbidden Fruit**. A dragon can cause a particular tree to produce magical fruit. When eaten by a creature able to bear children, the fruit causes the creature to bear a half-dragon. |
| 3 | **True Love's Gift**. Love occasionally blossoms between dragons and creatures of other kinds, and this life bond can result in half-dragon children. Most half-dragons born of love are created as a magical gift. |
| 4 | **Blood Transformation**. A creature that bathes in or drinks the blood of a dragon can sometimes be transformed into a half-dragon. A dragon might voluntarily offer some blood to bring this about, or it could happen accidentally when a would-be dragonslayer is splashed with dragon blood. |
| 5 | **Cradle Favor**. A dragon might bestow the gift of draconic power on a newborn baby or an unborn child—as either a blessing or a curse. |
| 6 | **Hoard Thieves**. The hoard of an older dragon is imbued with that dragon's power. Those who steal from such a hoard might transform into half-dragons as that power leaches into them. |

### Death of a Dragon
*When I go, I dream of passing my spirit into that with which I have had the most profound experiences. The first thing that comes to mind is a caramel treacle from the Foxy Duck Tavern. Yum!*— FizbanDragons are intimately bound up with the fabric of magic that undergirds the Material Plane. As a result, the death of any dragon is an event of tremendous significance—and those who bring about a dragon's death are often changed forever.

Some sages describe dragons as being akin to knots in the fabric of magic—concentrations of power in material form. When a dragon dies, that knot is undone, sometimes resulting in a surge of magical energy. You can use the Dragon Death Throes table to help you decide what happens when a dragon dies. Characters who slay a dragon are often on their last legs when the dragon finally succumbs, so if an effect is likely to kill a character, roll again or choose a less dangerous result.

##### Dragon Death Throes
| d6 | Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The dragon immediately uses one of its lair actions, centering the effect on itself. For example, a fallen black dragon and any characters around it might be pulled into a nearby pool of water, and a copper dragon's body might be swallowed suddenly in mud. |
| 2 | The dragon uses its breath weapon one last time. |
| 3 | The dragon's body transforms into stone, metal, lava, ice, or mist. Or the body dissipates, leaving behind only a transformed heart or other organ. |
| 4 | Roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the "Sorcerer" section of the *Player's Handbook*, rerolling any inappropriate result. |
| 5 | A surge of life energy erupts from the dragon, causing each creature within 120 feet of the body to gain the benefit of finishing a long rest. |
| 6 | The body is drawn through a portal to the lair of one of the dragon's echoes on another world, increasing that echo's power. |

#### Regional Reversal
As described in the *Monster Manual* and discussed in more detail in *chapter 4*, a dragon's presence alters the region around the dragon's lair. When the dragon dies, those effects typically end immediately or fade away over the course of several days. But a traumatic death sometimes extends negative effects throughout the region. These can include instantaneous effects as well as lingering magic that persists for 1d10 days, as in the following examples:

- **Fouled Water** Water within 6 miles of the lair changes color and is fouled for 1d10 days.
- **Restless Sleep** Any creature that sleeps within 6 miles of the lair is troubled by nightmares for the next 1d10 days.
- **Trembling Earth** An enormous tremor shakes the earth within 6 miles of the lair.
- **Wildlife Changes** Creatures previously attracted by the dragon's presence undergo sharp behavioral changes, perhaps attacking any creatures they see or beginning a mass migration away from the lair.
- **Winds of Change** The weather within 6 miles of the lair changes dramatically.
- **Withering Burst** Ordinary vegetation within 1 mile of the dragon's lair blackens and shrivels.

#### Passing the Mantle
When a dragon dies, the power enfleshed in the dragon doesn't just disappear from the world. Over time, it disperses, but in the moments immediately surrounding the dragon's death, it can be passed on to others—or claimed. Sometimes (as discussed in "*Reproduction*" above) a dragon's death gives rise to an egg, transferring the dragon's power directly to a new generation. In other cases, a dragon at the brink of death invests power into another creature—usually a dragon, but sometimes a sovereign, a sage, or an adventurer. Moreover, those who slay a dragon could seize the dragon's power.

The benefit conferred by this transfer of power is up to you. It might include one of the draconic gifts described in *chapter 2* of this book, or a charm or blessing from the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. You can also use the supernatural gifts in *Mythic Odysseys of Theros* or the Dark Gifts in *Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft* as benefits (with definite drawbacks, in the case of Dark Gifts).

***Investiture.*** A dying dragon might willingly pass on power in different ways. The most common process is for the recipient to inhale the dragon's dying breath—which often involves being subjected to at least a diminished form of the dragon's breath weapon. A gem dragon might psionically implant a gemstone in the recipient's body that carries the dragon's power. A dragon might instead lay a claw on the recipient or bequeath a piece of treasure as an embodiment of the transferred power.

***Body and Blood.*** When a dragon dies a violent death, the dragon's power might linger in the corpse for a short time. Drinking or bathing in the dragon's blood; sleeping entombed in the carcass; or consuming the dragon's heart, brain, eyes, breath-producing organ, or muscle can be an effective way of claiming the fallen creature's magical might. Using a dragon's corpse this way might be a trial in itself, as the lingering energies in the body can cause serious injury even after the dragon's death.

***Automatic Transfer.*** It's also possible for a dragon's power to transfer immediately and automatically to creatures that participate in the dragon's death or that are present when the dragon dies. A burst of power might emanate from the dragon at the moment of death, affecting each creature within 300 feet of the body. Or a fragment of power might enter every creature that has dealt damage to the dragon over the course of the dragon's life.

### Undeath
*I've never met a creature I didn't love. But I have met a few I didn't want alive.*— FizbanDespite their incredible life spans, some dragons pursue undeath to extend their existences. Others stumble into undeath unwillingly or unwittingly. Either way, an Undead dragon is a force to be reckoned with.

Dracoliches are created by cultists or necromancers who either persuade or trick a dragon into undergoing a foul ritual. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, this ritual originated with the Cult of the Dragon, whose teachings (based on a mistranslated fragment of ancient prophecy) maintain that "dead dragons will rule the world entire." The cult thus creates dracoliches as a step toward achieving that particular vision of a future paradise. Similar rites exist on other worlds, whether spread by cultists from Faerûn, invented independently, or discovered by dragons who have dracolich echoes on Faerûn.

*Chapter 6* details three additional kinds of draconic Undead. A **hollow dragon** comes into being when a metallic dragon gives up mortal life so a fragment of life essence can linger as an eternal guardian of a precious treasure or knowledge. **Draconic shards** are lingering psychic projections of psionic gem dragons. And dragons can also linger after death as **ghost dragons**.

Whatever form an Undead dragon takes, the creature's transformation ripples throughout the Material Plane. Every dragon has echoes on other worlds, and when one dragon violates the natural cycle of life and death, that dragon's echoes are often affected—particularly in the case of dracoliches. A dracolich's echoes suffer a wasting affliction that spreads out from the dracolich like a contagion. Afflicted dragons grow increasingly violent and cruel, and the physical deterioration they experience from aging accelerates. This wasting can even drive an affected dragon to seek out undeath.

The Undead Dragon Adventure Hooks table translates some of these ideas into inspiration for adventures revolving around Undead dragons.

##### Undead Dragon Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A dragon seeks help, desperate to prevent a dracolich-worshiping cult from convincing the dragon's sibling, mate, or rival to become a dracolich. |
| 2 | A dragon suffering from a wasting affliction asks the characters to travel to another world, where they must destroy an echo of that dragon who has become a dracolich. |
| 3 | A pirate crew under the command of a **ghost dragon** fights to recover the dead dragon's scattered hoard. |
| 4 | A **hollow dragon** guards an artifact meant to be used in the dire circumstances foretold in an ancient prophecy. Now the prophecy is coming to pass, but the dragon won't let the artifact be used for its intended purpose. |
| 5 | A gem dragon from another world is searching for the dragon's echo, which has become a **draconic shard**. |
| 6 | A dracolich keeps returning after being destroyed. The dracolich's connection to its echoes on other worlds is keeping its soul intact, like a phylactery, and the connection must be severed before the creature's threat can be ended. |

![[022-03-010.the-black-dracolich.webp|right|300]](The black dracolich Ebondeath is venerated by a sect of the Cult of the Dragon)

### Echoes across the Worlds
*It takes no additional work to be infinite. As a spider sees through all its eyes, dragons simply are, once and many times.*— FizbanDragons' unique connection to the magic of the Material Plane and the history of the First World gives them a mysterious link to other dragons across the myriad worlds of the Material Plane. In theory, every chromatic, metallic, and gem dragon that has ever lived has had a unique echo on every world of the Material Plane. Some of those echoes are very similar to each other, but others are more radically different.

You can use the Dragon Echo Characteristics table to help you decide what aspects of a dragon's echo are similar to the dragon you know and which are different. You can then use the other tables in this chapter (including the *Dragon Appearance*, *Dragon Mannerisms*, *Dragon Bonds*, and *Dragon Flaws and Secrets* tables), as well as the tables of personality traits and ideals in *chapter 5*, to help you elaborate the differences between one dragon and the dragon's echo.

##### Dragon Echo Characteristics
| d8 | Echo Characteristics |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Same dragon kind and age, differing only in physical appearance |
| 2 | Same dragon kind and age, differing only in a peculiar mannerism |
| 3 | Same dragon kind and age, but significantly different in personality, ideals, or alignment |
| 4 | Same dragon kind and generally alike, but older or younger by one category |
| 5 | Same age, different kind within the same family (chromatic, gem, or metallic), and similar in appearance and personality |
| 6 | Same age, different kind in a different family (with a similar breath weapon or habitat), with similar appearance but very different ideals or alignment |
| 7 | Radically different in almost every way imaginable but still bound by fate across the worlds |
| 8 | Roll again, and in addition the echo is Undead (a dracolich, **hollow dragon**, **ghost dragon**, or **draconic shard**) or a shadow dragon. |

### Gods and Religion
*Most dragons aren't what you'd call pious. To really embrace religion, one must believe one needs help.*— FizbanBahamut and Tiamat, the primordial dragons and the purported creators of the First World, are the closest things to gods among dragonkind. Since they share the same fundamental connection to the Material Plane as their dragon offspring, Bahamut and Tiamat are ontologically distinct from the gods that hail from the Outer Planes. But for practical purposes, they are divine—worshiped by mortal creatures, able to grant cleric spells to their followers, and both ageless and immortal. Since the destruction of the First World, both primordial dragons now dwell in the Outer Planes—Bahamut on Mount Celestia and Tiamat in the Nine Hells.

On many worlds, Humanoids worship Bahamut and Tiamat as gods. On Krynn, they are the greatest among the gods, though they are known there as Paladine and Takhisis and are not always pictured as dragons. In the Dawn War pantheon described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, Bahamut is revered as a god of justice and nobility, favored by paladins, while Tiamat is known as a god of greed, wealth, and vengeance.

Dragons view the primordial dragons differently. To metallic dragons, Bahamut is more like a king than a god. Individual dragons might owe Bahamut allegiance, respect him, pay tribute to him, and strive to emulate him. Similarly, chromatic dragons might fear, respect, envy, and appease Tiamat as a sovereign. But none of those attitudes and behaviors bear any resemblance in a dragon's mind to the worship that mortals offer to their gods.

![[023-03-011.bahamut.webp|right|300]](Bahamut is often accompanied by seven ancient gold dragons in his journeys on the Material Plane)

A few other dragons also command reverence from their kin. These are often greatwyrms who have undergone a sort of apotheosis, joining multiple echoes of themselves into a single powerful form. A few are ancient dragons who have cultivated their dragonsight to such a degree that they can coordinate the actions of their echoes across the Material Plane, influencing events on multiple worlds at once. Humanoids might consider these dragons gods, but as with Bahamut and Tiamat, dragons respect these figures for their wisdom, their might, their magic, and their wealth; they don't worship them. Such enlightened dragons include Aasterinian (a brass dragon who serves as a messenger for Bahamut and is sometimes identified as a god of invention), Chronepsis (a black dragon who now resides in the Outlands, sometimes imagined as a god of fate), and Tamara (a silver dragon of transcendent beneficence, described as a god of life). A number of such dragons of legend are discussed in more detail in sidebars in *chapters 5* and *6*.

Dragons are not religious by nature. They can grow to become some of the most formidable creatures in the multiverse without relying on any external power, and they learn self-sufficiency and self-interest from the moment of their hatching. They do not appeal to divine powers for aid, nor do they beseech them for mercy. That said, some dragons could be described as spiritual. A dragon might cultivate an awareness of the interconnectedness of all that exists and strive to nurture the health of the whole or to exploit that connection. But even the most spiritual dragons have a keen sense of their own importance.

### Shape-Shifting
*The time a dragon spends in a humanoid form is not directly related to our opinion of said form. In fact, dragons generally disagree with mortals about visual taste.*

*Most of you are extremely misguided. Looking glasses have not helped.*— FizbanMost metallic and gem dragons can change shape to take on a Humanoid or Beast form by the time they reach adulthood or ancient age. A few other Dragon varieties possess similar abilities (including deep dragons, described in *chapter 6*), and you can give any dragon the Change Shape action of an adult or ancient dragon without affecting the dragon's challenge rating (as noted under "*Customizing Dragons*" earlier in this chapter). Likewise, if you use the *Monster Manual* variant rule to make dragons innate spellcasters, you could give any adult or older dragon the *polymorph* spell to take on an alternate form.

Dragons typically use their shape-shifting ability to move about in the world without drawing attention to themselves. Dragons like to know as much as they can about the lands around their lairs and the inhabitants of those lands, and posing as a more innocuous creature is an easy way to gather such information. Many metallic dragons also believe they are following the example of Bahamut, who is known to wander the worlds of the Material Plane in Humanoid guise, appearing sometimes as an elderly sage or wizard, other times as a young fisher or monk. In any of these forms, he is often accompanied by seven gold dragons in the form of brilliant yellow songbirds.

Famously, Bahamut traveled the world of Krynn in the guise of a human wizard named Fizban, guiding the peoples of that world as they prepared for war against the evil forces of Tiamat. In the same way, some metallic dragons use their Humanoid forms to influence people. Since they can remain in Humanoid form indefinitely, metallic dragons often create false identities and mundane lives for themselves. Thanks to their keen intellects and strong personalities, shape-shifted dragons can easily end up in positions of leadership—either overtly as mayors, high priests, the heads of knightly orders, or crime bosses or behind the scenes as advisors, activists, or the spouses of rulers.

> ##### Dragons of Song and Steel
>The propensity of some metallic dragons to spend long periods of time in Humanoid form has led to numerous bits of folklore, including tales in which these shape-shifters are sometimes erroneously identified as unique varieties of metallic dragons.
>
>In the world of the Forgotten Realms, stories speak of "weredragons" or "song dragons," which are variously described as "beautiful humans transformed into dragons" or as a distinct variety of metallic dragon. The world of Greyhawk has legends of similar dragons, called either Greyhawk dragons or steel dragons, which are said to favor life among Humanoids in the hustle and bustle of great cities.
>
>The creatures featured in these legends are almost certainly copper, silver, or other metallic dragons who simply favored that particular form. Some dragons even seem to prefer Humanoid form to their own and delight in surrounding themselves with companions who can answer their endless questions about Humanoid art, culture, history, and politics.
>

Of course, years of careful scheming can be quickly unraveled if a shape-shifted dragon's true nature is discovered. As a result, such dragons are careful to avoid being seen in their true forms. They show great caution in dealing with adventurers or anyone else who might have the magical ability to expose their nature. And dragons who need to revert to their true form are careful to do so out of sight—or to leave no surviving witnesses.

Some metallic dragons believe that if they remain in a shape-shifted form for too long, they'll lose the ability to revert to their true form. This is probably just superstition, but many dragons claim to know of others of their kind condemned to spend the rest of a very long life trapped in Humanoid or Beast form. Because of this belief, dragons who spend prolonged periods in the guise of other creatures often find periodic excuses to venture into the wilderness, letting them stretch their wings away from prying eyes.

### Dragon Organizations
*The only thing better than getting a dragon involved...is getting five dragons involved!*— FizbanMost dragons are solitary, living alone or keeping company with only a single dragon companion or a tight family group. Occasionally, though, dragons form associations with other dragons in pursuit of a common purpose. These associations are more common among lawful dragons and center around goals broader than a single dragon's territory or concerns. This section discusses several organizations whose plots can unfold across small regions, whole worlds, or even multiple worlds.

#### Cult of the Dragon
Founded in Faerûn, the Cult of the Dragon was based on a mistranslated prophecy that "dead dragons shall rule the world entire." For most of its history, the cult has focused on creating dracoliches to fulfill this prophecy. Its members have been responsible for creating more dracoliches than any other force on the Material Plane. And thanks to the corruption that spreads between worlds whenever a dragon embraces undeath (see "*Undeath*" earlier in this chapter), the cult's influence has been tremendous.

In recent years, Tiamat has worked through a young member of the Cult of the Dragon to alter the cult's foundational beliefs. The Dragon Queen steered this prophet, named Severin, to the correct translation of the cult's foundational prophecy: "...naught will be left save shattered thrones, with no rulers but the dead. Dragons shall rule the world entire..." Guided by this new vision, Severin has worked tirelessly to bring about the ascendance to power of living dragons, even attempting to bring an avatar of Tiamat into the world to wreak havoc (and nearly succeeding).

***Dissent in the Ranks.*** Since the failure of Severin's effort to bring Tiamat into the world, the Cult of the Dragon has been sharply divided. Some of its members pursue Severin's new vision for the cult, keeping their focus on his reinterpretation of the prophecy. Others still support the prophecy's old interpretation, continuing their efforts to create dracoliches.

***Adventure Hooks.*** The Tyranny of Dragons adventure details the cult's efforts to bring Tiamat's avatar into the world. Beyond that plot, the Cult of the Dragon Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for how adventurers might encounter this sinister cult.

##### Cult of the Dragon Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A group of cultists has stolen a dragon egg, with the dual goal of hatching a minion for themselves and gaining leverage over the dragon who was caring for the egg. But the dragon wants the egg back. |
| 2 | A group of cultists is trying to access a magic portal linking the Material Plane to Tiamat's domain, hoping to break the seal that has kept the portal closed for centuries. |
| 3 | A dragon whose echo on another world has become a dracolich suffers from a wasting affliction (see "*Undeath*" above). Members of the Cult of the Dragon are trying to persuade the afflicted dragon to become a dracolich as well. |
| 4 | A dragon and a dracolich, representing the opposing factions of the Cult of the Dragon, war against each other. Their battle is devastating the region between their lairs and endangers countless innocents. |
| 5 | A group of cultists searches for all the *Orbs of Dragonkind*, planning to use them to bend dragons to their will. |
| 6 | A fringe group of cultists decides to focus on the "shattered thrones" part of the ancient prophecy and attempts to assassinate rulers and destroy their seats of power. |

![[024-03-012.an-adventurer-closes.webp|right|300]](An adventurer closes a portal, preventing an agent of Tiamat from emerging to aid the Cult of the Dragon)

#### The Chamber
A cabal of dragons called the Chamber keeps tabs on events unfolding across the world of Eberron, monitoring and manipulating the fulfillment of the ancient Draconic Prophecy. Most other creatures are merely pawns in the dragons' centuries-long schemes, their needs and lives relevant only insofar as they intersect with the Prophecy.

The Draconic Prophecy is not a single collection of oracular sayings, nor is it any kind of organized prediction of future events. Rather, the Prophecy is a map of possible futures—an outline of the complex relationships of cause and effect. Dragons of the Chamber study it not to know what the future holds, but so they can comprehend the possible consequences of any action they or others might take—consequences that might unfold over the course of centuries. From the perspective of the dragons of the Chamber, the tumultuous events of national histories are but tiny waves in a vast ocean, but those waves are often warnings of the mightier forces of the tides.

As described in *Eberron: Rising from the Last War*, the dragons of the Chamber primarily act as observers, gathering information about new aspects of the Prophecy. They are also charged with stopping any creatures attempting to use the Prophecy for their own ends, including agents of the ancient Fiends known as the Lords of Dust. That said, some members of the Chamber try to take the fulfillment of the Prophecy into their own talons, directing the future toward outcomes they desire.

***Marks of Prophecy.*** The dragons of the Chamber recognize the dragonmarks that appear on the skin of certain Humanoids on Eberron as manifestations of the Prophecy. These marks reveal nuances of the Prophecy to those who can understand them and lend symbolic weight to the actions of those who bear them—for example, a person with the Mark of Storm might fulfill the role of "a mighty storm" in the Prophecy. For this reason, agents of the Chamber are interested in the activities of dragonmarked families and heirs.

***Prophetic Dragonsight.*** Most agents of the Chamber assume the Draconic Prophecy is concerned only with the unfolding of possible futures on Eberron. A few of the organization's most ancient members, though, have developed their dragonsight enough to explore the ramifications of the Prophecy across other worlds of the Material Plane. Dragons on multiple worlds might thus act as agents of the Chamber, manipulating history on their own worlds to see whether that affects the unfolding of the Prophecy on Eberron. These elders reason that if dragons can connect their echoes across worlds, then all worlds must exist in a sort of entanglement of causality. This makes the map of possible futures infinitely more complex and tantalizing—and subject to careful manipulation.

***Adventure Hooks.*** *Eberron: Rising from the Last War* contains abundant ideas for adventures related to the Chamber's activities on Eberron. The Chamber Adventure Hooks table here suggests additional ways characters on other worlds might become entangled in the schemes and experiments of the Chamber, by way of agents whose awareness extends beyond Eberron.

##### Chamber Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An agent of the Chamber has plundered the research of an eccentric sage whose work is widely considered nonsense, suggesting that something important is hidden in the sage's notes. |
| 2 | A dragon of the Chamber is convinced that dragonmarked Humanoids on Eberron have echoes on other worlds of the Material Plane, and seeks ways to identify them. |
| 3 | A dragon of the Chamber draws the characters from one Material Plane world to another, trying to glean information about the Prophecy by examining the relationship between the two worlds. |
| 4 | A member of the Chamber seeks to hire the characters to explore a dungeon that was recently discovered behind a sigil-inscribed stone seal. |
| 5 | A member of the Chamber believes that one of the characters could serve as "the Child of Winter" (or some similar title) mentioned in the Prophecy and tries to manipulate the character into bringing the terms of the Prophecy to pass. |
| 6 | A Fiend tries to trick the characters into slaying a dragon belonging to the Chamber. |

#### Hidecarved Dragons
On worlds across the Material Plane, dragons gather in small communities of three to five called lauths. These dragons share a common territory and hoard, live under a strict code of discipline, and devote themselves to a common goal. Their most notable feature, though, is their practice of carving arcane sigils of protection into their scales.

***Common Purpose.*** Dragons most often form a lauth when they identify a shared goal whose completion requires the sustained effort of a diverse group of dragons. The Lauth Goals table offers a few examples.

##### Lauth Goals
| d6 | Goal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Support the establishment of a powerful empire to maintain order in the lauth's territory |
| 2 | Bring about the downfall of a powerful empire |
| 3 | End the influence of Aberrations originating in the Underdark |
| 4 | Seek out and destroy hundreds of cursed magic items created by an ancient lich |
| 5 | Destroy an archdevil, a demon prince, a powerful Celestial, or an archfey whose extraplanar influence is altering the lauth's territory |
| 6 | Bring about (or prevent) the fulfillment of a prophecy uttered by an ancient dragon centuries ago |

***Diverse Dragons.*** The hidecarved dragons of a lauth share a goal but often have little else in common. By design, each member of a lauth is usually a different kind of dragon, bringing particular abilities and perspective to bear on the group's goal. Likewise, a lauth's dragons cover a range of ages, ensuring that the lauth's traditions outlive its oldest members.

***Engraved Wards.*** The arcane markings carved into hidecarved dragons' scales are magical protections, intended to make the dragons more resilient against the threats they might face in carrying out the lauth's purpose. The longer dragons stay with a lauth, the more wards they receive. Most hidecarved dragons have one of these wards plus an additional ward for each age category above wyrmling. You can roll for these effects on the Hidecarved Wards table or choose effects as you wish.

![[025-03-013.hidecarved-dragons.webp|right|300]](Hidecarved dragons adorn their scales with mystic words)

##### Hidecarved Wards
| d6 | Ward Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Immutability**. The dragon is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form. |
| 2 | **Inscrutability**. The dragon is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain its intentions or sincerity have disadvantage. |
| 3 | **Magic Resistance**. The dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. |
| 4 | **Damage Resistance**. The dragon has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. |
| 5 | **Additional Resistance**. The dragon has resistance to one type of damage. Roll a d8, rerolling if you get a damage type the dragon is already resistant or immune to: 1, acid; 2, cold; 3, fire; 4, lightning; 5, necrotic: 6, psychic; 7, radiant; 8, thunder. |
| 6 | **Death Ward**. The dragon can cast the *death ward* spell on itself and regains the ability to do so after a long rest. |

***Mystic Markings.*** The sigils engraved in the scales of a hidecarved dragon echo across the Material Plane similarly to how a dragon becoming Undead does. When a dragon joins a lauth, the dragon's echoes on other worlds gain a measure of the magical protection from the dragon's engraved markings. Some of those echoes accept this inexplicable boon without questioning it. Others investigate the mystery and might end up awakening their dragonsight and discovering the nature of the lauths affecting them—perhaps eventually founding their own lauths with other dragons in a similar situation.

***Adventure Hooks.*** The Hidecarved Dragons Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for how this order of dragons might get caught up in the affairs of adventurers.

##### Hidecarved Dragons Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A hidecarved dragon hires the characters to undertake a quest in pursuit of the lauth's goal. |
| 2 | A lauth becomes convinced that their goal demands the destruction of the characters. |
| 3 | A lauth unexpectedly aids the characters' quest, which aligns with the hidecarved dragons' goal. |
| 4 | A lauth opposes the characters' quest, which is at odds with the hidecarved dragons' goal. |
| 5 | Following reports of a dangerous dragon in the region, the characters discover the dragon is part of a lauth whose goal is worth aiding. |
| 6 | A dragon asks the characters to help figure out why mysterious arcane markings have suddenly appeared on the dragon's scales. Solving this puzzle might mean journeying to another world or finding a way to help awaken the dragon's dragonsight. |

#### Inheritors of the First World
"Breathe, dragons: you are inheritors, / ruling the wreck of the First World's destruction." To some dragons, this closing couplet of "Elegy for the First World" is not merely an exhortation to dominate the Material Plane, but a call to recreate the original world of the dragon gods. The draconic members of an apocalyptic sect called the Inheritors of the First World believe the cataclysm that destroyed the original creation and brought the myriad worlds of the Material Plane into being can be undone. In fact, they teach that the Material Plane's worlds must be destroyed and recombined so the creation can be brought to its final, glorious purpose.

The goal of the Inheritors of the First World might seem unattainable; at the very least, achieving it would almost certainly require the intervention of both Bahamut and Tiamat. But they would be opposed by the countless gods who are deeply invested in the Material Plane as it is, and the two primordial dragons have not coordinated their efforts toward a common purpose since before the destruction of the First World. Still, the Inheritors of the First World are extremely knowledgeable about the multiple worlds of the Material Plane, the connections between them, and means of traveling from one world to another.

***Awakening Dragonsight.*** The work of the Inheritors of the First World consists largely of developing dragonsight, which is latent in all dragons. Leaders within the group have perfected multiple techniques—from alchemical brews to elaborate rites—to help spark the first flickering awareness of a dragon's echoes on other worlds. They freely perform these techniques on any dragons who yearn for this birthright, believing that empowering dragonsight even in dragons with no intention of joining the order ultimately helps advance their cause. A dragon who decides to be initiated into the sect develops a basic awareness of multiple echoes and begins to communicate directly with them in a process akin to lucid dreaming by the time they undergo initiation.

Any dragons with well-developed dragonsight, but especially members of the Inheritors of the First World, can have the following trait, representing the ability to call on the knowledge of their echoes across the Material Plane:

>***Dragonsight Revelation.*** The dragon can add half its proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check it makes that uses a skill with which it lacks proficiency.

***Reverence for Sardior.*** A central tenet of the Inheritors of the First World is that a reborn Sardior will ultimately inspire Bahamut and Tiamat to join forces once again and return to the task of creation. Many members of the sect are gem dragons, who believe Sardior's fractured consciousness is embedded in their own minds, and who work to cultivate dragonsight in other gem dragons. However, even chromatic and metallic members of the group revere the long-dead Ruby Dragon. Sardior is their once and future sovereign—a leader who has departed for a time, but who will return to bring enlightenment, comfort, and salvation to dragonkind.

***Adventure Hooks.*** The Inheritors of the First World Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for how characters might become involved with this apocalyptic sect.

##### Inheritors of the First World Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A fleeing foe disappears into a magic portal linked to another world of the Material Plane. When the characters follow this enemy, they draw the attention of dragons who want to know more about the world they came from. |
| 2 | The lair of a gem dragon turns out to be a magical nexus containing portals linked to the lairs of the dragon's echoes on several other worlds. |
| 3 | The characters discover an enormous ruby deep in the Underdark. When word of their find gets out, the gem becomes the target of thieves and eventually of dragons who believe it is the heart of Sardior and a key to the Ruby Dragon's return. |
| 4 | A dragon offers to pay the characters handsomely if they travel to another world. There, they must make contact with the dragon's echo and solve the mystery of why their patron has been unable to learn dragonsight. |
| 5 | Priests or dragon servitors of Bahamut send the characters to combat the Inheritors of the First World, worried that any attempt to restore Bahamut and Tiamat's primal creation will anger the gods and rekindle the ancient wars between dragons and Humanoids. |
| 6 | Dragons establish a permanent portal connecting two worlds of the Material Plane, establishing an exciting era of discovery and trade between them. But the longer the portal remains open, the larger it grows, seemingly drawing the two worlds together into a catastrophic collision. |

## Followers
*Certain dragons act like they're in danger of forgetting their own grandeur unless they're surrounded with beings they can demean. I've found, on the contrary, that those scorned by others often have the most to teach us.*— FizbanDragons often take on followers to help them acquire treasure and protect their hoards and lairs. Assigning such subordinates to a dragon is a matter of encounter and adventure design. As you craft an encounter, an adventure, or an entire campaign around a dragon, you can decide how many creatures are in the dragon's service.

### Dragon Relationships
Some dragons rule sprawling criminal organizations devoted to plundering the surrounding region and swelling the dragons' hoards. Others govern peaceful and prosperous towns where taxes and tariffs provide them a steady stream of income. Still others set themselves up as warlords, emperors, or gods.

The sections that follow present a variety of relationships dragons could have to their followers (whether the followers are aware their leader is a dragon or not). Each style of relationship suggests a variety of adventure possibilities, as shown on the *Relationships and Adventures* table at the end of this section.

#### Business Owner
A dragon might invest wealth into a business to multiply the investment. The dragon's followers are employees, who might be exploited because of their weakness relative to the dragon or treated fairly because of the dragon's kindness. Employees who don't perform up to the dragon's standards are released from service—whether that means being sent off to find other jobs or becoming the dragon's next meal. Depending on the size of the commercial enterprise, the dragon might have subordinates who are responsible for certain aspects of the business. These subordinates might be related to the dragon (younger dragons or perhaps half-dragons), or simply employees who have proven trustworthy and resourceful.

#### Companion
Dragons sometimes interact with mortal folk as if they were equals—particularly dragons who enjoy taking on Humanoid form. They might create a fellowship or collegial society and treat their companions with kindness and respect. These allies are often unaware that their activities are oriented around the dragon's purposes, becoming unwitting pawns in the dragon's plans. Deep attachments might form between the dragon and these companions, who can become disillusioned when the dragon's true nature is revealed.

#### Crime Boss
A dragon takes charge of a criminal enterprise, accumulating wealth through illegal activities that might range from theft and racketeering to smuggling and illegal gambling. Like any other gang leader, the dragon has little tolerance for rivals and none at all for disloyalty among minions. Various lieutenants—which might include younger dragons or half-dragons related to the boss—might hold responsibility over particular segments of the criminal enterprise.

#### Emperor
Rather than existing on the shadowy fringes of society, a dragon might rule a nation as an absolute monarch. The dragon's word is law—but depending on the dragon, this might be the law of a benevolent autocrat with a cadre of wise advisors or of a dictatorial tyrant who governs based on whim. Taxes might be funneled into the dragon's hoard, but some dragons in this position regard the collective wealth of their empire as part of their hoard and feel no need to consolidate it in specific locations.

A dragon emperor might accept fealty from lesser sovereigns and nobles who govern parts of the realm in the dragon's name, or the dragon might install dragon or half-dragon offspring in the highest echelons of government. Depending on the size of the domain, the dragon might have thousands or even millions of loyal subjects.

An emperor might rule openly in dragon form, which discourages aggressive neighbors from provoking the dragon's wrath. Often, though, dragons adopt a Humanoid guise to rule, constructing elaborate ruses (posing as their own children and grandchildren, for example) that allow them to reign across multiple generations.

The size of a dragon's territory is irrelevant to the "emperor" role. A dragon who acts as a mayor for a small frontier town has the same kind of relationship with the populace as one who rules a continent-spanning nation.

![[026-03-014.to-kugluk.webp|right|300]](To Kugluk, the fiery breath of his "Great Uncle" is a toasty blessing)

#### God
Some dragons demand not just service but worship from their minions. Among Humanoid creatures, kobolds are most likely to treat their dragon patrons as deities, since they typically see dragons as idealized versions of themselves. They bring sacrifices of food and treasure to their dragon gods, indulge in various forms of worship (including groveling when evil dragons are involved), and create tales and hymns to stoke their deities' egos. But other Humanoids might also feel (or at least feign) religious devotion to a dragon, sometimes even manifesting magical power as a result of their piety. (The **dragon blessed** follower, described in *chapter 6*, is an example of a Humanoid manifesting such power.)

Dragons can be benevolent patrons who genuinely care for those who worship them, scheming manipulators who view devotion as a means of domination and control, or something in between. All dragon gods, however, have devoted minions who are difficult to sway from their service. One key to this devotion is the fact that a dragon's power is more concrete than the power of most gods; the supernatural fear inspired by a dragon's presence readily translates into reverence among the followers.

#### Noble
Some dragons aspire to a life of luxury, surrounded by minions whose primary purpose is to ensure their every need is met immediately. A dragon living in Humanoid form might actually claim a noble title and hobnob with other members of the aristocracy. However, dragons in this category often prefer to avoid the hassles of secrets and disguises, focusing instead on extravagance—and demanding treasure as tribute from nearby settlements. Their minions are menial servants, responsible for bringing them food, keeping them comfortable, tending to their lairs, and warding off intruders. One or more of these servitors might have the responsibility of managing the rest of a dragon noble's staff on the dragon's behalf, but even such a steward has little autonomy and must cater to the dragon's every whim.

#### Parental Figure
Some dragons treat their followers and minions like their children. These followers might be a dragon's devoted dragon or half-dragon offspring, but it's more likely that these minions are a family the dragon has adopted out of generosity, compassion, or manipulation.

Unlike most other relationships between dragons and followers, this one is primarily about the well-being and advancement of the followers, not the dragon. Dragons are notoriously egotistical even when they're benevolent, but some make sacrifices for weaker creatures they see as family, regardless of their exact relationship to the creatures.

To outsiders, dragons in this sort of relationship might be mistaken for pets or servitors. But dragons never forget their own power and importance, even when helping other creatures, and dragons' "children" might face serious consequences if they forget who's in charge.

#### Patron
Dragons might take on the role of patron, using a fraction of their tremendous wealth to support the arts, groups of freelance adventurers, or important causes. Such dragons' minions might include artists painting frescoes in their lairs, musicians composing chorales for the dragons to enjoy, poets writing odes in praise of their draconic lieges, and adventurers seeking priceless treasures to add to the dragons' hoards. Dragons who spend a lot of time in Humanoid form are often drawn to this role, and their minions might have no idea that their generous patrons are actually dragons.

If you want to have a dragon act as a patron for a group of adventurers, look to the "*Group Patrons*" chapter of *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*. You can use the information there to create a dragon filling this role in your campaign. Dragons naturally fall into the category of "*ancient being*," as described in that chapter, but depending on their roles and personalities, they might act more like another kind of patron.

#### Teacher
The oldest dragons are deep wellsprings of knowledge, drawing on vast experience that might extend beyond a single world of the Material Plane to encompass multiple realities. Though some dragons hoard their knowledge like treasure, others enjoy passing their knowledge on to other creatures. Such dragons might establish schools or monasteries, take on individual students or groups of disciples, or pose as Humanoid scholars to teach in universities. These dragons might believe that educating lesser creatures is the responsibility of the great. Others want a higher class of minion and believe education is the best way to achieve that. Still others simply enjoy teaching or believe the world is improved by having an educated populace.

Monks who follow the Way of the Ascendant Dragon (see *chapter 1*) might follow a dragon teacher or could train in monasteries established by dragons in past generations.

#### Warlord
The combination of ego and intellect can lead a dragon to become a military leader. Minions help keep the dragon's territory in an iron grip, bringing the spoils of conquest and the tribute of conquered peoples to swell the dragon's hoard. Those minions might be Humanoids, violent monsters, or a mix of both, forming an alliance under the dragon's rule.

Depending on the dragon's age and the power and number of minions involved, a dragon warlord might be a local menace or an imperial conqueror.

### Dragons' Minions
The magic that suffuses a dragon and the dragon's lair can sometimes extend to encompass the dragon's minions as well. To reflect a minion's relationship to its draconic master, add one or more of these traits to the minion's stat block.

>***Explosive Minion.*** When the minion dies, it releases a burst of energy in a 5-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area takes 1d8 damage of the same type its master's breath weapon deals.

>***Minion's Mind.*** The minion can't be compelled to act in a way contrary to its master's instructions.

>***Sacrificial Minion.*** When the minion dies, its master regains hit points equal to four times the minion's challenge rating, as long as the master is within 60 feet of it.

>***Selfless Bodyguard.*** When an attack hits its master and the minion is within 5 feet of its master, the minion can use its reaction to make the attack hit itself instead.

>***Telepathic Minion.*** The minion and its master can communicate telepathically with each other, as long as they are on the same plane of existence.

## Dragon Encounters
*Often, a dragon who is merely hungry is perceived as angry. The outcome for the observing creatures is the same, but I think it's important to clarify motives.*— FizbanWhether you're crafting a whole adventure around a dragon or just want to throw a dragon with an interesting personality into the party's path, how do you put a dragon to best use in an encounter? Start by answering these four questions:

- **Is the encounter a goal or an obstacle?** Dragons (particularly adult and older dragons) are well suited to being the climactic encounter in an adventure, and slaying evil dragons is a well-established quest in literature and legend. But you can also use a dragon as just one of many encounters to overcome in an adventure.
- **What's the goal of the encounter?** Not every encounter with a dragon needs to involve combat, let alone an all-out fight to the death. Maybe the characters are trying to help a kobold Keeper of Dragons retrieve a wyrmling kidnapped by a gang of goblins (as in "*The Sunless Citadel*," an adventure found in *Tales from the Yawning Portal*). In this case, fighting the dragon might be necessary if the dragon doesn't want to return, but killing the creature is undesirable. Or perhaps the characters are seriously outmatched by the dragon, and their only reasonable goal is to escape the encounter alive.
- **Is the encounter in the dragon's lair?** Fighting in a dragon's lair is more likely to mean a fight to the death, since the dragon will be less keen on fleeing an encounter that goes badly and more determined to hunt down adventurers who flee after seeing the inside of the dragon's home. This scenario also means an adult or older dragon has access to lair actions. In contrast, a dragon fighting outdoors can more easily fly out of reach of opponents on the ground. *Chapters 4* and *5* feature information and maps to help you build encounters in and around a dragon's lair.
- **Is the dragon alone or accompanied by minions?** With their legendary actions, adult and ancient dragons are designed to be challenging encounters all on their own, but even a younger dragon can be a handful as a solo enemy. On the other hand, adding minions to a dragon encounter can divert the characters' attention away from the dragon and make a combat encounter more interesting—as well as more dangerous. See "*Followers*" earlier in this chapter for ideas about how the relationship between dragon and minions can impact an encounter.

With these four questions in mind, you can look to the Dragon Encounter Complications table for suggestions of quirks, special effects, and unusual situations that can make any dragon encounter more interesting and exciting.

![[027-03-015.an-encounter-with-a-dragon.webp|right|300]](An encounter with a dragon can be devastating to people and property alike)

##### Dragon Encounter Complications
| d20 | Complication |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The dragon has no interest in fighting and tries to avoid the characters, until they anger the dragon through significantly injury or insult. |
| 2 | The dragon is too bored to fight and offers the characters a tiny amount of treasure if they'll leave. |
| 3 | The dragon hates a certain type of character (sneaky rogues, healers, or heavily armored fighters, perhaps) and directs at least one attack each round at such a character. |
| 4 | The dragon tries to drive the characters off by emotionally hurting or humiliating them—threatening something they obviously care about, damaging their equipment, insulting them, or showing how ineffectual their attacks are. |
| 5 | The dragon has a way to call for help hidden deep inside the lair, such as a magic horn that summons minions, an *iron flask* with a powerful Fiend inside, or a magic portal to an echo's lair. The characters must prevent the dragon from summoning aid or face a new threat. |
| 6 | The dragon is desperately trying to protect a particular treasure, one or more eggs, or perhaps a minion, bargaining to protect this treasure and flying into a rage if it is harmed. |
| 7 | The previous occupant of the dragon's lair left behind a curse, a trap, or a lingering spirit that clever characters can turn against the dragon. |
| 8 | The dragon's lair is almost impossible to navigate without access to one or more of the dragon's special movement modes (typically flight, but possibly burrowing, swimming, or climbing). |
| 9 | It's been so long since anyone has dared to intrude on the dragon's lair that the dragon is more interested in showing off the lair—and impressive lair actions—than in doing serious harm to the characters. If the characters escape and spread stories of the dragon's grandeur, so much the better. |
| 10 | When the dragon is agitated, the regional effects that alter the terrain around the lair create visible changes around the dragon each round. |
| 11 | Factions and grudges within the ranks of the dragon's minions erupt when the characters challenge the dragon, resulting in infighting that might tip the odds in the main battle in either direction. |
| 12 | A feature in the dragon's lair has an unpredictable magical effect, perhaps similar to a *wand of wonder*, a sorcerer's Wild Magic Surge, or a *dungeon trick* as described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. The dragon avoids the feature unless the encounter is going badly, then either activates the feature or tries to goad the characters into doing so. |
| 13 | Spell effects and breath weapons used inside the dragon's lair cause dramatic destruction, including chasms opening up, ceilings collapsing, pillars toppling, and other effects that can damage or hinder the characters and the dragon equally. |
| 14 | The dragon has a rival who notices the characters approaching the dragon's lair and keeps tabs on the fight. This rival might step in to help the characters or the dragon, depending on the circumstances, or might ambush the characters when they leave the dragon's lair. |
| 15 | The dragon takes tremendous pleasure in adopting Humanoid form and pretending to be a minion, groveling and sniveling when intruders enter the lair and claiming that the dragon is away. |
| 16 | The dragon's only goal is to learn a key piece of information about the characters' larger goals and then escape. |
| 17 | The dragon enjoys combat, roaring in appreciation each time the characters pull off effective attacks or flashy spells. But if seriously hurt, the dragon quickly calls for a truce. |
| 18 | Each round of combat with the dragon, the characters catch an eerie glimpse of another world where one of the dragon's echoes is active. |
| 19 | The dragon has a plan to feign death in case of attack—apparently being buried in a cave-in, tumbling into a deep chasm, drowning in lava, or some similarly dramatic exit. After escaping, the dragon plots revenge. |
| 20 | At the same time the characters are confronting the dragon, another group of adventurers is confronting one of the dragon's echoes on another world. Halfway through the fight, either the dragons or the characters and the other adventurers switch places. |

## Dragon Adventures
*Dragons are not in your world. You are in theirs.*— FizbanWhen you want a dragon encounter to be the goal or focal point of an entire adventure, how do you craft that adventure to highlight the dragon's importance, grandeur, and terrifying power? When you're using the adventure hooks in this book, dragons will fall broadly into three roles: monster, schemer, or power. Think about those categories as you consider the role you want a dragon to play in your adventure.

### Dragon as Monster
For all their vast power, great intellect, and range of possible motivations, dragons are often simple creatures at heart. They want food, a secure lair, and treasure. Many tropes of the fantasy genre revolve around dealing with a dragon who has become too monstrous and putting an end to the danger the dragon poses to peoples and civilizations.

Three basic goals can provide the framework for a monstrous dragon adventure:

- **Stop the Attacks** A dragon is causing problems, and the only solution is to get rid of the dragon. The dragon might be terrorizing the area near the lair, perhaps burning farmland and devouring livestock, demanding tribute from a village, or holding captives for ransom. Alternatively, a dragon might have established a new lair in the remote wilderness, driving other monsters out of the region and straight into inhabited lands. Or a dragon could be a pawn in a greater villain's schemes, perhaps a warlord who has acquired one of the *Orbs of Dragonkind*. It might be possible to drive the dragon off or somehow change the dragon's behavior, but sometimes killing the dragon is the only option.
- **Reclaim the Dragon's Lair** A dragon has displaced an entire population to make a lair in the ruins of what was once a great city or stronghold. The people displaced want their home back, so the dragon must be removed. Killing the dragon is not necessarily the goal, but it's certainly one way to solve the problem.
- **Acquire the Dragon's Treasure** The dragon's hoard contains unimaginable wealth—or perhaps one powerful artifact the characters desperately need to achieve some other goal. Slaying the dragon might be one option, but sneaking into the lair and stealing what the characters seek is another. The characters could even bargain with the dragon to acquire the needed item. Alternatively, a dragon might seek adventurers to recover items stolen from the dragon's hoard—with a threat that local folk will suffer if the characters fail.

![[028-03-016.sometimes-the-only-solution.webp|right|300]](Sometimes the only solution is to slay the dragon)

An adventure featuring a dragon in a monster's role lends itself to a location-based structure. That location is likely the dragon's lair, since it's difficult to pin a dragon down for an all-out fight in most other sites. You can use one of the lair maps in *chapter 5* of this book as the key location for such an adventure, fleshing the site out with features and inhabitants using the *guidelines* in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

### Dragon as Schemer
Most of the adventure hooks in this book involve the schemes a dragon might put into motion over the course of a long life, potentially using followers as agents in the world. In practice, many of a schemer dragon's goals might be the same as a monstrous dragon's: acquiring food, securing a lair, and adding to a hoard. But other plots might revolve around acquiring minions, advancing the cause of a draconic faction, building the dragon's prestige, working for the well-being of dragonkind as a whole, or altering the nature of the world and its magic.

A dragon's schemes become the basis for an adventure when they intersect with the characters' lives. Most directly, the characters might be asked to aid the dragon's schemes or to oppose them. The Cross Purposes table provides inspiration to help you turn dragon-related adventure hooks into adventures that impact the characters in your game.

##### Cross-Purposes
| d6 | The Dragon's Schemes... |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | ...directly target one or more characters. The adventure begins when the dragon or the dragon's minions confront the characters. |
| 2 | ...threaten a character's bond or an NPC who's important to one or more characters. |
| 3 | ...challenge a character's ideal or exploit a flaw. The character might hear rumors of the dragon's activity, spurring them into action. |
| 4 | ...trap the characters between clashing forces. |
| 5 | ...create an opportunity for a character to pursue a personal goal. |
| 6 | ...cause an accident or catastrophe that threatens the characters. |

An adventure featuring a dragon's schemes often works best as an *event-based adventure*, as described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Whether the dragon is the villain, a patron, or an interested bystander, flesh out the dragon's personality, goals, and other traits using the tables and suggestions in this chapter and *chapter 5*. The dragon's lair might be a key location for the adventure (perhaps using a map from chapter 5), but the dragon's schemes could lead the characters anywhere—even to other worlds and planes of existence.

### Dragon as Power
In some places, dragons are more than monsters or masterminds. They are movers and shakers whose desires shape the course of history. A powerful dragon's schemes impact the characters because those schemes impact the world as a whole, not because the dragon is interested in the characters individually—at least not initially. As the characters become powers in their own right, dragons are more likely to take personal notice of them.

The "*Dragon Campaigns*" section that follows discusses the world-ranging implications of putting dragons in positions of power and central story importance in your game. When crafting individual adventures in the context of such a campaign, take standard adventure hooks (in this book or elsewhere) and dial them up—amplifying the scale and significance of a dragon's schemes to make those plots fit the dragon's stature in the world. Imagine the dragon's hoard on the scale of a national treasury. Think of the dragon's minions as the entire nation or religion that owes the dragon allegiance.

Adventures at this scale might involve dragons as villains or as patrons, and they might well involve multiple dragons in conflict with each other. The characters might loyally serve one dragon in opposition to another, or they might attempt to play multiple dragons against one another—perhaps earning the ire of them all.

![[029-03-017.in-the-heart.webp|right|300]](In the heart of the jungle, the black greatwyrm Rhashaak keeps watch over a ruined city)

## Dragon Campaigns
Dragons occupy a prominent place in most D&D worlds, but in some realms, they are central to a world's story. Consider these three examples.

![[030-03-018.laurana-and-kitiara.webp|right|300]](Laurana and Kitiara—generals and dragonriders in opposing armies—battle in the temple of the Dragon Queen)

- **Krynn** The home of the Dragonlance setting is the battleground for an unending conflict between Bahamut and Tiamat. Tiamat commands armies of draconians (described in *chapter 6*) formed from the corrupted eggs of metallic dragons, while heroes and villains alike ride mighty dragons into battle.
- **Council of Wyrms** The Io's Blood isles are a vast domain governed by an assembly of ancient wyrms representing eighty-eight clans of chromatic, metallic, and gem dragons. The council's subjects include dozens of Humanoid peoples, some of whom serve as closely bonded aides to dragon masters.
- **Tarkir** In the multiverse of the Magic: The Gathering trading card game, five dragonlords rule supreme over the world of Tarkir. After centuries of battle between Humanoid clans and the ancient dragonlords and their broods, the dragons triumphed and claimed dominion over the clans, which now bear the dragons' names.

If you want to build a campaign that puts dragons in a similarly prominent role, consider any of the following options.

### Campaign Events
The *Dungeon Master's Guide* includes a discussion of *world-shaking events* that might define turning points at the start, middle, or end of a campaign. One way to give dragons a prominent role in your campaign is to apply a draconic twist to any of these events.

![[031-03-019.a-half-dragon-conqueror.webp|right|300]](A half-dragon conqueror acquiring an Orb of Dragonkind can throw a world into chaos)

- **Rise or Fall of a Leader or an Era** A powerful dragon establishing a new lair in a region can be a singularly impactful event. Likewise, the death of an ancient dragon can cause dramatic changes in the world. The balance of power shifts. Established territories are suddenly contested or might be undefended against other perils. The dragon's hoard represents tremendous wealth flowing through a single region. Entire populations of Humanoids or monsters might move in or out of the dragon's territory.
- **Cataclysmic Disaster** A dragon rampaging through inhabited lands can be worse than any natural disaster. What has stirred the dragon's wrath? Will these rampages continue? What might appease the creature?
- **Assault or Invasion** A dragon might attack a stronghold of civilization, or an army marching under Tiamat's banner with dragon riders wheeling overhead could begin the conquest of a neighboring realm. Or a dragon's minions might launch an attack in preparation for the dragon establishing a new lair.
- **Rebellion, Revolution, Overthrow** A dragon who is a political or religious leader might face a rebellion. Another dragon might even rise up to lead the freedom fighters.
- **Extinction or Depletion** If dragons are on the verge of extinction, the last survivors might become extremely important to your campaign. Alternatively, people might have long believed dragons to be extinct, only to be shocked when one or more of these mythical creatures emerge from hiding or a long hibernation. What drove them away, and what is bringing them back? Another possibility is that dragons are responsible for the near-extinction of some other kind of creature or the depletion of a resource. What if gold or magic items are scarce because dragons have collected almost all such wealth in their hoards?
- **New Organization** The new organization might be one of the dragon organizations described earlier in this chapter or a dragon faction similar to those discussed in the next section. Alternatively, any apparently ordinary organization might have a dragon at its head—a shape-shifter dragon leading a thieves' guild, perhaps, or a devout dragon stirring up zealots in Bahamut's name.
- **Discovery, Expansion, Invention** The discovery in question might involve dragons directly. People might have only just learned that dragons exist, discovered the enormous wealth stored in their hoards, or learned of a magical reaction that can be sparked by the use of dragon blood or scales. Alternatively, dragons might be among the creatures competing to possess or control a new discovery.
- **Prediction, Omen, Prophecy** A prophecy might deal with any of the other kinds of events described here, with dragons as its focus. Alternatively, the prophecy might be uttered by a dragon or read and interpreted primarily by dragons (like the Draconic Prophecy in the world of Eberron).

### Dragon Factions
Draconic factions and the conflicts between them can provide a useful framework to organize your entire campaign around. Characters might swear their allegiance to a dragon or trade their services to dragons in exchange for membership in a draconic faction. By joining one dragon's faction, characters might end up locked in bitter strife with a different faction—and characters who join different dragon factions might have to carefully balance the needs of those factions against the goals of their party.

The different ways dragons can be categorized suggest numerous approaches to organizing dragon factions in your world.

#### The Metallic Orders
Perhaps the chromatic dragons in your world are a force of chaos, with five factions of metallic dragons shouldering the responsibility for organizing Humanoid forces to battle their chromatic kin. These factions are devoted to common goals—constraining the rampages of the chromatic dragons and limiting Tiamat's influence in the world—but they have different methods, adhere to different ideals, and attract different kinds of members. The Silver Order might be a chivalric order that attracts paladins and fighters, holds its members to the highest standards of behavior, and wields cold magic. The Brass Order could be a loose affiliation of good-hearted scoundrels, including rogues and bards, who favor fire magic and trickery.

An adventuring party might include members of any or all of the five Metallic Orders, each concerned with advancing the cause of their own order while cooperating in pursuit of common goals.

#### The Scaled Circles
Alternatively, each family of dragons—chromatic, metallic, and gem—could be represented by a single faction. Each draconic faction has a particular set of goals that doesn't necessarily put it in direct conflict with the other two factions, but that doesn't always inspire cooperation. For example, the Chromatic Circle might focus on self-aggrandizement, as each member of the faction tries to amass as much wealth and power as possible. The Gem Circle, by contrast, might be dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, while the Metallic Circle is more altruistic, working to further the advancement of entire societies and civilizations.

Some groups of characters might all affiliate with a single circle, while others might include members of different circles. Different affiliations don't necessarily create conflict within a party, though. Rather, those affiliations create a potentially interesting tension between individual goals and the goals of the party as a whole.

#### Dragon Overlords
Your world might have numerous dragon overlords—one for each kind of metallic, chromatic, and gem dragon, and possibly for deep dragons, dragon turtles, faerie dragons, moonstone dragons, and shadow dragons. These overlords are the oldest and most powerful of their kinds, and all other dragons of the same kind owe allegiance to them. In addition, Humanoids who know what's good for them give their allegiance to a dragon overlord in exchange for the dragon's protection. The result might be a feudal society, where dragons fill the highest ranks of the aristocracy.

In such a setting, characters need to decide how they fit into this system of fealty. Some characters might swear allegiance to a dragon overlord and end up as important agents enforcing that dragon's will in the world—perhaps even to the point of joining a war against a different overlord. Or they could remain independent, traveling from one dragon's domain to another and dealing with the complex and sometimes violent political conflicts among overlords. If different characters owe allegiance to different dragons, they might cooperate smoothly for a while but then find themselves in conflict when tensions erupt between the overlords. Such characters might then be put in the position of trying to make peace between the dragons—before they're commanded to go to war against each other!

#### Other Organizing Principles
Dragon factions can be based on many other aspects of dragon identity in addition to those above. The five dragon-ruled clans of Tarkir, for example, each identify with one aspect of draconic nature—the scale, the fang, the claw, the wing, and the eye, representing endurance, ruthlessness, savagery, speed, and cunning, respectively. You could also create factions based around the damage types dealt by different dragons' breath weapons, so a fire-based faction would include red, gold, and brass dragons, while green dragons would have a poison-based faction all to themselves. The gem dragons would also be unique in this system.

Alternatively, you could build draconic factions around ideals and goals that aren't specifically draconic, perhaps applying a dragon overlay to the ten guilds of Ravnica or Humanoid factions active in Faerûn—such the Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet, the Emerald Enclave, the Lords' Alliance, and the Zhentarim, all of which have appeared in a number of D&D adventures.

### Dragon Gods
Moving from the realm of temporal power to the spiritual domain, dragons can also fill the role of gods in a campaign world, elevated to a central role in the beliefs and myths of your setting. The two most important gods in the Dragonlance setting—Paladine and Takhisis—are identified with Bahamut and Tiamat, though they are not always worshiped in dragon form. Similarly, the gods of the Sovereign Host and the Dark Six in Eberron are sometimes described as dragons and might be dragons who ascended to godhood.

If the gods are distant from their mortal worshipers in your campaign, making those gods dragons is largely an aesthetic choice that reinforces the importance of dragons. Perhaps the high priests of the gods are also dragons, or they could be draconians (described in *chapter 6*), dragonborn, or half-dragons. Anyone with draconic ancestry or magic might be viewed as carrying a divine blessing in such a setting, and actual dragons would be regarded with reverential awe.

On the other hand, the dragon gods of your campaign might be ever present in the world and fully involved in the lives of their worshipers. You could reimagine the gods of Theros (detailed in *Mythic Odysseys of Theros*) as dragons, so shining Heliod becomes a gold dragon, Erebos becomes a black dracolich, Thassa is a dragon turtle, and so on. These dragon gods might grant supernatural gifts to their followers in exchange for devotion, potentially even transforming their favored ones into dragonborn. You could draw on the supernatural gifts described in *chapter 2* as well as the *piety benefits* detailed in *Mythic Odysseys of Theros* for inspiration.

![[032-03-020.tiamats-emergence.webp|right|300]](Tiamat's emergence from Avernus could define the course of a campaign)

#### Dragons of Myth
Even if you don't elevate dragons to the status of gods in your campaign, these creatures might still have a mythic role to play in the world, granting them a supernatural significance. Consider these examples:

- **Artifact of Law** When an artifact called the Rod of Law was shattered into seven parts during the Battle of Pesh, seven ancient metallic dragons were assigned to be the guardians of its fragments. Even sundered, this mighty artifact was so powerful that great cities sprang up near the dragon lairs that house the fragments, forming the centers of civilization. The dragons are patrons of the seven cities, and their roles as guardians of the artifact are all but forgotten.
- **Cult of a Dead God** At the dawn of creation, the gods of this world slew another divine being—perhaps their tyrannical parent or one of their kin who betrayed them. They cut this being's body into five pieces, each of which was fed to a different chromatic dragon who gained immortality as a result. Now a cult is plotting to kill these five dragons, cut them open to retrieve the pieces of the devoured god's body, and return the god to life.
- **Dungeons of Dragons** In the earliest days of creation, fifteen dragons burrowed deep into the earth and went to sleep. Over the eons, elaborate underground dungeons have formed above and around them, becoming habitats for a wide variety of different monsters and repositories for vast treasures. Adventurers on this world are defined by their willingness to brave at least the upper levels of these dungeons, but no one has ever penetrated all the way to the depths where the sleeping dragons still lie.
- **Pillars of Creation** Five ancient metallic dragons (one of each kind) make their lairs in the Pillars of Creation. If all these dragons are killed, the world will literally collapse into chaos.
- **Stirrings of Rebirth** When the greatest spiritual leaders of the world reach the end of their lives, each is laid to rest on a funeral pyre and reborn out of the ashes as a dragon egg. Temples and monasteries across the world house collections of eggs representing all their past leaders, though most people doubt they will ever hatch. So what happens when cracks begin to appear in the oldest eggs?

# Lairs and Hoards
Dragons are deeply connected to the worlds in which they dwell. The magic of the Material Plane flows through them. It empowers their breath weapons and their tremendous might; it pools in their lairs and tangles in the treasures of their hoards. This chapter, intended for the Dungeon Master, explores the connection between dragons and the world they inhabit and how that connection manifests in each dragon's lair and hoard.

*"Dragon Lairs"* discusses how the magic that suffuses dragons spills out into the world around the locations these creatures call home. This section includes suggestions for the kinds of locales where dragons like to build their lairs, as well as additional regional effects that might manifest around a lair. Additional lair actions round out this section.

*"Dragon Hoards"* explores the relationship between the size of a dragon's hoard and the dragon's magical might. This section discusses dragons' practice of dividing their hoards into multiple caches that extend their magical reach, and the items that can link those caches together. It also explores the magical quirks—including hauntings and curses—that can arise as enormous amounts of magical power are pooled in one place.

*"What's in a Hoard?"* provides tables to determine the contents of a dragon's hoard, expanding on the treasure tables in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

![[033-04-001.chapter-splash.webp|right|300]](Fizban argues with a smug statue in the lair of an amused brass dragon)

## Dragon Lairs
*Home is where the hoard is.*— FizbanA lair is not merely a den where a dragon happens to sleep. It's a nexus for all the magical energy bound up in a dragon. A dragon's lair is a *home* and carries all the emotional and magical resonance of that word. It's a sanctum and the repository of the dragon's hoard. It's a place of power, with echoes of its own across multiple worlds.

Consciously or not, young dragons establishing lairs for the first time often seek to establish them in sites of magical resonance. A dragon might look for a place where multiple ley lines of flowing magical energy intersect, a site where a meteorite crashed to earth or a strange mystical crystal lies buried underground, or a place where long-forgotten wizards of an ancient magocratic empire saturated the land with their powerful spells. As a result, a dragon's lair is typically not the only unusual and magically powerful feature in its region. You can use the Lair Location table for inspiration when placing a dragon's lair in or near such a feature.

##### Lair Location
| d10 | Unusual Feature |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The area is a climate anomaly—a cool and lush oasis in a hot desert, a balmy spring within a frozen tundra, a drifting iceberg in a warm sea, a barren waste in the midst of a verdant forest, or the like. |
| 2 | The area is a wild magic zone. Whenever a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher or activates a magic item, roll a d10. On a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the *Player's Handbook*. |
| 3 | Natural rock formations align with celestial phenomena at particular times of the year. Stars and planets might line up with rock spires and windows on solstices and equinoxes, for example. |
| 4 | A dead god or titan is buried in the area. |
| 5 | The area is a vast crater, at the center of which is a long-buried meteorite. |
| 6 | A magical portal to another plane of existence releases dangerous energy—and sometimes creatures—into the area. |
| 7 | The area was a battlefield in an ancient war where thousands of soldiers were annihilated in a devastating magical assault. |
| 8 | Gravity does not function as expected in the area, which might manifest as giant floating earth motes or similar terrain. |
| 9 | An enormous tree—possibly the oldest living organism in the world—grows at the heart of the area. |
| 10 | A god left a profound impression on the site during an ancient visit to the Material Plane—perhaps a footprint, a pool of tears, or a splash of blood that has permanently infused the ground. |

### Regional Effects
*My favorite lair I've ever visited was a crystal dragon's. It turned everyone's voice into a high-pitched squeak. Remember, not all lair shenanigans are devastating!*— FizbanThe area around a legendary dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's presence. The regional effects described in the *Monster Manual* and *chapters 5* and *6* of this book are not the only ways a dragon's influence can manifest. You can add regional effects to make a particular dragon's lair feel unique and wondrous. Adding regional effects to a dragon's lair has no effect on the dragon's challenge rating, so you can use them freely to set the tone you want for your adventure.

#### Terrain Changes
Plant growth creates *difficult terrain*, sinkholes appear, and hedge mazes or icy walls limit movement. Additional regional effects in this category include the following examples:

**Exposing Terrain**. The terrain within 6 miles of the lair actively works to foil stealth, giving creatures other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Leaves change color to contrast with those trying to hide among them, branches move to reveal creatures, fog clears, and so on.

**Smooth Roads**. Difficult terrain within 12 miles of the dragon's lair is not considered difficult, as undergrowth moves out of a traveler's way, slopes are not as steep as they first appeared, and rough ground levels out under a traveler's feet.

**Wilderness Hazards**. Any of the *wilderness hazards* described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* might manifest near the dragon's lair.

#### Weather Changes
Fog, storms, precipitation, and supernatural mists can form around a dragon's lair, and some dragons can alter the weather to even greater effect as they see fit. Other weather-related regional effects include the following examples:

**Pleasant Weather**. The weather within 6 miles of the dragon's lair is always sunny and pleasantly warm during the day. Rain falls only at night, and dew waters the ground in the early morning.

**Unending Rain**. Rain falls constantly within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, ranging from light drizzle to a drenching downpour, and it *lightly* or *heavily obscures* the area.

#### Water Changes
A dragon's presence often affects nearby water, such as the way black and red dragons can foul the water near their lairs. Other regional effects related to water include the following examples:

**Beguiling Water**. When a creature drinks from a stream or lake within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + the dragon's proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the dragon for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.

**Icy Water**. All streams and bodies of water within 6 miles of the lair have a year-round covering of ice or are frozen solid, regardless of the local weather.

**Sweet Water**. Any water within 6 miles of the lair is supernaturally pure. It tastes mildly sweet, and if added to any other liquid, it changes an equal volume of that liquid into pure, drinkable water. This neutralizes poisons and turns salt water and contaminated water into fresh water.

#### Changes to Creatures
A dragon's presence can alter the behavior or physical characteristics of creatures dwelling near the dragon's lair. The presence of a gem dragon draws specific kinds of creatures to dwell nearby, and other dragons sometimes influence animals near their lairs to spy for them. Other creature-related regional effects include the following examples:

**Draconic Births**. Beasts and Monstrosities that are born within 6 miles of the lair have a high likelihood of being half-dragons.

**Draconic Tint**. Creatures that live within 6 miles of the lair develop coloration similar to the dragon's.

**Pervasive Influence**. People dwelling within 12 miles of the dragon's lair develop personality traits inspired by the dragon—heightened suspicion, garrulousness, greed, placidity, or the like. Individuals manifest these tendencies in different ways and to different degrees. If the dragon dies or leaves the area, these traits fade over 1d10 days.

#### Planar Connections
The powerful magic bound up in a dragon's lair can forge connections to other worlds of the Material Plane or even other planes of existence. Magic portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire often appear around a red dragon's lair, for example, and the lairs of crystal and topaz dragons are suffused with positive and negative energy, respectively. Other planar connections that might appear around a dragon's lair include the following effects:

**Draconic Blessing**. Bahamut or Tiamat has placed the lair under the effect of a *hallow* spell.

**Planar Portals**. Fissures, archways, or tunnels within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form magic portals to an appropriate Elemental Plane.

**Windows to Other Worlds**. Pools or passageways within the lair allow communication or travel between different worlds in the Material Plane. The dragon uses these to converse with echoes on other worlds.

#### Dragon Magic
Regional effects sometimes give dragons unusual magical capabilities. For example, gold dragons can appear in the dreams of creatures that sleep near their lairs, green dragons can't be tracked near their lairs, brass dragons are aware of creatures that come near water in their territory, and gem dragons can use *clairvoyance* to observe particular features near their lairs. Similar effects include the following examples:

**Death Warning**. The dragon is instantly aware of the death of any creature within 1 mile of its lair and can review the last moments of the creature's life as seen through the creature's eyes.

**Menacing Dreams**. People who sleep within 6 miles of the dragon's lair dream of the menacing dragon.

**Name Alerts**. If the dragon's name is spoken within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon instantly knows it and hears everything said within 10 feet of that spot for the next 5 minutes.

#### Cosmetic Alterations
Regional effects around a dragon's lair might involve only minor visual or auditory phenomena. This includes such effects as the appearance of a copper dragon's likeness on stone formations, the bright colors of underwater plants near a bronze dragon's lair, or the crystalline growths common near any gem dragon's lair. Other examples include the following effects:

**Deceptive Reflections**. At first glance, still water within 6 miles of the lair shows a reflection of the dragon flying overhead; the image disappears upon further examination.

**Face in the Clouds.** The dragon's visage appears in cloud formations above the lair, giving the impression that the dragon is watching intruders.

**Starry Scenes**. At night, the stars above the dragon's lair are surrounded by faint outlines of creatures that begin to move and act out scenes from the dragon's dreams—including the dragon.

### Lair Actions
Like regional effects, a dragon's lair actions reflect an intimate connection to the magical energy that flows through and around the lair. The broad scope of that magic means that a dragon need not be limited to the lair actions described in the *Monster Manual* and *chapter 6* of this book. *Chapter 5* of this book offers suggestions for additional lair actions for various kinds of dragon, which are tailored to those dragons and the example lair maps found in that chapter. Additional lair actions that might apply to any dragon in any lair include the following:

**Catch Breath**. The dragon rolls a d6. On a 6, it recharges its breath weapon action.

**Lair Rejuvenation**. The dragon regains hit points equal to the number of Hit Dice it has by drawing on the magical energy suffusing its lair.

**Lingering Breath**. Any creature that took damage from the dragon's breath weapon on the dragon's previous turn immediately takes 10 (3d6) damage of that type, as the breath weapon's energy lingers and clings to its targets.

**Toughened Scales**. Glowing magical energy swirls across the dragon's scales, granting the dragon resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until initiative count 20 on the next round.

> ##### Age and a Dragon's Lair
>Ordinarily, a dragon gains access to lair actions and manifests regional effects around a lair only upon reaching adulthood and the legendary status that comes with that age. The close connections between a dragon and the fabric of the Material Plane take time to develop, so the dragon's power doesn't manifest in the world until the dragon has spent nearly a century in a lair. That said, if you want to give lair actions and regional effects to a young dragon or even a wyrmling, you can.
>
>Regional effects have no bearing on a dragon's challenge rating—they exist primarily to help you craft the proper atmosphere around a dragon's lair. So feel free to have a younger dragon manifest these effects, albeit perhaps in a smaller area than what's described in the *Monster Manual* or this book and using lower DCs for any associated ability checks or saving throws.
>
>Lair actions can have a more significant effect on a younger dragon's challenge rating. For adult or ancient dragons, who already benefit from legendary actions, lair actions don't significantly impact their power or how they function in play, but if you add lair actions to a dragon who doesn't already have legendary actions, those actions significantly change the way the dragon plays and probably adjust their challenge rating upward by 1 or more. Use the guidelines on *creating monsters* in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to determine whether you're making the dragon too much of a threat to a party.

## Dragon Hoards
*What is a dragon without a hoard? The answer, it turns out, is "significantly diminished."*— FizbanHoarding treasure is an essential part of draconic nature. It's not that dragons are overwhelmingly greedy, as other peoples understand the term—though some dragons definitely are. Nor are they simply attracted to shiny objects in the manner of magpies. Rather, hoards are extensions of dragons' inherently magical nature—resonators that focus their magic and link them to the magic of the Material Plane.

### Age, Hoards, and Power
Dragons thrum with the magical energy that suffuses the Material Plane, and this energy is amplified by their possession of material things. In practical terms, this means dragons' power is related to both age and the size of their hoards in ways that clever dragons—and would-be dragonslayers—can exploit.

#### Wyrmlings
Wyrmling dragons begin acquiring hoards as soon as they can fly, but their small scope of operations makes them unlikely to amass more than a few hundred gold pieces worth of treasure and perhaps a handful of magic items. If sharing a lair with other wyrmlings or adult dragons, the wyrmlings stash their hoards in their own distinct portions of the lair. Otherwise, they keep their treasure in secret caches near where they sleep.

#### Young Dragons
As dragons transition from wyrmling to young age, at around five years, they also begin to look for their first permanent lairs and amass more substantial hoards, which grow in value to many thousands of gold pieces. Young dragons keep their hoards safe in the same central location where they sleep. Such dragons typically do not yet impose regional effects, but these effects might begin to manifest as the dragons' connections to their lairs develop. You can add regional effects and even lair actions to young dragons, particularly for dragons who have acquired an unusually large hoard. These dragons might not be old enough to fully step into the power of an adult, but gathering such a hoard makes them more powerful than other dragons of a similar age.

![[034-04-002.an-ancient-dragons-hoard.webp|right|300]](An ancient dragon's hoard can hold enough wealth to cause the rise and the ruin of dynasties)

#### Adult Dragons
A dragon's transition to adulthood is measured by two milestones: a century of life and a hoard worth around 15,000 gp or more. A hoard of that size binds dragon, lair, and territory together in a tangle of magical energy that makes the dragon truly legendary, empowering the dragon's legendary actions and lair actions and spreading draconic influence throughout the area as regional effects.

As dragons age and amass larger hoards, they tend to establish multiple lairs. This serves partly to mitigate risk—there's less chance of a dragon losing an entire hoard in a single burglary if that hoard is spread across multiple locations—and partly to extend the dragon's magical influence across a growing territory. The treasure cache stored in each lair anchors the dragon's power there even when the dragon isn't present, extending the reach of regional effects.

Dragons typically establish new caches as their hoard reaches multiples of 15,000 gp. Throughout their adult years, dragons can each assemble six to eight caches in multiple lairs spread across the greater part of a continent.

#### Ancient Dragons
Around the age of eight hundred years, dragons take on ancient status, by which time they have typically amassed eight to ten caches whose total value is at least 200,000 gp. Ancient dragons continue expanding their hoards as the centuries wear on, increasing both the number of caches and the value of each cache, until their total wealth can exceed a million gold pieces.

### Linking Hoards
A dragon dividing a hoard often apportions one or more pieces from a linked set of objects to each treasure cache. This practice strengthens the mystical link among the portions of the divided hoard, helping to maintain the dragon's claim of ownership over the parts of the hoard far from the dragon's current location and unifying scattered caches into what is effectively a single hoard.

This linking can add the fun goal of having the characters collect a complete set of divided treasure as they try to find all the caches of a dragon's hoard. The Hoard Linking Items table offers suggestions for item sets that a dragon might use in this way. Ideally, players should be able to deduce the total number of items in the set after they've found one or two caches, so they know how many more pieces need to be collected. Sometimes the correct number is obvious (the number of pieces in a chess set or cards in a deck, for example), but consider having an item found early on be stored in a decorative box whose empty spaces indicate the number of pieces missing.

##### Hoard Linking Items
| d10 | Linking Items |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The broken pieces of an artifact (such as the Rod of Seven Parts) |
| 2 | A set of large gemstones, each engraved with the seal of a particular nation or the symbol of a deity |
| 3 | Numbered volumes of an encyclopedia or comprehensive history |
| 4 | Statuettes depicting different kinds of dragons |
| 5 | Portraits of the members of a well-known historical family |
| 6 | Ornate nesting dolls that feature a large gemstone egg at the heart of the set |
| 7 | Regalia—an orb, a crown, a scepter, and so forth—belonging to a recently deposed monarch |
| 8 | Pieces of a full suit of armor that once belonged to an ancient hero |
| 9 | A set of teeth from a rival dragon, a prophet, or a rare creature |
| 10 | Pieces of a chess set or another board game, or cards from a deck of playing cards, a tarokka deck, or a *deck of many things* |

### Plundering a Hoard
Because dragons' power is linked to treasure, it's possible to weaken a dragon by plundering the dragon's lair. By gaining access to a hoard and making off with a significant portion of that wealth, characters can diminish the dragon's connection to both that lair and its associated territory.

As a rule of thumb, if a dragon's lair no longer holds at least 10,000 gp worth of treasure, the site is no longer considered a lair. The dragon can't use lair actions there, and the regional effects surrounding the lair end or fade as if the dragon had died.

This suggests an effective strategy that characters might hit on for confronting a dragon: find one of the dragon's smaller lairs and plunder the treasure there, removing it quickly. Disturbing a hoard inevitably attracts the dragon's attention, because either minions or the dragon's magical connection to the hoard alerts the dragon to intruders. A dragon coming to investigate the disturbed lair has a strong incentive to fight in reaction to the theft—and to prevent the loss of more treasure. The realization might come too late that the loss of treasure has left the dragon vulnerable.

Theoretically, it's possible to strip an adult or ancient dragon of legendary status by plundering the dragon's entire hoard across all its locations. For this to work, the dragon would have to be magically bound or otherwise prevented from interfering with the looting—but that sort of binding might be easier than killing a powerful legendary dragon.

### Hoard Quirks
A dragon's hoard has features similar to those of a powerful magic object, and plundering a hoard can have lingering effects long after the death of its draconic owner. Any number of supernatural effects can linger in and around the hoard of a legendary dragon, often concentrated in a few valuable pieces of treasure—the most precious gems or art objects, or the rarest magic items, for example.

#### Regional Effects
The regional effects associated with legendary dragons' lairs are channeled into the environment from the dragons through their hoards. These effects can linger to varying degrees when a hoard's treasure is moved somewhere else, as in any of the following examples:

**Alter Water**. An item from the hoard pollutes or purifies any water it touches.

**Alter Weather**. An item from the hoard attracts weather appropriate to the dragon's kind.

**Attract Animals**. Tiny animals are irresistibly attracted to an item from the hoard and constantly try to take it.

**Dragon Dreams**. Creatures sleeping near the treasure dream of the dragon.

**Personality Shift**. Characters wielding items from the hoard develop personality traits evocative of the dragon's traits.

**Seek Return**. Sentient items from the hoard want to return to the dragon's lair and cause characters to accidentally stray in that direction.

**Verdant Influence**. If coins from the hoard are placed in soil, they encourage lush plant growth.

#### Haunted Hoards
It's not unusual for one or more items in a dragon's hoard to be haunted. Restless spirits might haunt objects that held special significance to them in life, and the death of the dragon who stole those items might be an opportunity for such spirits to find rest at last. A haunting spirit might fully manifest as a **ghost**, a **specter**, a **wraith**, or a similar creature, or it might give the haunted item the characteristics of a sentient magic item.

The most certain way to end a haunting is to complete the unfinished business that keeps a spirit bound to the mortal world. In the case of a haunted hoard, you can use the Unfinished Business table to help you decide what that might be.

##### Unfinished Business
| d6 | Unfinished Business |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Entrust the haunted item to the ghost's heir |
| 2 | Entomb the haunted item with the ghost's corpse |
| 3 | Destroy the haunted item |
| 4 | Use the haunted item for a specific purpose |
| 5 | Reunite the haunted item with other items forming a set |
| 6 | Destroy the ghost's killer: a dragon who is an echo of the hoard's owner on another world |

#### A Dragon's Curse
A dragon's violent death sometimes causes a hoard to carry a lingering curse. A dying dragon might pronounce a bitter magical oath upon any who would plunder the dragon's hoard, or a living dragon might inscribe a dire warning about the foul magic that will be unleashed on any who plunder the dragon's treasure. Such a curse typically affects not only those who steal from the hoard, but anyone else who comes into contact with the treasure. Moreover, breaking the curse is usually possible only if all the treasure is gathered together again in one place.

Use the Hoard Curse Effects table to inspire possible effects for a dragon's lingering curse.

##### Hoard Curse Effects
| d6 | Hoard Curse Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Each affected creature gains 1 level of exhaustion that can't be removed until the curse is broken. |
| 2 | Each affected creature automatically fails saving throws against dragons' breath weapons and Frightful Presence. |
| 3 | Each affected creature gains vulnerability to the damage type of the breath weapon of the dragon who cursed the hoard. |
| 4 | Each affected creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet. |
| 5 | Affected creatures can't spend Hit Dice to regain hit points during a short rest. |
| 6 | When an affected creature dies, its soul becomes imprisoned by the slain dragon's spirit, preventing the creature from being raised from the dead. |

In general, ending the curse on a dragon's hoard is not as simple as casting a single spell. Magic can offer temporary respite, though. A *remove curse* spell cast on any affected character suppresses the effect of the curse for 1 hour, while a *greater restoration* spell suppresses the curse until the victim finishes a long rest.

Returning the entire hoard to the dragon's lair ends the curse, but removing even a single coin activates it again. Short of the drastic step of abandoning the treasure, gathering the entire hoard together and performing some specific rite can end the curse. Such a rite might involve any or all of the elements suggested on the Breaking a Hoard Curse table.

##### Breaking a Hoard Curse
| d4 | Rite Elements |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Cast the *hallow* spell |
| 2 | Make an offering of blood from everyone who participated in killing the dragon (or those creatures' nearest kin) |
| 3 | Bathe or sprinkle the treasure in the dragon's blood |
| 4 | Make a sacrifice to Bahamut, Tiamat, or both |

One other way to bypass a dragon's curse on a hoard is to have the treasure become part of another dragon's hoard, whereupon the previous owner's curse is nullified. Clever adventurers might work out a bargain with a friendlier dragon involving a trade of cursed treasure in exchange for a similar (but probably smaller) amount of treasure freely given.

### Competition for a Hoard
Shadowy cults, reclusive scholars, rival adventurers, and mysterious organizations might seek out a dragon's hoard, either trying to claim it from a dragon or trying to acquire it from characters who have slain a dragon. Aside from greed, such groups can have any number of motivations for seeking a dragon's treasure. Often, such groups seek to draw on the magic of a dragon's hoard to perform some great ritual. The Hoard Magic table suggests some possibilities.

##### Hoard Magic
| d6 | Magical Motivation |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Create a permanent protective ward covering a city-state or small kingdom |
| 2 | Destroy a large magical ward protecting a region |
| 3 | Create a dead magic zone where spells and magic items won't function |
| 4 | Repair the fabric of magic in a dead magic zone |
| 5 | Reassert the dominance of the Material Plane in a region, banishing influence that has been seeping in from another plane of existence |
| 6 | Open a portal to another plane of existence or another world of the Material Plane |

![[035-04-003.skilled-burglar.webp|right|300]](While a dragon slumbers, a skilled burglar might be able to make off with a treasure or two, but looting the entire hoard is another matter)

## What's in a Hoard?
*Great piles of coins are all well and good, but the best treasures are the ones with memories attached. Let me tell you about my collection of pie plates!*— FizbanThe random treasure tables in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* can help you quickly generate a hoard for a dragon of any age. (As suggested in that book, you should roll on the hoard tables at least twice for legendary dragons.) If you want a more detailed hoard, the information under "*Creating a Hoard*" can help you generate treasure with more variety, which is especially appropriate for significant troves. The average monetary value of a hoard created using these guidelines is about the same as if you rolled twice on the tables in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

### Kinds of Treasure
Use these guidelines in conjunction with the information in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to detail the treasures in a dragon's hoard. Feel free to swap coins, gems, and art objects in a dragon's hoard for different such items of equivalent value. Perhaps a sapphire dragon takes great pride in a hoard full of raw sapphires and jewelry featuring sapphires, or a copper dragon might love sleeping on a vast bed of copper coins!

#### Coins
The coins in a dragon's hoard might come from all over the world and across uncountable ages of history. To add flavor to the potentially enormous pile of coins in a dragon's lair, you can use the Coin Origins table to determine the origin of any particular group of coins.

##### Coin Origins
| d10 | Origin |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Equivalent value in *trade goods* (see the *Player's Handbook*) rather than coins |
| 2–3 | Coins from an ancient culture local to this region, ancestral to the people who live here now |
| 4–5 | Coins from an ancient culture in a distant region |
| 6–7 | Coins from a nearby contemporary culture |
| 8–9 | Coins from a local contemporary culture |
| 10 | Coins from another world |

You might decide that all the coins in a dragon's hoard have the same origin, but it's more likely (particularly in the hoard of an older dragon) that the coins have a variety of origins. If you aren't interested in explaining the details of coinage from a variety of contemporary and historical cultures in your game's setting, it's enough to tell your players that some of the coins are unfamiliar in their size, shape, or inscription—but their value is unchanged.

#### Mundane Items
A dragon's hoard often includes mundane items that can be clues to their owner's personality and history, and that might inspire further investigation by curious adventurers. The *Hoard Mundane Items* table in the "*Creating a Hoard*" section provides a quick starting point for generating these items. You can find more inspiration on the *Trinkets* table in the *Player's Handbook* and the tables in the "*Dungeon Dressing*" section of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

#### Gems and Art Objects
The *Hoard Gems* table and the *Hoard Art Objects* table under "Creating a Hoard" let you randomly determine the value of each individual gem and art object in a hoard. Use the tables in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* to help you describe these treasures. *Chapter 5* of this book also includes tables you can use to generate distinctive art objects for a particular dragon's hoard.

#### Magic Items
You can determine the specific magic items found in a dragon's hoard in one of two ways. The *Dungeon Master's Guide* provides a full set of *random magic item* tables, labeled A through I. Each entry on the Hoard Magic Items table under "Creating a Hoard" includes a parenthetical reference to one of those tables in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, so you can randomly roll an item from those tables. Alternatively, you can use the rarity and category (minor or major) shown on the *Hoard Magic Items* table to pick an item of your choice from the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, *chapter 2* of this book, or any other source.

As described in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*, the items found on Magic Item Table A through Magic Item Table E in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* are minor items, a category that includes common items, potions and scrolls (which can be used only once), and other items whose impact on the game is minor or utilitarian. The items on Magic Item Table F through Magic Item Table I are major items: permanent items that can have significant long-term impact on the game.

## Using the Entries
For each dragon's entry in this chapter, you'll find information about crafting personalities, inspiration for building adventures, details about lairs, and ideas about the kinds of treasures that dragon favors. Scattered throughout are maps of dragon lairs you can plunder for your adventures.

### Creating a Dragon
Use the tables in this section in conjunction with "*Roleplaying Dragons*" in *chapter 3* to craft distinctive dragon characters. Most of the personality traits and ideals align with the general nature of the dragons, but the tables also include examples of atypical dragons.

For dragons who do not have spellcasting ability, this section also includes suggested spells to give a dragon if you want it to be a spellcaster. A table shows the spells a typical dragon knows, along with the spell save DC for those spells. The dragon can cast each listed spell once per day, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.

### Dragon Adventures
Building on "*Dragon Adventures*" in *chapter 3*, this section starts with a collection of adventure hooks that might bring characters into contact with a dragon of a particular kind, whether in conflict or as an ally or patron. Then, additional tables explore the relationships each kind of dragon has to other creatures of a similar challenge rating in their preferred environment. Use these tables to inspire adventures that feature dragons dwelling alongside other creatures, either as enemies or as allies.

### Dragon Lairs
This section expands on "*Dragon Lairs*" in *chapter 4*. If there is a map of a sample lair for a dragon of that kind, it is accompanied by discussion of the lair's important features. Many of these sections also describe additional lair actions a dragon can use to exploit the lair's features, as well as additional regional effects that might alter the landscape surrounding the lair.

You can adjust the scale on the lair maps to suit the needs of the dragon lairing there. If you use these maps for a wyrmling's lair, you might set the scale to 5 feet per square, but for an ancient dragon or a greatwyrm, you might need to go as high as 20 feet per square to give the dragon room to move.

### Dragon Treasures
Each entry ends with a discussion of the kinds of treasures the dragon favors, including a table of art objects you can use to expand on the information in "*What's in a Hoard?*" in *chapter 4*. The items shown on these tables can represent art objects of any value, depending on their materials, quality, and history. For example, a small bronze bust might be worth 25 gp, while a large bust crafted from platinum and emeralds could be worth 7,500 gp.

### Dragons of Legend
Sidebars throughout this chapter highlight famous dragons of different kinds. Many of these legendary dragons are almost godlike in stature, known and respected on multiple worlds across the Material Plane.

## Amethyst Dragons
*I once sought life advice from an amethyst dragon who specialized in that sort of thing. I told her all my flaws and unwanted behaviors, and she prescribed the best elixir: "Stop doing those things!" I still think back on that visit in trying times.*— FizbanUse the tables, map, and other information in this section to craft unique encounters with amethyst dragons. Amethyst dragon stat blocks appear in *chapter 6*.

### Creating an Amethyst Dragon
Use the Amethyst Dragon Personality Traits and Amethyst Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive amethyst dragon characters.

##### Amethyst Dragon Personality Traits
| d8 | Trait |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | I am never so content as when contemplating the beauty and wonders of the multiverse. |
| 2 | I am a sworn protector against the depredations of the Far Realm, and I will root out its corruption wherever it may arise. |
| 3 | What use is vast knowledge or insight if it is not shared with those who can appreciate it? |
| 4 | Although some are fascinated by words, I think numbers are the true foundations of creation. |
| 5 | To experience a thing is to truly understand it. Direct and personal experience is the most valuable form of knowledge. |
| 6 | I see a far more kaleidoscopic reality than you do... or than any of your selves do, really. |
| 7 | It is not my place to interfere. I merely seek to observe, learn, and understand. |
| 8 | With a true understanding of metaphysics, anything is possible—including the creation of a more orderly and perfect cosmos than this one. |

##### Amethyst Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Balance. Everything is a complex interaction of forces that must be kept in a delicate and carefully maintained balance. (Neutral) |
| 2 | Knowledge. We are the whole of creation, seeking to understand itself. (Any) |
| 3 | Self-Improvement. I am a complex gem, and I constantly polish and refine my many facets to make the whole that much more perfect. (Any) |
| 4 | Responsibility. Having knowledge and power gives one a responsibility to those who have less of either. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Noble Obligation. My superior experience, intellect, and insight give me a duty to mediate disputes when I can. (Good) |
| 6 | Power. Knowledge is power, power must be used, and I use it. Your concerns are irrelevant. (Evil) |

### Amethyst Dragon Adventures
The Amethyst Dragon Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for stories and adventures involving amethyst dragons.

##### Amethyst Dragon Adventure Hooks
| d8 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An amethyst dragon seeks a rare type of crystal found in the domain of a territorial stone giant clan. |
| 2 | A coven of hags seeks to reclaim its hag eye, which rests within an amethyst dragon's hoard. |
| 3 | An amethyst dragon magically disables all teleportation within a thousand miles of their lair. Governments within that area seek emissaries who can negotiate an end to the restriction. |
| 4 | An amethyst dragon recruits a group of adventurers to psychically trade bodies with adventurers from another world, so that each can carry out certain tasks before swapping back. |
| 5 | A cult devoted to a Great Old One of the Far Realm seeks an alien monolith that can summon its master, but the site is guarded by an amethyst dragon. |

| 7 | An amethyst dragon seeks the means to plant special crystals that will allow the dragon to magically coexist in multiple places at once across the world during a rare celestial alignment. |
| 8 | An amethyst dragon is fusing with their echoes on other worlds. They all hope to ascend to godhood, perhaps recreating or replacing Sardior. |

#### Connected Creatures
Amethyst dragons are generally aloof creatures, dwelling in isolation for long periods of time and rarely cultivating connections with other creatures. When they do connect with others, it is most often for intellectual and philosophical pursuits or to fulfill some arcane purpose involving the dragons' echoes across the worlds.

##### Amethyst Dragon Wyrmling Connections
| d6 | Connected Creatures |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An **amethyst dragon wyrmling** is in the care of a cloistered religious order of scribes. |
| 2 | A half-amethyst dragon cares for an **amethyst dragon wyrmling** sibling after the disappearance of their dragon parent. |

| 5 | A cloister of **flumphs** protects an **amethyst dragon wyrmling** while feeding on the wyrmling's excess psionic energy. |
| 6 | A circle of druids looks after an **amethyst dragon wyrmling** lairing in the circle's mountain tarn. |

##### Young Amethyst Dragon Connections
| d6 | Connected Creatures |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A myconid community dwells in tunnels near a **young amethyst dragon's** lair, and its members telepathically commune with the dragon and any visitors in the lair from time to time. |
| 2 | A **young amethyst dragon** and a **githzerai zerth** travel together, learning about the multiverse. |
| 3 | A **young amethyst dragon** wants to take over the cavern lair of a **hydra**. |
| 4 | A deep pool in a **young amethyst dragon's** lair leads to the underground domain of an **aboleth** the dragon has been seeking to eliminate. |
| 5 | A **young amethyst dragon** and a **cloud giant** regularly host each other to play strategy games. |
| 6 | **Pegasi** nesting in the mountain heights are under the protection of a **young amethyst dragon**. |

##### Adult Amethyst Dragon Connections
| d8 | Connected Creatures |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Merfolk** dwelling near an **adult amethyst dragon's** lair are under threat from **sahuagin** raiders. |
| 2 | Clusters of **shriekers** serve as a warning system in the tunnels of an **adult amethyst dragon's** lair. |
| 3 | The Enlightened Dragon Master of an isolated monastery is, in fact, an **adult amethyst dragon**. |
| 4 | An **adult amethyst dragon** is at war with a **beholder** that has moved into the dragon's domain. |

| 8 | The crystal-infused clay near an **adult amethyst dragon's** lair is ideal for the creation of **clay golems**, and the dragon can perceive everything those golems do. |

##### Ancient Amethyst Dragon Connections
| d4 | Connected Creatures |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A yuan-ti cult known as the Serpents of the Dreaming City draws power from an **ancient amethyst dragon**, which the cultists keep in eternal slumber with braziers of enchanted smoke. |
| 2 | A rogue **purple worm** swallowed a large portion of an amethyst dragon's hoard before burrowing back into the deep Underdark. The dragon has a magic crystal that can trace the worm's movement. |
| 3 | An **ancient amethyst dragon** is able to awaken psionic potential in others, and many of the greatest psi warriors in history were the dragon's students. |
| 4 | After centuries guarding the world against incursions from the Far Realm, an **ancient amethyst dragon** has been corrupted by aberrant influences and now leads a cult the dragon once opposed. |

> ##### Eldenser the Lurker
>Contradictory tales told throughout the Forgotten Realms are unclear about whether or not the ancient amethyst dragon Eldenser still lives, largely because of the behavior that earned him the epithets "the Lurker" and "the Worm Who Hides in Blades." Obsessed with observing the world and its creatures, Eldenser developed magic that allows his mind to inhabit the blade of a weapon after his death. He exists now as a **draconic shard** (described in *chapter 6*).
>
>Eldenser prefers the role of silent observer to doing anything that might give away his presence. In this fashion, he has inhabited countless weapons over long years, including many belonging to famous adventurers whose exploits the dragon has seen firsthand.
>

### Amethyst Dragon Lairs
Amethyst dragons prefer lairs near water, ideally mountain lakes, where they take advantage of existing caves and tunnels. A lair behind a cascading waterfall is ideal, and often part of that lair is submerged, allowing the dragon to rest in the water and cultivate the fish that are their preferred food.

Amethyst dragon lairs frequently exhibit or develop large and beautiful clusters of amethyst crystals, including massive cathedral geodes split open to show their contents and clusters of crystal points more than a foot in diameter that extend six to ten feet from the interior stone surfaces of the lair. These crystals resonate with the dragon's presence, and glow with a soft inner light. The older the dragon, the deeper the purple color of the crystals.

![[041-map-5.1-amethyst-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Amethyst Dragon Lair Features
The amethyst dragon lair shown in map 5.1 is set beneath a mountain ridge between two deep tarns, with streams flowing down toward the lowlands. The lair has the following features:

- **Entrances** Two cave entrances provide access to the lair, one in the rock face just above one tarn and one below the surface of the other tarn. The dragon uses the underwater passage as a secret entrance and emergency exit.
- **Main Caves** The lair is a complex of caves and tunnels; the stone surfaces are smooth and water-worn, and the air is cool and slightly damp.
- **Glowing Crystals** Large clusters of glowing amethyst crystals grow out from the walls and ceiling, casting dim light in a 30-foot radius.
- **Chimneys** Two chimneys connect the main caves to the three chambers above. Each chimney appears to continue up through the ceiling of the upper level and down through the floor of the lower level, but the dragon's magic warps space within the lair. Moving up past the upper level brings a creature to the lower level again, while moving down from the lower level brings a creature to the upper level. A creature or object dropped down one of the chimneys continues falling endlessly unless it or some outside force has the means to slow or stop it. This property of the lair vanishes after 1d10 days if the dragon dies.
- **Upper Caves** The dragon most often sleeps in the largest upper chamber of the lair. The dragon's hoard is divided between that area and the chamber at the opposite end of the upper level. The magic of the lair sometimes makes it appear as though the dragon were sleeping amid both caches, creating the impression that two dragons dwell here.

### Amethyst Dragon Treasures
Amethyst dragons often collect crystals and gems, particularly their namesake stones, in raw, polished, or cut forms. They have less interest in coins and precious metals, although many have a fascination with metal items that have a silvery finish.

Amethyst dragons favor treasures with particular scholarly or philosophical value as a part of their hoard, including fine books, scrolls, or carved tablets; tapestries or woven "tomes" of embroidered cloth; complex scientific instruments; and religious icons or objects. They are fond of unique and unusual art objects, especially those connected to far-off or long-lost cultures, other planes of existence, or other worlds—and of magic items that allow movement between those planes or worlds. The odd spatial nature of an amethyst dragon's lair can sometimes cause items to transpose between one dragon's hoard and the hoards of the dragon's echoes, allowing for treasures with a surprising range of origins.

##### Amethyst Dragon Art Objects
| d8 | Object |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A complex orrery of the planes of existence made of engraved movable plates of precious metals and set with gemstones |
| 2 | A two-foot-long rod of pale crystal that gives off eerie sounds when touched, with the tone varying up and down the length of the rod |
| 3 | A life-sized human skull carved from a single piece of crystal, including a hollow interior |
| 4 | A beautifully engraved gong, 3 feet in diameter, suspended from an ornate, inlaid frame |
| 5 | A crystal singing bowl etched with mantras in Gith, accompanied by an inlaid wooden mallet |
| 6 | A beautifully illuminated treatise on the planes of existence, bound in ebony covers with metal corner caps and a cover boss set with polished gems |
| 7 | An etched crystal that projects a star map showing an unfamiliar star field and constellations when set on top of a light source |
| 8 | A ring in the shape of a coiling dragon, with tiny gemstones for eyes |

## Black Dragons
*Tiamat spent the most time crafting her black dragon. I was flabbergasted at her final product and suggested oh so many adjustments, but at some point, a project is simply due.*— FizbanUse the tables, map, and other information in this section to craft unique encounters with black dragons.

### Creating a Black Dragon
Use the Black Dragon Personality Traits and Black Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive black dragon characters, and use the Black Dragon Spellcasting table to help select spells for a spellcasting dragon.

##### Black Dragon Personality Traits
| d8 | Trait |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | I demonstrate my brilliance through the cruel subtlety of my actions. |
| 2 | Watching the works of lesser beings crumble and fall into ruin fills me with joy. |
| 3 | I never confront a threat directly when deceit and skulduggery are available options. |
| 4 | Subjugating others is preferable to destroying them. Thralls make life so much more pleasant. |
| 5 | I will go to great lengths to obtain deadly new magical knowledge. |
| 6 | Nothing lasts forever. But I promise to outlast you. |
| 7 | I have witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations. What consideration does a creature as pitiful and short-lived as you deserve? |
| 8 | Collecting antiquities and learning why lost cultures vanished are my reasons for existing. If you can help me in that, I'll let you live. |

##### Black Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Envy. If the achievements of others cannot be eclipsed, they can always be torn down. (Evil) |
| 2 | Acquisitiveness. Possessing what others covet is immensely satisfying. (Any) |
| 3 | Cunning. Destroying your foes without exposing yourself to danger is an art. (Evil) |
| 4 | Adaptability. It is not the most powerful, but the most flexible who survive. (Chaotic) |
| 5 | Patience. There's no need to rush a poorly constructed plan when time is on your side. (Any) |
| 6 | Serenity. Observing a culture sliding into oblivion along the trek of time puts life in perspective. (Any) |

##### Black Dragon Spellcasting
| Age | Spell Save DC | Spells Known |
|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Young** | 13 | *blindness/deafness*, *create or destroy water* |
| **Adult** | 16 | *blindness/deafness*, *create or destroy water*, *plant growth* |
| **Ancient** | 19 | *blindness/deafness*, *create or destroy water*, *insect plague*, *plant growth* |

### Black Dragon Adventures
The Black Dragon Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for stories and adventures involving black dragons.

##### Black Dragon Adventure Hooks
| d8 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A black dragon recently took control of a band of pirates and their backwater hideout. Emboldened, the pirates have started raiding nearby shipping lanes. |
| 2 | A conflict-averse black dragon is secretly spraying an alchemical defoliant on local farmland to push people living in the area away from the dragon's lair. The resulting famine is devastating the countryside. |
| 3 | Rival realms are secretly being driven to war by the machinations of a black dragon, who hopes to revel in the resulting carnage. |

Mindless Undead, shambling mounds, carnivorous flora, Oozes, and Constructs make appealing servants, especially working in concert with a black dragon's fiendishly clever traps. A black dragon's intelligent followers tend to worship draconic majesty and typically include kobolds, troglodytes, lizard folk, and (more rarely) yuan-ti.

##### Black Dragon Wyrmling Connections

| 3 | Ruins rumored to hold the treasury of a lost empire are guarded by an elaborate network of ooze-based traps designed by a restless **adult black dragon**. |
| 4 | The appearance of a **spirit naga** in the domain of an **adult black dragon** encourages the dragon to study necromancy. |
| 5 | An **adult black dragon** has hidden a cache of gems in a dismal topiary maze filled with **shambling mounds**, traps, and noxious plant life, all for the amusement of testing adventurers. |
| 6 | An **adult black dragon** has bound **water elementals** to the task of bringing food to the dragon's lair. |

| 8 | Two nations—one led by an **adult black dragon** and the other by a **yuan-ti abomination**—are on the brink of joining forces to destroy a third nation. The threatened nation is recruiting adventurers to defend it. |

##### Ancient Black Dragon Connections
| d4 | Connected Creatures |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | An **ancient black dragon**, after studying blasphemous texts dedicated to alien gods, issues a warning that a corrupted **planetar** will soon fall to earth like a meteor in the fens outside a great city's walls. |

| 3 | The decades-long machinations of an **ancient black dragon** and an evil **archmage** are nearing fruition. If their pact succeeds, they will unleash devastation on a continental scale. |
| 4 | An **ancient black dragon** rules a vast, decadent city built on artificial islands within a polluted lake. The site is threatened with destruction by an enraged **archdruid**—but destroying the city means thousands of innocents will die. |

### Black Dragon Lairs
Black dragons prefer to lair in swamps and jungles—the more dismal and fetid, the better. Within those environs, they favor ruins for their defensibility and dreary aesthetic.

When choosing their lairs, black dragons are fond of locations that are naturally constraining and confounding. Whether adventurers seeking the dragon must wind their way through the roots of an ancient mangrove swamp or brave a trap-filled boggy ruin, the experience promises to be a deadly affair.

The black dragon lair shown in map 5.2 is a derelict chapel, lost to time in a gloomy fen. The building's wooden framing rotted away long ago, leaving a looming skeleton of lichen-covered stone and a lone tower. The lair has the following features:

- **Swampy Lake** Abutting the chapel is a swampy lake where the dragon sleeps. The foul water stinks of dead fish and rot, while the dense foliage and scraggly trees along the shoreline writhe with scuttling, slithering fauna. A thick blanket of fog—part of the dragon's corrupting influence—adds a claustrophobic feel to the lair.
- **Chapel Floor** Columns of clammy stone jut like ribs from the chapel's exposed floor, as if in mockery of the sanctity of this once-holy place.
- **Underground** Twin staircases in the main hall descend to a partially flooded crypt. Five trapped stone sarcophagi rise above the waterline, their lids depicting armored warriors whose faces have been scoured away by acid. Each sarcophagus holds a few coins and shiny baubles mixed with junk that appears to be treasure at first glance. In the tower basement, a fully submerged tunnel leads to the lake where the dragon sleeps.
- **Chapel Tower** A swollen oak door, flanked by worn carvings of noble warriors, opens into the dank stone tower, which stands empty except for a chipped staircase that climbs to a second floor and then ends in midair before reaching the crumbling third level. Mold-covered friezes of knights kneeling before angelic beings line the stairwell.
- **Tower Top** The dragon's true hoard is kept safely at the top of the crumbling tower, where the dragon enjoys perching and staring out into the gloom. Intruders who can't fly must scale the sheer, slimy walls of the tower (either from outside or from the interior of the second floor), braving whatever traps might be in store if they hope to claim the dragon's real treasures.

> ##### Rhashaak
>Guardian of the cursed city of Haka'torvhak, the **black greatwyrm** Rhashaak lives deep in the jungles of Q'barra on the world of Eberron, where he is worshiped as the incarnation of a god by numerous kobolds, dragonborn, and lizardfolk. Rhashaak has existed for millennia as the primary guardian of the imprisoned Fiend Masvirik, who once held dominion over reptilian creatures.
>
>Over time, Rhashaak has been tainted by the corruption he guards and has slowly succumbed to its evil. Powerful wards keep Rhashaak bound to his fallen city, but his legions would pose a significant threat if Rhashaak were ever roused by settlers or explorers searching his ruins.
>

#### Additional Lair Actions
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) black dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Filth Burst** The dragon chooses a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of it. A 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder of watery filth centered on that point erupts from the ground until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cylinder is *difficult terrain*.
- **Grasping Muck** Tendrils of roiling muck extend from the dragon's lair to grasp up to three creatures of the dragon's choice that it can see within the lair. A targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round.
- **Noxious Gas** A bubble of swamp gas erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within its lair. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Regional Effects
Any of these effects might appear in the area around a black dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Ennui** Creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair are filled with listless despair.
- **Grating Spies** Trilling, obnoxious birds, bugs, and reptiles follow any Humanoid creatures unknown to the dragon within 6 miles of the lair, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The dragon can suppress this effect at will.
- **Rotting Domain** Stinging bugs are aggressive and the air is heavy with the odor of rot within 6 miles of the lair.

### Black Dragon Treasures
Black dragons appreciate objects of cultural, magical, or scientific significance that originated from lost cultures. Knowing a relic they possess is coveted by others because it presents a link to a lost past is what gives that relic its value. Black dragons also love conventional treasures such as gems (particularly opals), precious metals that don't corrode easily, and stone sculptures.

Because their lairs are inevitably slimy and dank, if not outright flooded, black dragons rarely have cloth, wood, or paper items unless such items are stored in watertight containers. Black dragons versed in magic often record notes and rituals on bones, shells, and metal plates instead of paper or parchment. These unusual works are art in their own right, each featuring rows of graceful Draconic script etched with the dragon's own acid.

Most black dragons keep their treasure well hidden and have a private viewing room for particularly prized possessions. Knowing that interloping inferiors were able to so much as see their hoard can drive a black dragon to a state of rage.

##### Blue Dragon Personality Traits
| d8 | Trait |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | I enforce order and social hierarchies because I believe this is how strong societies are built. |
| 2 | Why waste time and energy murdering weaker creatures when I can make them entertain me instead? |
| 3 | My children, whether born to me or chosen by me, are treasures. |

| 8 | I am sometimes secretly impressed by what other peoples can accomplish with the proper guidance. |

##### Blue Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Order. Life is best when everyone is part of a hierarchy and rules are clear and consistent. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Humor. Lesser beings exist to be my playthings, and I excel at finding ways to toy with them. (Evil) |
| 3 | Taste. I value my possessions for more than just their beauty and consider gauche displays of wealth a sign of inferiority. (Any) |
| 4 | Family. Blood ties are irrevocable, and even if one doesn't particularly like one's family members, they come before anyone else. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Display. One should never take risks or waste resources by using power if one can achieve the same results merely by the threat of power. (Any) |
| 6 | Loyalty. I don't form bonds with those outside my kindred often. But when I do, I am an unshakable and powerful ally. (Good) |

##### Blue Dragon Adventure Hooks

| 2 | Enraged at the loss of a wyrmling, a blue dragon is causing lightning storms to destroy coastal settlements and refuses to stop until someone delivers the adventurer responsible. |
| 3 | A prosperous-looking city appears among the desert dunes, drawing explorers and treasure hunters aplenty, but it's an illusion created by a blue dragon. |
| 4 | A blue dragon promises great wealth to anyone who offers worthy treasures—but eats anyone who misses the mark. |
| 5 | A blue dragon recently acquired trunks full of dress clothes and costumes and is abducting people to put on a fashion show. |

#### Connected Creatures
In contrast to most chromatic dragons, blue dragons see value in relationships with other creatures, even if the power balance in those relationships is always weighted in the dragon's favor. Though territorial, they are willing to allow creatures they consider their servants to live peacefully within their domains. Blue dragons are also more family oriented than many other dragons, and it's not unusual to find a multigenerational extended family of blue dragons sharing a territory. Other creatures need to tread carefully in such a place, for any injury or insult to one of the dragons is considered a strike against the whole family.

### Blue Dragon Lairs
Blue dragons make their lairs in deserts and other arid landscapes. They prefer warm climates, but if an otherwise ideal potential lair presents itself in a cold environment, they find ways to adapt. Instead of seeking out lofty domiciles, blue dragons build their lairs underground, burrowing beneath sand or using magic to hew rock into an intricate warren of rooms and tunnels that can be expanded to accommodate a growing family. Still, they appreciate the tactical advantages of height and usually create their lairs near a spire or cliff from which they can keep watch over their territory.

Though most blue dragons would be loath to the use the term themselves, their lairs are often surprisingly homey. They favor lairs that balance beauty and comfort and adorn them in soothing shades of blue, purple, and green.

![[047-map-5.3-blue-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Blue Dragon Lair Features
The blue dragon lair shown in map 5.3 is built in the ruins of an ancient city swallowed by desert sands. Some of the lair's chambers still contain the remnants of temples and other structures. The traces of this metropolis suggest that it was of significant size, but very little of it remains accessible in the area of the lair, since the dragon has collapsed the lair on intruders multiple times, rebuilding in a nearby portion of the ruins each time.

The walls of the lair are crystallized glass formed by the dragon's lightning breath. Most of its floors are loosely packed sand, with patches of rough stone showing through in some areas. The dragon has constructed a system of mirrors to bring in sunlight from chambers open to the sky, a system that not only brightly lights the interior but also heats the sand to a comfortable basking temperature.

The lair has the following features:

- **Entrance Chamber** An open central cavern is the lair's primary entrance. The glass walls rise 30 feet to the surface and are fused with carved stone pillars and partial walls from the ancient city. A narrow, jagged piece of granite juts out horizontally from the wall near the top of the chamber, providing a perch from which the dragon can survey the cavern. The sand covering the floor of the chamber sometimes ripples or swirls ominously, perhaps in response to unpredictable desert winds, the dragon's magic, or some creature lurking beneath the sand.
- **Hoard Display** Just off the entrance chamber (toward the left side of the map), a smaller cavern with a worked stone floor contains the dragon's artfully arranged hoard. The glass walls of this chamber are studded with blue gems, and narrow light wells let in sunlight that bathes the room in dappled blue light. The ancient stone tiles on the floor contain lightning-charged traps to blast intruders.
- **Dragon's Den** The dragon sleeps in a large chamber in the bottom right of the map. The den is a well-preserved remnant of the ancient city; this gracious, elegant space is hung with silk curtains in shades of blue and purple, and its worked-stone floor is covered with plush, patterned rugs in complementary hues. It features a bejeweled and cushioned dais on which the dragon often reclines.
- **Private Entrance** Just above and to the right of the den is a small chamber open to the sky that the dragon uses as a private entrance to the lair. A secret door prevents unwitting creatures from wandering directly into the den.
- **Treasury** At the left end of the den, a door set under a blue-tiled arch leads to a smaller room where the dragon keeps relics that are too precious for the main hoard or that don't match the hoard's overall aesthetic.

#### Additional Lair Actions
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) blue dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Misleading Mirage** Until initiative count 20 on the next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.
- **Sudden Sinkhole** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius, 20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. On a successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the pit.

#### Regional Effects
Any of these effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Blue Luster** Creatures that spend a year within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find blue objects fascinating and feel compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.
- **Mirage Terrain** The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.
- **Sandstorm** A sandstorm blows constantly within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.

> ##### Iymrith
>Known as the Dragon of the Statues and the Doom of the Desert, the ancient blue dragon **Iymrith** commands an army of **gargoyles** and has studied magic for centuries in the hope of transcending her physical form and becoming a god.
>
>Iymrith often appears as a **storm giant** using her special Change Shape trait. In this guise, she infiltrates storm giant settlements and insinuates herself into the affections of the rulers' heirs, becoming a mentor to them—and turning them against their parents. She demands great accomplishments from her own offspring, but she is more than willing to support and aid them with her considerable resources.
>
>Ferocious in her youth, Iymrith has grown more philosophical and even whimsical as she ages, but she has not lost sight of her quest for transcendence.
>

### Blue Dragon Treasures
Blue dragons have strict standards for what treasures they allow into their hoards and reject valuable objects that don't meet those standards. One blue dragon might keep only treasure that coordinates visually with the other items in the hoard, while another might focus on artwork from a particular period or seek out jewelry made for rulers in a certain region. Blue dragons' hoards are an enormous source of pride, and these dragons are insulted by offerings that don't meet their standards.

Blue dragons favor blue, purple, and green gemstones; art depicting oases and fountains; and fine textiles in cool colors. They also love scents that evoke storms and rain, and magic items that produce weather effects.

##### Blue Dragon Art Objects

| 6 | An ornately tooled tome recording the lineages of all the blue dragon families in the area |
| 7 | A massive geode that contains spectacular blue, purple, and black crystals |
| 8 | A blue silk fan painted with ground gems that creates a briny breeze when hung from the ceiling |

### Brass Dragon Lairs
Brass dragons prefer to make their lairs in hot, dry, rocky areas—desert canyons, caves beneath arid mesas, or ancient stone ruins. Brass dragons often compete with blue dragons for lair sites, but are more likely to make a lair among rocks than to burrow under the sands.

Brass dragons like their lairs to be spacious and well lit; many lairs feature windows or skylights to let sunlight in. They respect skillfully wrought stonework and often take over canyon fortresses and similar structures when they're abandoned by their original non-dragon builders. Brass dragons are also capable of fine stonework themselves, and many meticulously carve out grand halls and galleries in which to store and display their hoards.

![[049-map-5.4-brass-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Brass Dragon Lair Features
The brass dragon lair shown in map 5.4 is an ancient ruin located within rough, stony canyons in a desert environment. The lair has the following features:

- **Column Guardians** Massive columns carved to resemble warriors watch over the main entrance to the canyons; the dragon has given them whimsical names and ascribed unique personalities to them.
- **Grand Hall** At the deepest part of the canyon, a wide archway admits visitors to the grand hall that serves as the main lair. Regal statues stand bathed in sunlight admitted by huge shafts in the ceiling—wide enough for the dragon to climb up but not fly through. A much larger shaft above the rear chamber allows the dragon to fly directly in and out of the lair.
- **Hoard Chamber** The bulk of the dragon's hoard is stored in a partially collapsed chamber most easily accessed by way of a shaft in the ceiling. (A narrow gap in the fallen stones filling an old passageway might allow a Small or nimble character to squeeze in or out that way.) Eight heavy pillars surround a well in the floor and support the ceiling around the shaft.

> ##### Aasterinian
>Like many greatwyrm dragons, Aasterinian is sometimes seen as a god. In fact, she is a cheeky and quick-witted brass dragon who often serves as a messenger for Bahamut. Her heightened dragonsight allows her to transmit messages easily between worlds, so all her incarnations know nearly everything any other one is aware of.
>
>Aasterinian encourages all dragons to think for themselves rather than relying on the ideas or opinions of others. She cherishes learning and invention and often takes on Humanoid guise to offer patronage to mortal scholars and artificers.
>

- **Unused Chamber** A smaller chamber shown on the left side of the map is not currently used by the dragon, but it shows signs of having been recently used by visitors—either creatures welcomed by the dragon or ones that escaped the dragon's notice.
- **Wells** Four wells—three in the canyons leading to the main hall and one inside the hoard chamber—provide fresh water for the dragon and any guests, and they also serve as a sort of alarm system. As described in the *Monster Manual*, whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 feet of one of these wells, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence.

#### Additional Lair Actions
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) brass dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Animate Statues** The dragon chooses up to three statues in the lair that it can see. Each of these statues briefly animates and attacks one creature within 5 feet of it, with a +7 bonus to hit and dealing 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit.
- **Blast of Wind** A mighty wind sweeps through the lair in a direction of the dragon's choice, blowing along a line 40 feet wide and 100 feet long. Each creature in that area except the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the wind's direction and be knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished. If the dragon is within the area of the wind, it can choose to be pushed 15 feet in the wind's direction, and the wind can't knock the dragon prone.
- **Obscuring Sand** Dust and sand fill the air within 120 feet of the dragon, making the area *lightly obscured* until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Regional Effects
Any of these effects might appear in the area around a brass dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Cloud Companion** A small, wispy cloud follows non-evil creatures as they journey within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. It changes direction as the creatures do, remaining interposed between them and the direct glare of the sun, and grants them advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of *extreme heat* (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide*).
- **Talkative Denizens** Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find pleasure in hearing the sound of their own voices. The air is filled with a deafening chorus of birds and small animals, and sapient creatures talk extensively.

### Brass Dragon Treasures
Brass dragons prefer yellow, orange, and brown gemstones that coordinate with their own scales, and they favor precious art objects fashioned from brass, including items such as pitchers, braziers, and bells. They also cherish organic treasures, from finely crafted wood to textiles.

Brass dragons often invest items in their hoards with imagined personality. A wyrmling might have a favorite marble bust or onyx cameo to converse with, while an ancient dragon might have lively dialogues with an entire gallery of paintings, statues, and tapestries. A brass dragon who divides a hoard into separate caches often imagines those caches as individuals (or even groups of people) with independent personalities, and the dragon might spend time in different lairs to socialize with different "friends."

##### Brass Dragon Art Objects
| d10 | Object |
|:---:|---|

| 7 | A large tapestry depicting a party of elves riding stags through the woods; the dragon has named all the stags and offers condolences on their being saddled and mounted |
| 8 | A sculpted bird in an ornate cage; the dragon calls the bird Fweep and sings to it |
| 9 | A large mirror in a frame studded with gemstones; the dragon likes to gaze in the mirror and imagine having a mate |
| 10 | An idol of an obscure minor divinity; the dragon addresses it reverently as "O mighty Froglet" (its shape is only vaguely frog-like) |

### Creating a Bronze Dragon
*Bronze dragons are the absolute worst at transforming themselves into human form. They always embellish with extra hair in all sorts of places. I applaud ingenuity, but in this matter, simpler is better!*— FizbanUse the Bronze Dragon Personality Traits and Bronze Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive bronze dragon characters, and use the Bronze Dragon Spellcasting table to help select spells for a spellcasting dragon.

##### Bronze Dragon Personality Traits
| d8 | Trait |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The weakest creatures sometimes display the greatest courage. I respect all beings who risk their lives in defense of something greater than themselves. |
| 2 | My payment is a matter of principle. Requiring even a small fee for my service allows those I help to preserve their dignity. It's really for your benefit. |
| 3 | I have no time for chitchat or insinuation. I get to the point and expect others to do the same. |
| 4 | I respect law and order, but it's no excuse for tyranny. Those who abuse power must be stripped of it, and soldiers have a responsibility to refuse immoral orders. |
| 5 | I strive to treat foes honorably, but not at the expense of strategy. A quick death in combat is its own kind of courtesy. |
| 6 | I trust my gut. I'd rather act on incomplete information than be hamstrung by indecision. |
| 7 | I'm fascinated by other species' military technology, especially magic armaments and siege engines—the bigger, the better! |
| 8 | Conflict drives evolution. By sparking wars between nations, I contribute to the advancement of their civilizations. (And they pay me for it, too!) |

##### Bronze Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Action. Passivity is shameful. We owe it to the world and ourselves to try to improve things, even if we can't guarantee success. (Any) |
| 2 | Analysis. When possible, dig into the root of a conflict before committing to end it, to ensure you aren't fighting for the wrong side. (Any) |
| 3 | Honor. I never lie outright, though I choose my words carefully. I will fight to the death rather than break my word or abandon a comrade. (Lawful) |
| 4 | Discipline. Disorganization breeds defeat. I demand self-control from both myself and those who fight beside me. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Guardianship. It's the duty of the strong to protect the weak. (Good) |
| 6 | Dominance. Anyone who opposes my will is either an underling to be punished or an enemy to be vanquished. (Evil) |

### Bronze Dragon Lairs
Bronze dragons typically dwell along rocky and inaccessible coastlines. Some make dry homes atop lonely sea stacks, while others favor completely submerged lairs in sunken ruins. Many seek out strongholds straddling land and sea, with both dry and flooded chambers.

When it comes to lairs, bronze dragons value function over form, and they study potential sites with a military commander's eye for defense. They appreciate the solidity of cliff-side caves or stone fortresses, often reinforcing existing defenses with clever traps and bulwarks. At the same time, bronze dragons understand that they are their own best defense in a siege, so they are careful to maximize their mobility with multiple ways in and out of their lairs.

#### Bronze Dragon Lair Features
The bronze dragon lair shown on map 5.5 is a set of sea caves that once served as a dwarven military outpost. The lair has the following features:

- **Sentinel Statue** In a hidden cove sheltered from the sea, a statue of a dour elf queen watches over a small beach. The statue's eyes are magically warded to alert the dragon of intruders.
- **Campaign Chamber** Beyond the beach stands a pillared dwarven hall whose walls have begun to crumble near the entrances. Here the dragon grants audiences and presides over councils of war, surrounded by trophies chosen to remind viewers of the dragon's heroic history.
- **Lofty Alcove** Up a steep set of stairs at the bottom right of the map lies a dry chamber that serves as barracks for guests and a library for documents too fragile to survive in damp conditions.
- **Island Larder** Another elevated chamber carved into the cliffs of a small island abutting the beach (in the center right of the map) serves as a larder in case of a siege. It also houses a clever series of mirrors arranged throughout the stone to allow the dragon to observe the seascape unnoticed.
- **Watery Caves** Two chambers near the top of the map are accessible only via submerged tunnels, their entrances disguised with thick seaweed and boulders. The larger cavern on the right is the dragon's sleeping chamber, while the smaller on the left holds most of the dragon's hoard.

![[051-map-5.5-bronze-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Additional Lair Actions
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) bronze dragon can use one or more of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Ocean's Call** The dragon conjures a swarm of spectral dolphins. Each creature in the water within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) slashing damage; then the swarm vanishes.
- **Salt Burst** The dragon chooses a point it can see in the lair. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point bursts with abrasive salt crystals. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) slashing damage.
- **Whelming Water** The dragon causes a strong current to course through the water in its lair. The dragon chooses any number of creatures it can see that are standing or swimming in water within 120 feet of it. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

#### Regional Effects
Any of these effects might appear in the area around a bronze dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Phantom Escort** Ghostly naval ships from an ancient armada appear, escorting well-meaning creatures in need of the dragon's help toward the dragon's lair.
- **Underwater Pursuit** Sailors glimpse the shadowy, illusory form of a dragon in the depths below them, keeping pace with their vessel.
- **Unfailing Faithfulness** Sapient creatures that spend a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair find it nearly impossible to break a promise.

> ##### Fireflash
>Also known as Khirsah, Fireflash is a gregarious and inquisitive bronze dragon with a keen interest in other species, especially dwarves and elves. During the War of the Lance, he was one of the first to answer the call of Silvara—the elf identity of the silver dragon D'argent—for the metallic dragons to join the conflict. During the Vingaard Campaign, Fireflash teamed up with a dwarf named Flint Fireforge and a kender named Tasslehoff Burrfoot to capture Highmaster Bakaris. Later, in the Blue Lady's War, Tasslehoff foresaw Fireflash's demise at the hands of the death knight Lord Soth—and was thus able to avert the dragon's grim fate.
>
>After the wars, Fireflash faded from public view, but rumor holds that he continues his lifelong fight against evil, using his legendary skill in aerial combat to assist the Knights of Solamnia.
>

### Bronze Dragon Treasures
A bronze dragon's hoard is a history of the dragon's deeds, with trophies from fallen foes and payment from grateful petitioners resting alongside more mundane spoils of war and loot salvaged from shipwrecks and the seabed. Though these dragons rarely steal outright, a several-ton bronze dragon landing near—or even on—a merchant ship asking to trade often obtains extremely one-sided bargains from unnerved sailors.

Bronze dragons have a romantic view of their role as guardians of justice and prefer treasures that tie into their heroic narrative. Their hoards teem with weapons, armor, and magic items built for the battlefield—the more unique, the better. Stories matter to a bronze dragon, who would rather have the humble spear that felled a tyrant than a jeweled blade that's never seen combat. They love collecting and studying histories that can give them tactical insight or inspiration, as well as safeguarding artifacts they deem too dangerous to entrust to anyone else.

Then the adventurer Ranressa Shiard was shipwrecked on the isles.

### Copper Dragon Lairs
Copper dragons prefer dry uplands, hilltops, or mountainous foothills, where they build their lairs in caves, crags, or tunnels. Although sometimes natural, the passages and caverns of a copper dragon's lair might be carved out or expanded by the dragon's powerful acid breath.

Copper dragon burrows are often sinuous and winding, featuring twists, turns, and dead ends. Blank walls in the lair can conceal cunning hidden passages or might be stone or clay thin enough for the dragon to burst through them. The narrowest tunnels in a copper dragon's lair are just barely wide enough to accommodate the dragon's body, and they typically loop around and reconnect with themselves so the dragon can double back without having to reverse direction.

![[053-map-5.6-copper-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Copper Dragon Lair Features
The copper dragon lair shown in map 5.6 is a network of tunnels and large chambers dug beneath dry, rocky hills. The dragon's acid breath has left the surface of the stone here with a smooth, melted appearance.

The lair has the following features:

- **Concealed Entrances** Four sloping tunnels emerge onto the surface among the hills, concealed by brush and tumbled stone. These openings allow the dragon to enter and depart the lair via multiple routes. Additionally, the sunken areas shown on the surface map correspond to areas where the dragon can burst through the ceiling to reach the surface.
- **Secret Doors** Concealed passages connect a number of the tunnels and chambers of the lair. Their secret doors are magical in nature, with the stone at a passage junction reshaping itself at the dragon's command to open a passage or close it again (similar to the effect of a *stone shape* spell). Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 10 feet of one of these secret doors, the dragon becomes aware of that creature's presence and location. Each secret door radiates an aura of transmutation magic but is otherwise indistinguishable from solid stone.
- **Hoard Chamber** At the bottom of the underground map, a chamber hidden beyond two secret passages and carved out beneath a low hill contains the bulk of the dragon's hoard. The dragon often sleeps in the adjoining chamber, acting as a final line of defense against intruders.

#### Additional Lair Actions
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) copper dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Laughing Gas** The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A cloud of pink gas fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area that fails a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw is incapacitated with laughter until the end of its next turn.
- **Torpid Energy** The dragon chooses a creature it can see within 120 feet of it. If the target fails a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, its speed is halved, and it can't use reactions or bonus actions until the end of its next turn.

#### Regional Effects
Either of these effects might appear in the area around a copper dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Distant Melodies** The ethereal music of woodwinds and bells can be heard carried on the wind within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.
- **Starlit Stones** Standing stones are common on hilltops within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The stones shed dim light in a 10-foot radius at night. (If the dragon dies, the stones remain, but they no longer shed light.)

### Copper Dragon Treasures
Copper dragons love burnished metals, particularly those with red and yellow tones, along with gleaming gemstones of all kinds and colors. They also like fine art objects, ranging from tapestries and woven rugs to paintings, sculptures, and ornate carvings.

Copper dragons also collect trophies and keepsakes of their best tricks and triumphs. These range from the crowns, armor, and weapons of long-dead foes to portraits, personal items, and oddities such as a single ancient coin or an arcane clockwork.

### Crystal Dragon Lairs
Crystal dragons seek out frigid, picturesque locations with clear views of the sky above to build their lairs. Then, like gem cutters seeking the perfect diamond, they spend much of their lives refining, polishing, and enhancing the beauty of their lairs.

Crystal dragons' lairs are often found in polar expanses, dizzying mountain peaks, and glacial floes. Some resemble icy palaces, with numerous balconies offering plentiful opportunities for sky gazing. Though ice and snow are the most common materials they use in the construction of a lair, crystal and other precious minerals feature prominently in certain areas. In this way, crystal dragons' hoards literally become the fabric of their homes.

![[055-map-5.7-crystal-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Crystal Dragon Lair Features
The crystal dragon lair shown in map 5.7 is the home of a dragon who has spent considerable time shaping the pinnacle of the tallest mountain in a local range, transforming it into a series of gleaming spires. Though visitors are rare, the dragon has built a roadway that ascends the mountain to encourage travel to and from the lair.

The lair has the following features:

- **Ice Bridge** The crowning glory of this infrastructural marvel is a wide bridge of ice that spans a chasm between a lesser peak and the lair.
- **Anterior Spires** Rising from the far side of the bridge are the lair's anterior spires. These solid, pointed shafts resemble inverted icicles more than towers and enclose a terraced, open-air amphitheater that serves the dragon as a parlor.
- **Ice Sculptures** In each of the areas enclosed by the anterior spires and the grand spires, four ice sculptures (shown as circled stars on the map) depict dragons of different kinds.
- **Promenade** A dragon-sized promenade winds upward from the anterior spires to the summit of the mountain.
- **Grand Spires** Like the anterior spires, the grand spires enclose a multi-tiered sanctuary of ice and snow. Trusted guests might be invited into this part of the lair.
- **Central Spire** The central grand spire is hollow, and built into its upper recesses are several icy perches where the dragon keeps the greatest treasures. As with everything in the lair, nothing is truly off-limits to visitors, as long as they show themselves to be peaceful and respectful (or very, very interesting). The most favored of the crystal dragon's acquaintances might even be gifted with a short trip to the very pinnacle of the central spire—the highest point in the local landscape—to take in the breathtaking view.

### Crystal Dragon Treasures
Crystal dragons covet bright, opulent objects; baubles and trinkets that remind them of the stars, sky, sun, or heavens; and relics that aid in the divinatory arts. They prioritize beauty over value, so while they adore gemstones of all kinds, they prize fine quartz as highly as cut diamonds.

Crystal dragons enhance the natural beauty of their lairs with the treasures they collect, always trying to display those items they consider most precious in a tasteful and interesting way and recounting their elaborate histories to visitors whenever possible. Indeed, crystal dragons also see amassing such wonderful hoards as a way to attract new friends to the remote locations they inhabit.

| 1 | I will not risk injury at the hands of weaker creatures—especially while I can turn them against one another and have them fight in my stead. |
| 2 | It is difficult for anyone not of dragonkind to penetrate the twisting labyrinth of my thoughts. |
| 3 | I might disagree with other dragons, but we are superior beings and should not lower ourselves to direct conflict. |
| 4 | I have no interest in going to the surface world. It's where one sends one's servants. |
| 5 | While the petty squabbles of other creatures bore and irritate me, I might hear out those who demonstrate an appreciation for the finer things in life by bringing me delicacies like clams or **aboleth** flesh. |
| 6 | I might be willing to exert myself to take out a **mind flayer**. Those disgusting creatures must be stopped. |
| 7 | I dream of seeing the deepest places in the ocean. |

##### Deep Dragon Ideals

### Deep Dragon Lairs
Deep dragons make their lairs in the recesses of the Underdark, often near the settlements of people with whom they have alliances or enmities. Their lairs are highly individual. Some are woven from networks of living fungus. Others are built upon the ruins of ancient cities or carved into caves near underground lakes.

Deep dragons' lairs serve as bases for the dragons' explorations, as well as providing safe storage for their hoards. When these curious creatures are away from home searching out new environments and seeing new vistas, they usually leave their lairs protected by servitors, allies, magic, traps, or some combination of these protections.

#### Deep Dragon Lair Features
A deep dragon lair might share the same basic structure as the sapphire dragon lair shown on *map 5.12*, but instead of being formed from stone, it might consist of chambers hollowed out within a fungus network growing near an underground river. Whatever the setup, a deep dragon festoons the narrow, twisting passages between the lair's fungal walls with magical and mundane traps. A typical lair has the following features:

- **Connecting Passages** Because a deep dragon lacks a sapphire dragon's ability to shape stone, add a few connecting passages or secret doors to otherwise inaccessible chambers, possibly including connections to the adjacent underground stream as entrances to the lair.
- **Reception Hall** The dragon uses one of the large chambers in the lair as a reception hall for allies and servitors. Like the rest of the lair, this chamber is lit by phosphorescent fungal blooms that give off soft green, blue, and purple light.
- **Hoard Chamber** The dragon's hoard is hidden away in a more remote chamber, draped in illusion spells and protected by traps and magical alarms. When triggered, those alarms summon the dragon's minions and allies first, followed by the dragon.
- **Underground River** Where an underground river runs along the outside edge of the lair, the dragon has slowed its flow with a rocky dam, creating a small pool in which to bathe and raise aquatic delicacies.
- **Guest Suite** A large chamber with connected smaller chambers, such as that seen toward the bottom of the map, forms a suite used as guest lodgings for visiting dragons. Though any treasures with significant financial or sentimental value to the host dragon are stored away in the protected hoard, these tastefully appointed visitors' chambers contain lesser treasures from inaccessible or storied locales, chosen to pique visitors' curiosity and provide an excuse for the host to tell these items' tales.

### Deep Dragon Treasures
Deep dragons adore goods from distant lands, especially if those goods are unique. They hoard mementos of memorable hunts or exploring expeditions. They love gemstones in deep, dark colors, as well as those with an iridescent sheen, and they favor keeping their treasures in frames and on stands made of precious woods and set with even more gems.

It is rare to find a deep dragon hoard that is simply a pile of gems and treasures, for these creatures take great pride in organizing and displaying their possessions. They can easily spend multiple days guiding visitors from prize to prize, telling stories about favorite keepsakes—and when deep dragons visit each other, these tours can stretch out for days.

##### Deep Dragon Art Objects

Dragon turtles are stolid and slow to anger. This temperament, combined with their disinterest in moral quandaries, allows them to get along with—or at least abide—most creatures they encounter. They frequently enter symbiotic relationships with other sea creatures that can bring them food or treasure, and they sometimes agree to work for creatures who ply them with generous sums of wealth.

### Dragon Turtle Lairs
Dragon turtles make their lairs in underwater caves and coral reefs. Most such lairs are situated deep beneath the waves near the ocean's floor, though some dragon turtles prefer coastal lairs with easier access to settlements they can trade with—or prey upon. Particularly reclusive dragon turtles seek lairs in even more remote locales, including deep-sea trenches or underwater volcanoes.

Dragon turtles are largely unconcerned with the design of their lairs and seldom work to improve them. A dragon turtle's primary concern when selecting a lair is ensuring that the site is large enough to accommodate the creature's prodigious size as the centuries wear on. After that, proximity to shipping lanes and freedom from irksome neighbors take precedence.

#### Dragon Turtle Lair Features
The underwater caves inhabited by dragon turtles are structurally similar to the seaside caverns where bronze and topaz dragons lair. When constructing a dragon turtle's lair, you can simply take a coastal map and translate it to an underwater environment or use the map as-is if the dragon turtle is content to lair near the surface.

As an example, *map 5.14* depicts a topaz dragon's lair in a seaside cavern, but it could be reimagined as a grotto in the side of a coral reef rising from a shelf on the ocean floor, with the following features:

- **Shelf Floor** The sandy beaches represent the ocean floor at a depth of 100 feet, which is coated in a soft layer of fine sediment. The water around the lair is clear but dimly lit. The water's edge on the map represents the lip of the shelf, which descends to a dark plain twelve hundred feet below.
- **Coral Reef** The rocky cliff side depicts the contours of a coral reef that rises 80 feet above the shelf. The exterior face of the reef is covered with stinging corals.
- **Reef Hollow** The dragon turtle's lair lies in a hollow in the reef's interior that was bored out by a giant sea worm the dragon turtle killed. The original entrance at the level of the shelf floor ascends through a weed-choked tube that opens into the main chamber. Here, the dragon turtle nests in a recessed shelf along the back wall, where the creature can gaze down at the hoard scattered across the chamber floor. Although the lair is mostly flooded with seawater, a layer of breathable air is trapped in the top 3 feet of the main chamber.
- **Coral Shelf** A secondary entrance grants access to a coral shelf 40 feet above the shelf floor and illuminates the lair for a few hours each day with a shaft of dim sunlight.

#### Lair Actions
As they are presented in the *Monster Manual*, dragon turtles don't have access to lair actions while in their lairs. At your discretion, you can give an **adult** or **ancient dragon turtle** access to lair actions, increasing its challenge rating by 1. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon turtle can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon turtle can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Blasting Current** A strong water current moves through the dragon turtle's lair. Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon turtle must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be moved 30 feet in a direction of the dragon turtle's choice. On a success, the creature is moved 10 feet instead.
- **Entangling Kelp** Strands of spectral kelp reach out to ensnare creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the lair that the dragon turtle can see. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of its next turn.
- **Steam Eruption** Steam erupts in a 15-foot cone from a point on the ground the dragon turtle can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant creatures resistance to this damage.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a dragon turtle's lair can be transformed by its presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Diverting Currents** Underwater currents push unwanted visitors away from the lair. While swimming in these currents, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in *difficult terrain*), even if a creature has a swimming speed.
- **Elemental Portals** Crevasses on the ocean floor within 1 mile of the dragon turtle's lair form two-way portals to the Elemental Plane of Water, allowing creatures of elemental water into the world to dwell nearby.
- **Hot Water** Geothermal vents heat the water within 6 miles of the dragon turtle's lair to 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

If the dragon turtle dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

> ##### Aremag
>Aremag is an **adult dragon turtle** who lays claim to the southern reaches of the Sea of Swords in Faerûn, extracting tribute from all who enter or leave the Bay of Chult. Traders often carry chests of treasure on board expressly for this purpose—pirates are more likely to offer captives, launched out in a skiff to feed the dragon turtle's voracious appetite.
>
>Aremag's predation has occasionally provoked reprisal from Chult's inhabitants, as attested to by his milky-white left eye and missing patch of shell. However, rather than humbling the great dragon turtle, these injuries have made him more irascible. Those who meet the dragon turtle are advised to pay whatever price he asks, and to treat him with the deference he believes he deserves.
>

### Dragon Turtle Treasures
Dragon turtle hoards frequently contain quantities of coral and pearls received as tribute from aquatic peoples, as well as chests full of coins, gems, and trade bars looted from shipwrecks. However, a dragon turtle's most prized possessions are treasures from the surface realm. Such objects are likely to be fashioned of metal or stone, as wood, cloth, and paper keep poorly in a dragon turtle's watery lair.

More so than for most dragons, a dragon turtle's hoard is likely to contain a motley assortment of treasures from disparate locales. Although many dragon turtles simply lump the elements of their hoard together into a nest, more inquisitive individuals take an interest in specific treasures, sometimes seeking out surface-world folk to inquire about an object's function or provenance.

> ##### Raulothim
>Raulothim is an **ancient emerald dragon** who dwells in an extinct volcano known as the Pit of Stars, on the northernmost isle of Ruathym off the Sword Coast of Faerûn. Though most emerald dragons are paranoid by nature, Raulothim became especially so after having witnessed the arrival of planar travelers in Faerûn. Fearing that an invasion of his world by interplanar armies was inevitable, he has spent the past century collecting magic items that he hopes will enable him to survive the coming conflict.
>
>Raulothim's drive to amass magic and his innate mistrust of anyone powerful enough to potentially threaten him make the dragon a dangerous adversary. However, he knows the surest way of safeguarding Faerûn against planar invaders is to keep a careful watch on all planar portals—and that to do so, he must rely on allies. Raulothim is therefore open to negotiating with adventurers willing to aid in that task—but only those he is sure he can trust. On more than one occasion, doubt has gnawed at Raulothim's mind, prompting him to preemptively strike against a previously trusted ally.
>

### Emerald Dragon Lairs
Emerald dragons make their lairs in caves and subterranean ruins, favoring locations that have been abandoned—and ideally forgotten—by other creatures. They are most comfortable in extreme heat, so they frequently choose lair sites in the sides of volcanoes or near geothermal vents.

An emerald dragon's lair is a maze of twisting tunnels, interconnected caverns, or crumbling ruins designed to disorient intruders. Circuitous routes within the lair provide the dragon with numerous ways to evade pursuit, while strategically designed choke points allow them to harry enemies with repeated ambushes. Emerald dragons frequently lay traps and alarms at the entrance points to their lairs, with older (and more paranoid) dragons employing several layers of such defenses.

![[066-map-5.8-emerald-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Emerald Dragon Lair Features
The emerald dragon lair shown in map 5.8 is a series of ancient vaults situated beneath a city built in the caldera of a dormant volcano. The vaults fell into disuse over a century ago when an upwelling from the lake at the caldera's center collapsed a portion of the vaults and flooded their halls with boiling water and noxious fumes. The stairwell leading up to the city was sealed to prevent the fumes from spilling into the streets above. Decades later, once the volcano's activity had subsided, the dragon moved in.

The lair has the following features:

- **Lava Tubes** When the volcano is quiet, the dragon uses the lava tubes to come and go from the lair.
- **Great Hall** The emerald dragon resides in a grand rectangular hall near the center of the vaults, keeping one eye on the hallway leading to the flooded stairwell, never quite trusting that some covetous intruder won't find a way through.
- **Treasury** The dragon stores the finest treasures in a smaller chamber just above the great hall on the map.
- **Watery Caves** Near the bottom portion of the map, the vaults give way to natural stone caves; these caves slope down to a subterranean pool that connects to the caldera lake via an underwater channel. When the volcano is active, the waters here bubble up into the caves before draining down nearby lava tubes. During especially active periods, the waters surge up into the nearest halls and corridors before draining away.
- **Underwater Cache** The dragon stashes gold and gems in an underwater cave (at the bottom of the map), the entrance to which lies 40 feet below the surface of the subterranean pool.
- **Hatchery** The dragon has lovingly arranged the three small chambers in the top left of the map, farthest from the pools, as a hatchery. Visitors might discover an egg or an **emerald dragon wyrmling** in one of the chambers.
- **Preserved Vaults** The dragon has left most of the remaining areas of the vaults as they were when their creators abandoned them, taking great interest in the artifacts and architecture they left behind. Visitors who manage to convince the dragon they are not a threat are treated to a tour of the vaults, with the dragon acting like the curator of a museum.

### Emerald Dragon Treasures
Emerald dragons are unusual among gem dragons in their preference for coinage over gemstones when amassing treasure. They are fascinated by the various designs of coinage and often strive to collect rare mintages. Most emerald dragons can precisely enumerate the names, amounts, and denominations of every bit of currency in their hoards.

Emerald dragons also prize cultural artifacts, especially relics with historical significance. They place great importance on an item's provenance, which can make it difficult to gauge how they might value any particular object. Despite remaining unmoved by the loss of a gold scepter deemed to be a replica, an emerald dragon might become enraged at the theft of a clay mug known to have been used by a legendary dwarf warlord while on campaign.

### Creating a Faerie Dragon
Use the Faerie Dragon Personality Traits and Faerie Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive faerie dragon characters.

##### Faerie Dragon Personality Traits

|:---:|---|
| 1 | Some people say I have a short attention span, and that I'm easily distractable, but they don't... oh wow, is that a lute? |
| 2 | I do not constantly steal food. If you can't keep track of your rations, that's really a personal failing. |
| 3 | I'm much smarter than I look, and if you can't say the same, this is going to be a short conversation. |
| 4 | Elf, dwarf, horse—you non-dragons all look the same to me. No offense. |
| 5 | When I narrate what I'm doing in song, it makes everything feel more epic, don't you think? |
| 6 | The world is a product of my imagination. The fact that you think you exist when I'm not thinking about you is adorable. |
| 7 | I'm quick to make friends and love winning over grumpy and stoic types. If they don't yet appreciate my help, that just means they need more of it! |
| 8 | I like to earn people's trust, then lead them into dangerous situations and make off with their treasure while they're distracted. |

##### Faerie Dragon Ideals

As is suggested by their name and nature, faerie dragons tend to prefer the company of Fey, as well as wild animals and any chaotic creatures who can appreciate faerie dragons' madcap sense of humor. At the same time, faerie dragons' limited attention spans often leave them starved for novelty, and nearly any creature can attract their interest—at least temporarily.

##### Faerie Dragon Connections

| 10 | A **faerie dragon** has intimidated a gang of **goblins** and now forces the goblins to follow an increasingly bizarre set of rules. |

### Faerie Dragon Lairs
Faerie dragons go where the fun is. For many, this means dwelling near portals to the Feywild, enjoying that realm's unpredictable magic and boisterous revels. Yet it can just as easily mean residing among other peoples—stealing baubles from shrines, nesting in cluttered attics, or following explorers and other intriguing individuals on their travels. For as much as they love their homes and hoards, faerie dragons abandon both without a second thought if adventure beckons.

Faerie dragon lairs are as varied and eccentric as their owners. Some resemble simple animal nests, hidden away in secret crevices or woven of twigs and trash in the forks of ancient trees. Faerie dragons may also draw on the trappings of civilization, perhaps stealing a child's dollhouse for use as a manor or convincing pixies to construct them a silken bower. The most elaborate faerie dragon lairs are modeled off those of larger dragons, featuring multiple chambers and cunning traps.

#### Faerie Dragon Lair Features
An example complex faerie dragon lair is built around several hollowed-out chambers inside a large dead tree. The tree is decorated with the dragon's lesser treasures, its limbs draped with scrolls and scarves and set with glittering glass. You could use part of the underground portion of the copper dragon's lair (*map 5.6*) to represent such a lair, with the scale reduced to 2½ feet per square, the hollow spaces tucked inside a massive tree trunk, and the passages running inside major branches rather than underground. A typical lair has the following features:

- **Trapped Entrance** Just inside the knothole that acts as the lair's main entrance, the dragon has hidden a stolen hunting trap.
- **Audience Chamber** The passage opens up into the audience chamber, where the dragon lounges on a pillow and entertains diminutive Fey guests (or, in lieu of Fey, a family of very confused squirrels).
- **Hoard and Larder** Beyond the audience chamber are separate hollows for the dragon's hoard ("shinies") and larder ("nibbles").
- **Sleeping Chamber** The innermost cavity of the lair is the sleeping chamber, which the dragon has fastidiously lined with fragments of mirrored glass. The dragon preens and holds long, complimentary conversations with myriad admiring reflections here.
- **Escape Tunnel** From the sleeping chamber, a concealed escape tunnel leads out through a hollow root before emerging in a thick briar patch.

#### Lair Actions
As they are presented in the *Monster Manual*, faerie dragons don't have access to lair actions while in their lairs. At your discretion, a green or **older faerie dragon** can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties):

- **Chaotic Aura** The faerie dragon creates misdirecting currents of air and magic around itself. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, whenever a ranged attack roll misses the dragon, reroll the attack against a random creature within 30 feet of the dragon that doesn't have total cover against the attack.
- **Grasping Plants** The faerie dragon causes roots and vines to temporarily grow around it; until initiative count 20 on the next round, the ground within 20 feet of the dragon is *difficult terrain*.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a faerie dragon's lair can be transformed by its presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Compulsory Offering** The first time a creature comes within 1 mile of the faerie dragon's lair, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or feel an overwhelming compulsion to leave an offering worth at least 5 gp stashed in an out-of-the-way place. The dragon immediately senses the location of this gift. A creature can be affected only once by this compulsion.
- **Malleable Time** Time is fluid within 1 mile of the faerie dragon's lair, flowing somewhere between half and twice its normal speed.
- **Mischief Afoot** Sapient creatures that spend a year within 5 miles of the faerie dragon's lair feel the persistent urge to play pranks on others.

If the faerie dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

### Faerie Dragon Treasures
Faerie dragons covet treasure as much as their larger draconic kin, but they are significantly less discerning. Faerie dragons' hoards are thus often a mix of genuine wealth and intriguing trash, with the dragons paying more attention to the wild stories they concoct around each item than the items' actual monetary value. These tiny egomaniacs can often be bribed with cheap but sufficiently respectful tributes of food and shiny trinkets, though their tendency to "borrow" any random object that catches their eye means a faerie dragon nest might also contain items of surprising value—often without the dragon realizing it.

> ##### Nathair Sgiathach
>Sometimes incorrectly assumed to be a god by non-dragons, Nathair Sgiathach (pronounced "nah-HAIR skee-HOKH") is the most famous of faerie dragon folk heroes. Like other faerie dragons, Nathair adores jokes—even those made at the dragon's expense—which makes Nathair particularly popular among their pixie, sprite, and other Fey associates. Though Nathair's magical powers are far greater than those of most faerie dragons (thanks in part to highly developed dragonsight), Nathair still prefers to resolve conflict with harmless pranks and absurdities, such as making an enemy's buttocks glow red and appear to sing folk tunes. When necessary, however, Nathair doesn't shy away from fighting to defend their beloved faerie folk. As such, some Fey teach their children to call Nathair Sgiathach's name in times of trouble, on the chance that the faerie dragon might be lurking invisibly nearby, as well as to put out ceremonial offerings of the faerie dragon's favorite food: apple pie.

## Gold Dragons
*Modrons have an inexplicable habit of mistaking gold dragons for their leader, Primus. The dragons don't mind, and the modrons don't seem to mind. So why do I find this so offensive?*— FizbanUse the tables, map, and other information in this section to craft unique encounters with gold dragons.

### Creating a Gold Dragon
Use the Gold Dragon Personality Traits and Gold Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive gold dragon characters, and use the Gold Dragon Spellcasting table to help select spells for a spellcasting dragon.

##### Gold Dragon Personality Traits
| d8 | Trait |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | I prefer to parley before combat. If villains can be reformed without violence, all the better. |
| 2 | Shorter-lived species often have difficulty perceiving the full scope of time's tapestry and lack the patience for my appropriately thorough explanations. |
| 3 | Others might find me cold and dispassionate, but such is the price of perspective. Few creatures enjoy confronting the relative smallness of their lives. |
| 4 | Disguises allow me to bestow small kindnesses and experience the simple pleasures of companionship without constantly being petitioned. I'm proud of my acting ability and never break character. |
| 5 | The future is writ large in the patterns of history. I enjoy conversing with others who think critically about history and society. |
| 6 | I enjoy gifts but find attempts to hire or bribe me deeply offensive. |
| 7 | My reclusiveness is a filter. If someone lacks the motivation to overcome my barriers, then their matter is unworthy of my attention. |
| 8 | On a long enough timescale, all actions are meaningless. So why should I deny myself anything? |

##### Gold Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Foresight. Righteous action requires carefully weighing potential consequences to ensure the cure is not worse than the disease. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Restraint. I cannot right every wrong. I encourage others to solve their own problems, and I save my strength for tribulations only I can address. (Any) |
| 3 | Stewardship. I do not serve individuals, but rather history. By acting strategically, I tip the ultimate balance toward justice and virtue. (Good) |
| 4 | Objectivity. I remain impartial in my judgments and refuse to let personal feelings get in the way of what's fair or necessary. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Isolation. Every interaction has ramifications that stretch on into infinity. I curate my impact on the world by remaining aloof and self-reliant. (Any) |
| 6 | Sovereignty. Other creatures lack my wisdom and must be controlled to prevent wrongdoing. (Evil) |

### Gold Dragon Lairs
Despite their affection for people and their diverse cultures, gold dragons typically make their lairs in hidden places far from civilization, where only the most desperate and dedicated can find them. Many live in the ruins of vanished cultures, appreciating the beautiful inevitability of entropy and the reminder of how easily progress can be lost without careful tending. Crumbling shrines, towers reclaimed by the wilderness, and fallen fortresses all appeal to a gold dragon's sense of history—though they can be equally enraptured by picturesque natural settings. A gold dragon lair almost always involves water, be it a river, a lake, or an ocean shore.

![[070-map-5.9-gold-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Gold Dragon Lair Features
The gold dragon lair shown in map 5.9 occupies a misty river gorge and has the following features:

- **Waterfall Cave** A rushing river cascades over the cliff in a scintillating waterfall, concealing the entrance to the dragon's cavern complex. Past this thundering curtain, a cave opens into the grand hall.
- **Grand Hall** Six glowing crystalline columns support the ceiling of this cave. The columns' colors reflect the dragon's mood, and they can animate to defend the lair.

> ##### Tamarand
>As the King of Justice, Tamarand is the nominal ruler of gold dragons throughout Faerûn. Other gold dragons seek out his wisdom before embarking on their own quests, to ensure they aren't overlooking any hidden consequences.
>
>Tamarand is thoughtful, decisive, and surprisingly friendly toward non-dragons. He has strong bonds with the **storm giants** of the Galena Mountains and is a dedicated scholar of Humanoid cultures, having seen firsthand just how powerful such creatures can be when properly organized. After narrowly escaping assassination by dragon hunters in his former lair near Bloodstone Pass, Tamarand currently resides in the Vaasan wilderness and keeps his exact location a closely guarded secret.
>

***Gallery.*** A passageway running left from the grand hall is lined with busts of allies and enemies from the dragon's past. This area contains the water mirror, a magical glass case filled by seepage from the river above, which the dragon uses to scry across both distance and time.

- **Sleeping Chamber** At the end of the gallery passage, the dragon's sleeping chamber opens up, its walls lined with shelves holding books and useful magic items.
- **Treasury Hall** Armored doors within the sleeping chamber lead to the dragon's treasury hall, which features an 80-foot sheer drop into a viewing gallery.
- **Hoard and Vault** A chamber on the right side of the treasury hall holds the dragon's hoard, which serves to distract would-be thieves from a store of dangerous and corrupting artifacts hidden in a secret vault opposite the hoard chamber.
- **Pantry** A rough chamber off the right side of the great hall acts as the dragon's pantry, holding racks of pearls and other gems.
- **Apartments** In the top right corner of the map, a worked-stone alcove leads to Humanoid-scale apartments to accommodate the dragon's most honored comrades, as well as the dragon in Humanoid form.
- **Pavilions** Outside the lair, weathered pavilions climb the cliffs overlooking the waterfall's plunge pool, offering a convenient place for the dragon to meet visitors. Beyond the pavilions, an elegant pathway winds through self-manicuring gardens before ending abruptly in trackless wilderness.

#### Additional Lair Action
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) gold dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:

- **Beguiling Glow** Warm light fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon; each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Regional Effects
Any of these effects might appear in the area around a gold dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Beneficent Trail** Within 10 miles of the dragon's lair, small runes in the shape of a gold dragon appear to creatures in great need, marking a subtle trail leading to the dragon's lair.
- **Emanation of Justice** Creatures that spend a year within 6 miles of the dragon's lair value fairness and justice over their personal feelings.
- **Liar's Revelation** Within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, any creature attempting to tell a deliberate lie must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or find itself accidentally revealing the truth it was attempting to conceal. The first time a creature fails this saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

### Gold Dragon Treasures
Gold dragons consider gems and pearls culinary delicacies, and they often have a section of their hoard that's as much pantry as treasury. Beyond such consumables, they prefer items they can learn from, whether rare historical or metaphysical texts, mysterious relics and curios, or puzzles and prophecies offering hints at the future.

Gold dragons also collect trophies marking important events and successes in their lives. But unlike many other dragons, they are just as likely to prize mementos of their defeats and mistakes, believing that such reminders are inherently instructive. Like bronze dragons, gold dragons often guard particularly dangerous artifacts as a form of public service, and thus prize clever magical or mundane defenses to keep their lairs safe and hidden.

##### Green Dragon Personality Traits
| d8 | Trait |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | You're either with me or you're against me. Just kidding—you're lunch either way! |
| 2 | I hate how much people think they matter in a world that was old before their kind even learned the idea of names. |
| 3 | The more the merrier as far as I'm concerned: more to control, more to torture, more to feast upon when I'm finally bored. |
| 4 | Bipedal life is too ugly and ignorant to merit even a scrap of compassion. |
| 5 | I like seeing life through the eyes of a lesser being—before forcing that creature to gouge their eyes out. |
| 6 | The wilds are mine and mine alone, and anyone who thinks they can enter my territory had best hope I have other distractions that day. |
| 7 | I allow others to dwell in my forest—if they act as my eyes, ears, and occasional playthings in return. |
| 8 | I harbor no animosity toward anyone. Let me grow ancient with my forest, and I'll leave you in peace. |

##### Green Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |

| 1 | Isolation. Territories can be properly established only when all parties respect the borders of their neighbors. (Lawful) |

| 3 | Respect. Fear is amusing, but reverence is delicious. (Any) |
| 4 | Intrigue. The world is so much more entertaining when no one trusts anyone. (Evil) |
| 5 | Imagination. Nothing is more gauche than repeating the same activities day after day. (Any) |

### Green Dragon Lairs
Green dragons prefer making their lairs in verdant places—jungles, bayous, pine forests, or anywhere with abundant vegetation that they can shape according to their desires. An older green dragon might indulge in horticulture, cultivating the local flora as befits their individual aesthetic. However, most green dragons are content to either excavate beneath trees and nestle among the roots or make lairs inside trees large enough to be hollowed out without compromising their structure.

Green dragons take great interest in woodland settlements when seeking lair sites. Though they are fully capable of modifying forests to their own liking, they find it easier and vastly more entertaining to take something belonging to smaller and weaker beings.

![[072-map-5.10-green-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Green Dragon Lair Features
The green dragon lair shown in map 5.10 was an enormous banyan tree once sacred to the wood elves who lived around it. The original host tree around which the banyan tree grew is now dead and has rotted away, leaving a large columnar shaft within the trunk of the banyan that the dragon has expanded into a subterranean lair. The banyan continues to grow and to swallow up other nearby trees.

The lair has the following features:

- **Canopy** The green dragon has teased the banyan's sprawling canopy into a bowl-like shape within which the dragon can comfortably lounge. Threaded through the branches are bones from the dragon's meals—some messily clustered among the leaves, and others deliberately arranged to create macabre dioramas for the dragon's amusement. Such grisly scenes can also be seen scattered throughout the lair as reminders of the dragon's power, and as distractions and warnings for would-be interlopers.
- **Underground** The hollow center of the tree gives access to the dragon's lair below, nestled among the banyan's sprawling roots. Three tunnels branch off from the vertical shaft at different levels—none of them at the very bottom. This means a creature that falls to the bottom must find a way to ascend at least as far as the lowest tunnel.
- **Hoard Chamber** All three passages eventually converge in the large chamber at the right side of the map, where most of the dragon's hoard is kept.

#### Additional Lair Actions
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) green dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Creeper Vines** The dragon can use the vines and roots within its lair to animate up to three Humanoid corpses, which become **zombies** (see their entry in the *Monster Manual*). The zombies take their turn immediately after this lair action. Each one reverts to an inanimate corpse after 1 minute, when the dragon uses this lair action again, or when the zombie is destroyed.
- **Lashing Root** One large root or branch that is part of the lair makes a melee attack roll against a creature within 10 feet of it. It has a +7 bonus to hit and deals 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

#### Regional Effects
Either or both of these effects might appear in the area around a green dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of those described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Inviting Whispers** Whispers rustle in the foliage within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as an invitation to move deeper into the greenery.
- **Twisted Messengers** The dragon can cause any Tiny Beast within 1 mile of its lair to act as its mouthpiece. The effect is horrendous, as the creature's throat and mouth temporarily warp into a twisted version of the dragon's own in order to allow the dragon's voice to issue forth.

![[073-05-007.webp|right|300]]

### Green Dragon Treasures
Green dragons relish gems and jewelry whose palettes reflect their chosen forest environments, favoring viridescent colors and bursts of floral brilliance. Many develop vast collections of emeralds and beryls as a result, punctuated by amber, red rubies, tiger's eyes, bismuth, and the like. They likewise covet finely crafted items and works of art depicting unspoiled nature.

Unlike many of their kin, green dragons use the transformative power of nature to turn those valuables into truly unique treasures. By wrapping and threading treasures with rare vegetation and carefully applying their own skill as gardeners, green dragons meld nature and artifice into new masterpieces. This can lead to complications for would-be treasure hunters, as green dragons take enormous pride in their handiwork—so much so that intruders damaging the delicate arrangements of flower and vine that surround a treasure cache might come under attack before even touching any of the hoard's contents.

| 8 | I find the whimsy of fey, and whimsy in general, to be exasperating and exhausting. |

##### Moonstone Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Curiosity. I might never be able to experience everything in the multiverse—but it doesn't hurt to try. (Any) |

### Moonstone Dragon Lairs
Often, a moonstone dragon's lair is not a single location, but rather a collection of personally significant places spread out across multiple planes of existence and connected through portals under the dragon's control. A lair might include a secluded grove on the Material Plane, a well-protected tower in the Feywild, and even a hidden corner of the Ethereal Plane. Moonstone dragons often use locations in the Feywild as their primary residences, locations on the Material Plane for entertaining guests, and locations on the Ethereal Plane for storage. Occasionally, though, a whimsical moonstone dragon delights in shaking things up, insisting that visitors come to the Border Ethereal for a meeting or sleeping in the middle of a heavily trafficked forest on the Material Plane.

Moonstone dragons navigate their multiplanar lairs by opening portals between planes at will. They sometimes forget to close those portals, allowing the inhabitants of one plane to wander into others.

#### Moonstone Dragon Lair Features
You can look to other maps in this chapter as inspiration for the scattered parts of a moonstone dragon's lair. For example, a well maintained and above-water version of the black dragon lair's tower (*map 5.2*) makes a great Feywild audience chamber, while a vibrant, living version of the green dragon lair's enormous tree (*map 5.10*) makes for a very comfortable bedchamber in a grove on the Material Plane. And features such as the cloud bridges of the silver dragon lair (*map 5.13*) can be used for the parts of a moonstone dragon's lair that lie in the Border Ethereal.

### Moonstone Dragon Treasures
Moonstone dragons prefer silver, platinum, and mithral to copper and gold, and white or silvery gems to more colorful ones. Some are simply uninterested in treasures made of what they consider inferior metals, but others actively dislike copper and gold creations and consider them aesthetically offensive. People who mistakenly offer these metals to the wrong moonstone dragon sometimes wake to find all their silver—and memory of the past few days—missing.

In addition to their strong preference for certain metals, many moonstone dragons seek out artworks and relics with unique, whimsical, or absurd designs. The more fanciful an item's form is, the better.

##### Moonstone Dragon Art Objects
| d8 | Object |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A statue of a beautiful Fey who appears to be laughing, crying, or scowling, depending on the viewer's mood; the dragon requires all who visit to describe the face and sends away anyone who sees an angry visage |
| 2 | A string of leaves collected from the rarest trees in the Feywild and then dipped in silver |
| 3 | A small mithral ball that shows significant scuffing, as the dragon plays with it constantly |
| 4 | A mobile from which hang six figurines of pixies and sprites; the dragon insists that Fey allies address any questions and concerns to the figurines |
| 5 | A painting of a beautiful Feywild vista; the dragon studies the painting every day for clues about the vista's whereabouts |
| 6 | An ornate silver chest that holds a mountain of gold coins; the dragon refuses to open the chest, claiming it can still smell the stink of the "noxious metal" |
| 7 | A collection of gem-encrusted pitchers, decanters, and goblets; the dragon will not consume faerie nectar unless it is served in one of these items |
| 8 | A vast bookshelf full of dream journals written by creatures the dragon has befriended over the years; the dragon has each entry illustrated by a different celebrated artist, making the library one of the largest art collections in the world |

##### Red Dragon Personality Traits
| d8 | Trait |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | The thrill of the hunt and of battle makes my blood burn and stokes the fire in my heart. A pity there are so few foes and so little prey worthy of me. |
| 2 | The worship of smaller creatures pleases me, though their weakness is pathetic—how can they do other than adore me? |
| 3 | Nothing is better than to sleep and dream upon my hoard with the warmth of a full belly. Let those who would disturb me beware! |
| 4 | Ah, if these foolish creatures only knew they were but pawns in the games I play to amuse myself. |
| 5 | I know that others seek to steal my treasures, my beautiful baubles, won through strength and cunning. But they are mine. Mine! |
| 6 | All that I survey, I could easily destroy. From time to time, it is important to remind these small creatures of the true extent of my power. |
| 7 | Although my power and life span are vast, they have merely whetted my appetite for immortality. |
| 8 | Heroes need foes to test them. Not all teachers can afford to be kind, and some lessons must be harsh. |

##### Red Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Cruelty. Pain and fear are the most powerful tools. With them, any creature's will can be broken. (Evil) |
| 2 | Might. Only the strongest survive and prosper, so I must be the strongest of all. (Any) |
| 3 | Greed. If I desire a thing, then it must be mine and mine alone. (Evil) |
| 4 | Respect. All that I have achieved must be acknowledged and treated with the utmost respect. (Any) |
| 5 | No Limits. I do whatever I please, whenever it pleases me to do so. (Chaotic) |
| 6 | Responsibility. Fire destroys, but it can also temper when it is applied carefully—if the material tested is strong enough. (Lawful) |

#### Connected Creatures
Red dragons treat other creatures as potential servants or pawns, valuable only as long as they fulfill the dragon's needs. Many red dragons terrorize creatures into serving them—and sometimes into worshiping them as well. Others build up shadowy networks of manipulation and control, so many of their servants have no idea who the true ruler is.

| 4 | A **balor** demon hopes an **ancient red dragon's** dragonsight can help the demon coordinate a multidimensional play for power in the Abyss. |

### Red Dragon Lairs
Red dragons lair in mountain badlands and high, isolated peaks and hills, preferring warm caverns in the rocky depths beneath those landscapes. Lairs with natural geothermal or lava vents are highly sought after, as these features create an environment ideally suited to the dragons' taste.

Minions often attend red dragons in their lairs. These servants keep the place swept clean of refuse and watch out for intruders, while providing the imperious dragon with subjects to bully and command. Some minions worship the dragon and serve willingly, but others would escape if they could.

![[076-map-5.11-red-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Red Dragon Lair Features
The red dragon lair shown in map 5.11 is inside the caldera of an active volcano. **Azers** dug out and expanded the lava tunnels within the volcano's peak, just above the level of the caldera's lava pools. Although the azers are long since gone, their construction—and much of their lost wealth—now serves the dragon's needs. That construction also provides a network of tunnels too small for the dragon to use, but where other creatures can make their lairs.

The lair has the following features:

- **Caldera** The steep sides of the caldera drop away from the edge of the cone, making a 60-foot descent to the lava below. The rough rock of the caldera is not overly difficult to climb, but the area grows increasingly hot as creatures descend.
- **Pillared Hall** The dragon sleeps in the large hall on the left edge of the map, where a row of crumbling pillars supports the ceiling and a narrow channel of lava keeps the hall hot.
- **Hoard** A side tunnel off the pillared hall descends 30 feet down a steep lava tube to a ledge above a pool of magma. Here the dragon has piled a hoard that gleams in the dull red light.

#### Additional Lair Actions
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) red dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Noxious Smoke** A cloud of thick, dark smoke fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is *heavily obscured*. A creature other than the dragon that starts its turn in the cloud or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. The cloud lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.
- **Searing Heat** Searing heat spreads out in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature that enters the affected area or starts its turn there must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The heat lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Regional Effects
Any of these effects might appear in the area around a red dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Desertification** Precipitation is almost nonexistent within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, making the land parched and arid and most plant life withered and brown.
- **Fiery Senses** The dragon can hear up to 30 feet through any open flame within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.
- **Ominous Flames** Open flames within 6 miles of the dragon's lair are tinged dark red, hiss and crackle constantly, and throw off embers and showers of sparks.

### Red Dragon Treasures
Red dragons love gold above all other precious metals and are entranced by its gleam, its luster, and the sound of its chime. They amass gold coins and objects to form the bulk of their hoards, along with red and fiery gemstones such as rubies and fire opals. Red dragons favor items made of metal and stone, which can survive the test of time. Many such items in an **ancient red dragon's** hoard might be hundreds or thousands of years old. They tend to eschew treasures that burn, such as leather, paper, and cloth items.

For a red dragon, every treasure is a mark of pride and a personal trophy. Like a proud hunter, a red dragon relishes telling the tale of acquiring each individual relic or coin, glorifying the dragon's own deeds.

##### Red Dragon Art Objects
| d12 | Object |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A hammered metal brazier elaborately etched and set with polished obsidian, which sits atop a stand holding rare incense blends |
| 2 | A beautifully inlaid mosaic map of the region within a 100-mile radius of the dragon's lair |
| 3 | A life-sized basalt statue of a fierce knight, weapon raised to strike, which might be the preserved form of an actual knight turned to stone |

| 11 | A beautifully wrought crown set with fiery gemstones, possibly the legacy of a lost empire |

> ##### Ashardalon
>The terrible red dragon Ashardalon is spoken of in legends across the multiverse for his terrible rampages, which turned lush grasslands into ashen plains and caused mighty citadels to be swallowed up in the earth. As he awakened his dragonsight, he recruited a balor demon named Ammet, the Eater of Souls, to help him drain the power of his echoes on other worlds. When he was struck a mortal blow to the heart, he replaced the injured organ with the balor. This transplant has lent a fiendish cast to his features, and his eyes glow with demonic flame. A secretive cult of Ashardalon's followers and spawn serves him on the Material Plane, furthering the dragon's schemes to attain godhood.

| 1 | I often fixate on specific historical battles or wars and won't rest until my hoard contains that conflict's most significant artifacts. |

| 4 | Order. An organized hoard makes me happy—and you don't want to see me unhappy. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Preparation. Justice and righteousness do not guarantee victory. Planning and tactics do. (Lawful) |
| 6 | Companionship. Sure, my hoard brings me great joy. But the real treasures are the guests who stop by to see it. (Good) |

### Sapphire Dragon Lairs
Sapphire dragons make their lairs in enormous caverns and complex tunnel systems. As they grow older, they continually renovate their lairs, using their tunneling abilities and command over stone.

Sapphire dragons eventually create dizzying honeycombs of hidden passages, deceptively thin walls, and secret chambers that allow them to traverse the entire lair without ever being seen by intruders. The best-defended sapphire dragon lairs have no easily accessible entrances or exits at all, and trespassers who do find their way inside must then contend with a maze of corridors, dead ends, and steep inclines.

![[078-map-5.12-sapphire-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Sapphire Dragon Lair Features
The sapphire dragon lair shown in map 5.12 is a series of natural tunnels and chambers the dragon has adapted to serve as a lair. The lair has few natural entrances, so whole sections are inaccessible without excavation or magic, as the dragon can simply open doorways in walls whenever necessary.

The lair has the following features:

- **Disguised Entrances** An otherwise unremarkable cave (shown at the top of the map) provides the main access to the lair by way of two sections of relatively thin crystal walls. The dragon can use a lair action to open or close passages through these walls throughout the lair.
- **Cobweb-Choked Tunnels** Adventurers who manage to access the other side of the cave's crystal walls discover a network of dark, cobweb-choked tunnels extending deep into the earth, set with natural steps and shelves throughout. The dragon spends little time in this part of the lair, visiting only when the spiders there need tending—or when the dragon needs a snack.
- **Underground River** A river flows along the right and bottom edges of the map, providing the dragon with fresh water and an alternative entrance. Originating on the surface, the river descends through narrow tunnels that eventually lead to the Underdark.

> ##### Bleucorundum
>Bleucorundum is an **ancient sapphire dragon** with an equally ancient hatred of **beholders** and their kin. After losing both parents to beholder attacks, he fled to the Lake of Steam in southern Faerûn. There, he discovered the resting place of a martial order known as the Knights of the Crescent Moon, who had fought beholders in an ancient war. Bleucorundum found the knights held in stasis, awaiting the day they would be called upon to fight their ancient enemies again, and he vowed to guard them until they awaken. He styles himself the Sapphire Sentinel, self-appointed guardian of the Sleeping Legion. But his vigil is lonely, and his servitor **gargoyles** provide little companionship.
>

- **Hoard Caverns** The bulk of the lair, filling most of the lower half of the map, comprises chambers the dragon uses to host guests and visitors. These caverns hold the bulk of the dragon's hoard, particularly art objects that are impressive but not irreplaceable.
- **Sleeping Chamber** At the heart of the lair, protected behind more thin crystal walls, the largest cavern serves as the dragon's sleeping chamber. A raised section studded with sapphire crystals offers a vantage from which the dragon can keep an eye on the chamber's access points. The dragon's most valuable treasures are stored here and in adjoining caves, and the walls of this central chamber are covered in art depicting various battles—many of which the dragon took part in.

### Sapphire Dragon Treasures
Sapphire dragons covet items of martial significance above other treasure. Weapons and armor from epic conflicts are usually the centerpieces of a sapphire dragon's hoard, set alongside military histories, treatises on warfare, and battle mementos, as well as trophies from the dragon's own conquests of subterranean foes such as illithids and aboleths.

Sapphire dragons meticulously catalogue their hoards. Each dragon has a unique organizational system; some are straightforward, but some only the dragon can fully comprehend (weapons categorized by which armies they were used against, armor ordered by the ancestry of its last wearer, and so forth). Regardless of the system, a sapphire dragon takes pride in knowing exactly where any given item is and can recite a detailed history of that item while guiding curious guests to (or away from) it.

### Creating a Shadow Dragon
Use the Shadow Dragon Personality Traits and Shadow Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive shadow dragon characters.

If you use the variant rule in the *Monster Manual* for making a dragon a spellcaster, shadow dragons typically have the spellcasting ability of their original forms. Over time, some shadow dragons might replace one or more of their innate spells with spells more appropriate to their tenebrous nature, such as *darkness*, *fog cloud*, *misty step*, or *nondetection*.

### Shadow Dragon Lairs
When dragons become aware of the Shadowfell's malign influence seeping into their territories, most scoop up their hoards and abandon any compromised lairs. But some are stubborn, prideful, or bitter enough to stay, even in the face of inevitable corruption. More often, a dragon is unknowingly swept up by the Shadowfell while asleep, awakening after a years-long rest to find that both dragon and lair have changed. In these cases, a shadow dragon's lair undergoes the same transformation as the dragon, becoming a shadowy, melancholic version of the original site.

Shadow dragons that are born on the Shadowfell or seek out new lairs after their transformations establish lairs according to the preferences of their kind, though they find comfort only in the most gloomy and cheerless of places. Reconciling these sometimes-contrasting urges can lead to some very unusual lair choices.

As an example, consider the red dragon lair in *map 5.11* as the lair of a red shadow dragon. In this case, the once-active volcano has now lapsed into dormancy. Its lava flows have cooled into a blackened, alien landscape. Ash coats the slopes of the caldera, picked up by the weird swirling winds common to this region and drawn into the atmosphere. Clouds of ash periodically cast the surrounding lands into deep shadow, before the fine grit once again falls to the ground in a hazy gray blizzard. The shadow dragon prowls the region during these hazes, rendered all but invisible by the eddies of ash.

In the heart of the lair, even the brightest light is muted, and creatures find their eyes playing tricks on them as details and distance are distorted. The shadow dragon rarely leaves this place except to hunt and is attended by dozens of shadows.

#### Additional Lair Action
Shadow dragons have access to the lair actions usable by untransformed dragons of the same kind. The effects of these actions might be cosmetically altered, seeming darker, gloomier, and more subdued. They might also deal necrotic damage instead of other damage types. At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) shadow dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:

- **Banish Light** Any nonmagical source of illumination within a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon is snuffed out, and any spell that creates light within that same area is dispelled.

#### Regional Effects
When a shadow dragon establishes a lair on the Material Plane, the region around the lair takes on some of the characteristics of the Shadowfell, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Brooding Despair** Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair that have an Intelligence score of 5 or higher feel forlorn and hopeless.
- **Dying Light** Light is diminished within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, *lightly obscuring* the land in gloomy shadows.
- **Gloomy Portals** Some caves, caverns, pits, and other places of deep gloom within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Shadowfell, allowing creatures from that plane to dwell nearby.

### Shadow Dragon Treasures
Shadow dragons retain the preferences of their original form when it comes to treasure. With each passing year, though, the more lustrous objects in their hoards begin to instill a sort of revulsion in the shadow dragons, much as sunlight does. Gleaming coins and shiny baubles sicken and anger them, and they blunt and tarnish these items to make them easier to look on. Ebony, onyx, and similar dark-hued valuables bring shadow dragons no particular joy, but they aren't as inherently repellent as silver, platinum, and diamonds.

Beauty fills shadow dragons with contempt, and that is true of the treasures they collect as well. Though they cannot abandon their hoards, shadow dragons hide them away even from their own sight. The most resplendent items are always the best hidden, and a shadow dragon's lair contains a great many secret caches. An ancient shadow dragon might have a hundred or more such repositories secreted about their territory, making stealing from a shadow dragon both difficult and dangerous.

### Silver Dragon Lairs
Silver dragons make their lairs on mountaintops and in the clouds. Often, this has less to do with concerns such as security and privacy, and more to do with meeting or exceeding expectations. If humans, elves, and dwarves expect dragons to be found in such lofty environs, that's what they'll get.

This inclination toward using high-altitude locales as sites for lairs isn't without complications, though. Silver dragons often end up in competition with other dragons, notably red dragons, for control of such places. And even after establishing their lairs, silver dragons often need to fight to protect their dominion.

The lair of a silver dragon is always an impressive sight. Young dragons make their homes in icy cliffs, excavating space for themselves within the mountainside. Older silver dragons sometimes decorate their cliff-side habitats with ruins carefully collected from other places in the world. Depending on the dragon, a lair can be a multi-tiered affair, with its highest levels extending fully into the sky.

![[080-map-5.13-silver-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Silver Dragon Lair Features
The silver dragon lair shown in map 5.13 is composed of three connected sections—an antechamber, an open court, and a majestic temple. The lair has the following features:

- **Antechamber** The antechamber was once an ancient throne room or mountain shrine, but time has eroded any clues as to its original builders. Its walls are hung with velvet tapestries featuring heroic figures performing a variety of glorious acts.
- **Side Chambers** A few small private side chambers allow the dragon (usually in Humanoid guise) to meet with visitors.
- **Cloud Bridge** From the antechamber, visitors travel upward along a path of clouds. The impressive route is not as dangerous as its lack of railings and the literal airiness of each footstep might suggest.
- **Open Court** Past the cloud bridge is an enormous expanse of smooth stone ringed with broken pillars, where the silver dragon hosts visitors in grand style. Though this court is often surrounded by clouds, the dragon can clear them away with a moment's thought, revealing a breathtaking view of the surrounding region.
- **Majestic Temple** The final section of the lair is a grand domed temple set with a plethora of comfortable furnishings. Here and there, souvenirs from the silver dragon's long life are positioned with great care.
- **Under Temple** A broad shaft in the temple opens into a treasury chamber below, where the dragon's hoard is arranged in gleaming splendor.

#### Additional Lair Action
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) silver dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:

- **Icy Grip** A sudden, supernatural chill fills the lair near the dragon. Each creature of the dragon's choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round. Creatures that have resistance to cold damage have advantage on the saving throw; creatures that have immunity to cold damage succeed automatically.

> ##### D'argent
>Like so many silver dragons, D'argent takes considerable interest in the matters of mortals on her home world of Krynn. The **ancient dragon** rarely openly participates in heroics, preferring to help in more surreptitious ways. She has been known to join in the conflicts of mortals in disguise, either as a brave human knight or as a fierce elf healer with gleaming silver hair, named Silvara.
>
>Though she is happy to remain in the background, D'argent's seeming placidity hides a brilliant intellect, and she has exposed the machinations of many chromatic dragons on Krynn. She is a romantic at heart, and it is said that she has fallen deeply for mortals more than once.
>

### Silver Dragon Treasures
More than anything else, silver dragons covet mementos from the people they interact with. Whether these are sentimental gifts worthless to anyone except their recipient or medals from a grateful monarch, silver dragons want them all. As such, many silver dragons have eclectic hoards brimming with trinkets and equipment from their own travels: from epaulets to hats, weapons to hunting horns, and even entire longships preserved with magic. Many also maintain a collection of portraits they've had commissioned over centuries to chronicle the ongoing changes in the art world. In some cases, these portraits are a dragon's most prized possessions.

Beyond such keepsakes, silver dragons prefer treasures that complement their natural coloration. Diamonds are much coveted, but also turquoise, malachite, and sapphires, all of pelagic hues like something plucked from the deep ocean. Some silver dragons also collect ornamental weapons or ingenious examples of technology.

### Creating a Topaz Dragon
Use the Topaz Dragon Personality Traits and Topaz Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive topaz dragon characters.

##### Topaz Dragon Personality Traits
| d8 | Trait |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | I seek no company other than my own, for no one else can compete with me. |
| 2 | If my offspring can't care for themselves, I'm not sure they're worthy of my attention. |
| 3 | The sea is beautiful and I love gazing upon it, but I abhor being wet. |
| 4 | Why should I risk damaging my splendid physique when I can fight with the power of my mind? |
| 5 | I am predictable only in my unpredictability. |
| 6 | It takes true artistry to maintain a warm, desert-like dwelling under the water. |
| 7 | I soothe myself to sleep by imagining the perfect insults for bronze dragons; while I wait to meet one, I hone them on other creatures. |
| 8 | I secretly enjoy conversing with lesser beings, although I usually do so only to find their weaknesses. |

##### Topaz Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Solitude. My own company obviates the need for others in my life, whether they are dragons or lesser creatures. (Any) |
| 2 | Change. Consistency is stagnation. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | Mental Superiority. I hone my mental powers so I can confuse, control, or kill any who annoy me. (Evil) |
| 4 | Territoriality. Any creature that comes into my territory has forfeited its right to be upset by anything I do to it. (Evil) |
| 5 | Wonder. Though I don't wish to spend time in it, my soul sings at the sight of the vast beauty of the ocean. (Good) |
| 6 | Code of Combat. I despise most other dragons, but I meet them face to face without resorting to the base trickery I use on lesser creatures. (Lawful) |

### Topaz Dragon Adventures
The Topaz Dragon Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for stories and adventures involving topaz dragons.

##### Topaz Dragon Adventure Hooks
| d8 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A pirate ship is found floating on the open sea, the bodies of the crew completely desiccated. The only clue to what happened is a single topaz dragon scale on the deck. |
| 2 | A topaz dragon has claimed a stretch of coastline and ordered the residents of a seaside town to vacate the area or suffer the dragon's wrath. |
| 3 | A fishery that specializes in a type of eel favored by a local topaz dragon is "haunted," and shipments of the eel vanish every time the ghost appears. |
| 4 | Legends claim that a gauntlet imbued with divine power rests in a temple beneath the waves. Unfortunately, that temple is now the lair of an especially tricky topaz dragon. |
| 5 | A topaz dragon is injured and stranded far from the sea, but the dragon is too proud to ask for help getting home. |
| 6 | A topaz dragon is building a tableau of desiccated creatures and has grown obsessed with catching one treasure hunter who escaped the dragon's clutches. |

| 8 | A topaz dragon is intent on destroying the homes of all intelligent creatures in the dragon's territory, and desperate locals seek to find out what's behind the dragon's wrath. |

#### Connected Creatures
Topaz dragons rarely tolerate any company but their own, and they are usually indifferent at best even toward their own kind. Moreover, their unpredictability means that even if a creature proves itself useful to a topaz dragon, it shouldn't count on being safe from the dragon the next time they meet. Topaz dragons rarely go out of their way to fight other creatures, however, with the exception of bronze dragons, for whom they bear an inexplicably intense hatred.

| 4 | An **ancient bronze dragon** and an **ancient topaz dragon** are locked in an ongoing conflict that threatens shipping and caravans around a major city. |

### Topaz Dragon Lairs
Topaz dragons are happiest by the sea. They spend most of their time basking in the sun and have no desire to get wet, beyond enjoying a bit of sea spray in the air. But they love being able to see the water, so they build their lairs on the heights of seaside cliffs or near perfect sunbathing beaches where they can best accomplish this.

Their preference for lair sites frequently brings topaz dragons into conflict with other creatures, since they resent having to share their chosen scenic locations with anything that isn't food. They often abandon lairs to seek new vistas, so the interiors of their lairs often feel less finished than those of other dragons. Topaz dragons decorate their lairs with mirrors to make them look bigger and brighter, as well as fabric and objects in golden shades that complement their scales. They obsessively organize their hoards but almost never show them to anyone else.

![[082-map-5.14-topaz-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### Topaz Dragon Lair Features
The topaz dragon lair shown in map 5.14 is situated among the rocky cliffs and beaches of a rugged coastline. The lair is set in a cavern complex near the top of the cliffs, 50 feet above the sandy beaches, outcroppings, and islands below. It has the following features:

- **Outcropping** A flat outcropping with sheer limestone sides, mostly bare, offers a comfortable spot where the dragon can bask in the sunlight and watch the waves below.
- **Entry Tunnel** A long tunnel leads from the outcropping to the heart of the lair.
- **Decorated Caverns** The walls of the lair are mostly still in their natural state but are hung with the dragon's collection of nautical paintings, mirrors, and sun-colored tapestries. Numerous gold-and-glass hanging lanterns are suspended from the ceiling, giving the place a warm, cozy glow. (The lanterns might be magical or maintained by minions.) The floors are covered with plush sand-colored carpets.
- **Hoard Chamber** A small chamber in the upper left corner of the map contains the dragon's hoard. The area is decorated in a similar fashion to the main chamber, and its collected jewels and gold are painstakingly organized and tucked into chests stacked on gold-chased shelves.
- **Clifftop Path** A second exit from the cave allows the dragon quick access to the lair and leads to a narrow path bordered on the right by a sheer 50-foot drop and on the left by a cliff wall just as steep and devoid of hand- or footholds. The dragon has festooned this path with tripwire alarms and minor booby traps.
- **Islands** Three small islands jut from the water below the outcropping. The largest features cliffs that rise steeply to a plateau 40 feet above sea level. The dragon sometimes basks here as well and takes many meals atop the plateau.

> ##### Astilabor
>Like many greatwyrms, the topaz **Astilabor** is often mistakenly identified as a dragon god—in this case, the god of greed. In many ways, she is an archetype for all dragonkind, embodying the desire to acquire and hoard wealth. Her desire is born not of greed, though, but rather from her study of the Material Plane, its magic, and dragons' interconnection with both. Dragons on many worlds acknowledge Astilabor as they establish new lairs to host their hoards, linking them to the magic of the surrounding region.

### Topaz Dragon Treasures
Topaz dragons despise anything made of bronze but love to hoard gold, as well as yellow and orange gems that coordinate with their scales. They also favor treasures with a nautical theme; images of the sun; and mirrors, which they use to gaze at their own reflections and to redirect sunlight into their caves.

Topaz dragons like to keep their lairs well lit and can spend endless hours watching the play of light upon their treasures. They sometimes obsessively arrange their hoards by minute gradations in color and set up mirrors around a hoard chamber to make the mass of treasure appear bigger. But whatever pride topaz dragons take in their hoard, they have little desire to show it off, so even those rare creatures who maintain cordial relationships with a topaz dragon are unlikely to ever see the dragon's treasures.

## White Dragons
*I enjoy an animated debate... just not with a white dragon. Impossible and ignorant, all of them. The air must be different in their arctic latitudes.*— FizbanUse the tables, map, and other information in this section to craft unique encounters with white dragons.

### Creating a White Dragon
Use the White Dragon Personality Traits and White Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive white dragon characters, and use the White Dragon Spellcasting table to help select spells for a spellcasting dragon.

##### White Dragon Personality Traits
| d8 | Trait |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Talkative people are usually the most dangerous. I like to eat them first. |
| 2 | I brood over past encounters with foes and sometimes mistake newcomers for my ancient enemies. |
| 3 | I can recall many tidbits of lore picked up over the centuries but have no sense of their import. |
| 4 | I don't like the taste of warm blood and always rinse my mouth out with snow after a fight. |
| 5 | Whenever I encounter a new type of creature, I try to lure it back to my lair so I can add it to my collection of frozen trophies. |
| 6 | I have named the wind that blows through my lair and speak to it often. It is my sole companion. |
| 7 | I meet any challenge to my territory with aggression, even if I can't win outright. |
| 8 | I feel protective of smaller, weaker creatures that are tormented by larger monsters. |

##### White Dragon Ideals
| d6 | Ideal |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Rapacity. When a creature has the misfortune of crossing my path, I ask myself two questions: Am I hungry now? And if not, will I be hungry later? (Any) |
| 2 | Survival. This world is harsh and unforgiving, and so am I. I do whatever it takes to survive. (Any) |
| 3 | Dominance. I delight in making others tremble, knowing that I could kill them at any time. (Evil) |
| 4 | Isolation. All creatures are either prey or rivals. What do you mean by "company?" (Any) |
| 5 | Vengeance. Every scar upon my scales, every treasure beyond my reach, is a slight that must be answered. (Evil) |
| 6 | Service. I used to live as a beast, before learning what is possible when creatures put aside their petty needs in service of a greater goal. (Lawful) |

##### White Dragon Spellcasting
| Age | Spell Save DC | Spells Known |
|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Young** | 12 | *gust of wind* |
| **Adult** | 14 | *gust of wind* |

### White Dragon Adventures
The White Dragon Adventure Hooks table offers suggestions for stories and adventures involving white dragons.

##### White Dragon Adventure Hooks
| d8 | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A white dragon has been starving out a fortified settlement by decimating the local caribou herds. |
| 2 | The words of a ritual to propitiate a vengeful spirit are tattooed on the flesh of a frost giant druid—who is entombed in the ice of a white dragon's lair. |
| 3 | **Aarakocra** have become a nuisance in the lowlands ever since they were driven out of their mountain aerie by the arrival of a white dragon. |
| 4 | An item stolen from a white dragon's hoard has been passed down to an adventurer as a family heirloom—and the dragon is coming to get it back. |

#### Connected Creatures
Savage and territorial by nature, white dragons seldom set out to make alliances, though some come to understand the utility of doing so as they age. More often, white dragons encountered in the company of other creatures have been forced into an uneasy accommodation or a resentful servitude because they lack the power to dominate those companions outright.

##### Young White Dragon Connections
| d6 | Connected Creatures |

| 1 | A **young white dragon** and a **young remorhaz** are vying for control of the same territory, and their altercations endanger the other creatures in the area. |
| 2 | A **young white dragon** has gained control of an **invisible stalker** and sends it out to steal treasure. |

| 8 | A clan of **winged kobolds** treat the air currents and ice slides of an **adult white dragon's** lair as an obstacle course. The dragon enjoys devising increasingly hazardous routes for the kobolds to tackle. |

##### Ancient White Dragon Connections
| d4 | Connected Creatures |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A **death knight** and an **ancient white dragon** swap tales of old foes and unanswered grievances, nursing the hunger for vengeance that sustains them. |
| 2 | An **ancient white dragon** makes intermittent assaults against a mated pair of **adult silver dragons** who lair nearby. |

### White Dragon Lairs
A white dragon's lair is a place of freezing temperatures and profound solitude. Forgotten mountain holds, inaccessible chasms, and frozen caverns buried deep beneath glacial ice are typical of the places white dragons seek out to make their homes.

White dragons enjoy the mournful sound of the wind and frequently choose lairs with long, winding tunnels down which icy gusts can travel. They seldom work to improve their lairs, but when they do, it is often to channel wind currents to create effects the dragon finds pleasing. The labyrinthine tunnels and the mirror-like icy surfaces in a white dragon's lair confound would-be thieves and might foil their escape.

![[084-map-5.15-white-dragon-lair-player.webp|right|300]](Player Version)
#### White Dragon Lair Features
The white dragon lair shown in map 5.15 is a natural stone grotto set in a cliff side capped by a glacial ice sheet. It has the following features:

- **Cave Entrance** The entrance is a cave that opens into the cliff's rocky base. When the dragon goes out hunting, a wall of ice blocks the cave's entrance. But while in residence, the dragon leaves the cave mouth open to let the lair "breathe."
- **Frozen Stream** The cave's interior is a twisting stone tunnel carved out by a subterranean stream, now frozen over by the dragon's presence. The stream spills down in stages over low, frozen cascades, creating an icy stairway.
- **Dining Hall** A small chamber adjoining the stream just inside the cave's entrance is the dragon's dining hall; it contains the horrid remnants of recent meals.

![[085-05-009.webp|right|300]]

- **Rocky Grotto** Past the topmost cascade is the grotto floor, a rocky cavern dimly lit by blue light filtering through the icy vault high above. The largest of the dragon's frozen trophies are scattered about the grotto.
- **Low Cavern** Beyond the grotto, the stream leads to a low-ceilinged cavern the dragon used as a sleeping place when smaller; it might now serve as a home for the dragon's minions.
- **Upper Cavern** High above the grotto floor is a large cave where the dragon rests and stores the bulk of the dragon's hoard. The cave opens onto a narrow stone shelf that juts out from the grotto's walls and nearly encircles it. The shelf is stable but icy, and there is no obvious means of reaching it except for flying or scaling the sheer rock walls.
- **Icy Dome** Above the shelf is a frozen dome riddled with icicles. The ice here is just thin enough for the dragon to burst through to the open air if a quick escape is necessary.

#### Additional Lair Actions
At your discretion, a legendary (**adult** or **ancient**) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:

- **Blinding Sleet** Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.
- **Whirling Wind** A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for rules on *strong wind*). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.

#### Regional Effects
Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the *Monster Manual*:

- **Biting Chill** Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for rules on *extreme cold*). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.
- **Mirror Ice** The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.

### White Dragon Treasures
White dragons favor gems and precious metals that mirror the cold sparkle of ice. The floors of their lairs are often scattered with diamonds, moonstones, and quartz, as well as with silver and platinum coins, creating the impression of a river of stars when light spills across it. Though white dragons still value gold and copper, they usually bury such metals in pits filled with rock or snow to keep their yellow gleam from spoiling the look of their lair.

> ##### Rime
>Rime is a prisoner to her past. This now- **ancient white dragon** was raised in captivity, bred as a mount for an ancient knightly order. Mithral plates were magically fused to her skull and breastbone, bearing an enchantment binding her to the service of her rider. And though that rider and their order have been dead for centuries, the magic of the mithral plates still binds Rime to the place of her rider's demise. Only in the winter, when her powers are at their peak, can she range out from the ruined citadel that has become her lair to terrorize surrounding lands.
>
>Rime's past experience makes her suspicious of all Humanoids, and she frequently vents her wrath on them without provocation. However, she suffers the presence of the cultists who have taken up residence in her lair, since they bring her food during the long months when she cannot hunt. Rime also seeks a way to rid herself of her mithral shackles and will warily engage in conversation with spellcasters who might help her. Failing that, her plan is to continue to amass treasure during her winter raids until she is powerful enough to break her bonds completely.
>

The greater part of a white dragon's hoard consists of trophies taken from defeated foes. Although these trophies include items such as mighty weapons or ornate regalia that are valuable treasures in their own right, they can just as easily be worthless junk. A white dragon hoards trophies not for their material value, but as testaments to the dragon's dominance. An **ancient white dragon's** lair is a literal memory palace and a maze of rime-encrusted treasures that recount the story of the dragon's many victories.

##### White Dragon Art Objects

| 4 | A giant-sized cloak decorated with silver braiding that the dragon uses as a nest lining for its egg |
| 5 | A wooden throne heaped with furs; any visitors must sit on the throne while the dragon recounts the grisly death of the seat's previous owner |
| 6 | A huge wooden door carved and painted to depict a monarch enthroned with sword and scepter; the dragon occasionally raps the door with its knuckles, pauses, and then chortles, "Nobody home" |
| 7 | A frost giant jarl's crown with broken horns; the dragon enjoys perching the crown on an icy stalagmite and then knocking it off with its tail |
| 8 | The prow of a ship carved to look like a pouncing lion; the dragon occasionally roars at the lion |
| 9 | A gilded shield emblazoned with the holy symbol of a forgotten god; the dragon enjoys flicking the shield with a claw to hear the sound it makes |
| 10 | A ceremonial anvil of dwarven make; gazing at the anvil, the dragon fondly recounts, "Seven at one blow!" |
| 11 | A long, embroidered linen tapestry showing the history of an ancient realm's civil war; the dragon "reads" the tapestry when it has trouble sleeping. |
| 12 | A bell engraved with images of an angelic host, still attached to its splintered belfry; the dragon tolls the bell with its tail, growling the name of one of its defeated foes with each ring |
