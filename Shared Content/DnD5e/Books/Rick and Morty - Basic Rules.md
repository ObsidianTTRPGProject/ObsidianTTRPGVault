# Chapter 1: How to Play
The Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. Like games of make-believe, D&D is driven by imagination. It's about picturing a crumbling castle in a darkening forest and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents. In this fantasy world, the possibilities are limitless.

> That's a really poetic o-o-opening, Morty, and it's all kinda mostly true, but the theater major who wrote that forgot to mention... 
>

>POWER, morty!
>
>The most important part of D&D.
>
>People play this game because they want limitless power and treasure and to act like a complete badass all the time.
>
>I-I-I mean, honestly, it's the illusion of power, Morty. We play games to distract ourselves from the reality that the universe is an unfeeling, uncontrollable s***storm and everything we do is MEANINGLESS, but fine, fine. That's just a b-b-*BURP*-baseline assumption we have to make because this is a human game for human people.

>Dungeons & Dragons is a portal gun to INFINITE IDEAS and INFINITE POWER without n-n-needing to be a genius like me who built one, Morty. It's not as good as a portal gun, but it's also a lot cheaper and doesn't require unstable energy sources to operate.

>>Dungeon Master (DM): The castle stands among the trees, the crumbling ruins of seven round towers jutting up from it like broken teeth. An archway littered with twisted shards of rusted metal gapes open at the top of a short flight of steps. Two of the towers, speckled with dark arrow slits, loom beside the entryway, and a dark hall yawns beyond.
>>
>>Phillip (cleric): Let's send the rogue up ahead to look in and make sure it's safe.
>>
>>Amy (rogue): OK, I'll move to the side and sneak along the wall of the tower until I can peer in through the entrance.
>>

> What kind of cleric sends somebody in to die for them, anyway? He's totally complicit, Morty. 
>

Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories—a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' actions. Players roll dice to determine whether their attacks hit or miss and whether their characters can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some things more probable than others.

>![[002-ram-head-stern.png|right|300]]
>
>Calculate probabilities all you want, Morty, but don't get caught up in it, because the minute you do, those dice are gonna p-p-punish you, Morty. Fate is a fickle mistress.
>

>>DM: All right, Amy, let's see how sneaky you are. Make a Dexterity check.
>>
>>Amy: With my Stealth skill, right?
>>
>>DM: You bet.
>>
>>Amy (rolling a d20): I'm pretty sneaky—that's a 17.
>>
>>DM: OK, there's no sign that anyone notices you. And you're looking inside?
>>

When you play D&D, you take on the role of an adventurer: a skilled fighter, a devout cleric, a deadly rogue, or a spellcasting wizard. (The character sheets included in this set describe five heroes to get you started.) With some friends and a little imagination, you strike out on grand quests and daring adventures, testing yourself against an array of challenges and bloodthirsty monsters.

One player takes on the role of the Dungeon Master, the game's lead storyteller and referee. The DM is in charge of the adventure, which appears in the adventure book, while the characters navigate the adventure's hazards and decide where to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to a ruined castle, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they boldly stride up to the fallen gate, or try to sneak up in case anyone's watching through those arrow slits? Circle around the castle looking for another entrance? Or cast a spell to cloak themselves in invisibility?

>![[003-ram-head-yas.png|right|300]]
>
>Yeah and no.
>
>Being a Dungeon Master is all that stuff, but it's a lot more than that.
>
>playing d&d is good, but running it is a total power load, morty!
>
>Y-y-you get to be a god, Morty. You control the h-h-horizontal and the vertical. Y-y-ou tell the players what's going on and then you entertain their asses with your brilliance, Morty. You get a little taste of what it's like to be me, all the time. I'm your teacher now. School can't help you here. School is a prison. Ninety-two percent of races in the universe don't even believe in schools—because they know. They already know.
>
>Anyway, the point is, the Dungeon Master is in charge, and since I don't want that balding little turd from the cartoon messing with us again, that means I'm in charge. O-o-or if you're reading this book right now, which you are if you're seeing these words, th-th-then you're in charge! YOU! I totally just deputized you by the power of Greyhawk, or whatever it is.
>

>![[004-c1-03.png|right|300]]
>
>This is a book for new players so they don't want to blow your mind, Morty, but stuff can get wild. Literally, if you can imagine it, it can be in your game!
>
>I'm talking about owlbears, Morty! 
>
>Th-th-that's an owl mixed with a bear! And they lay eggs, Morty! OWLBEAR EGGS! You crack open one of those and a giant beak-faced heap of goop comes out. I-i-it's delicious on toast. You've gotta try it.
>
>Anyway, that's just the tip of iceberg. Take a gander through the Monster Manual sometime and get a glimpse of what these sick designers come up with. It'll blow your mind, Morty.
>

![[005-c1-04.png|right|300]]

The DM determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what the characters experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.

> "UNEXPECTED" i-i-is the key word there, Morty. Your job as the DM is to mess with player expectations. mess them up real good. Set 'em up and then tweak their nipples, Morty. You're not winning until someone cries. It's about the journey, not the destination. 
>

There's no winning and losing in D&D—at least not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create a story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to play a new character. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if the players had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

>![[006-ram-head-daze.png|right|300]]
>
>Th-th-that makes for a nice sales pitch, but it's horse poop, Morty. Life is all about "winners" and "losers." Captain Drama-Pants here doesn't want to admit that when his character dies, he's a loser, but he is.
>
>![[007-ram-head-smile2.png|right|300]]
>
>Lemme make this really clear: THE DUNGEON MASTER IS THE WINNER BY DEFAULT.
>
>B-b-being in charge and messing with your friends makes you top dog, dawg. After that, it comes down to who gets the most phat loot, experience points, and who rolled the best.

>![[008-ram-head-stern.png|right|300]]
>
>I-i-if creating some compelling narrative about your m-m-motivations for saving your brother the Prince of Pituitary who was taken by rabid rust monsters gets your rocks off, well then whoop-de-doo for you, but i-i-in the end it all comes down to POWER and CONTROL. Y-y-you've got it, or you don't.

## Getting Started
If this is your first time playing Dungeons & Dragons, start by reading the rest of this chapter. It tells you the most important rules you need to play the game.

Someone needs to be the Dungeon Master for your first play experience. Since you're reading this, you're a good candidate to be the DM. (If one of your friends knows how to play D&D already, you might want to ask that person to be the DM and help you learn the game.) Once you've read this chapter, take a look at the first few pages of the adventure book. That will help you understand the role of the DM and the basics of a D&D adventure.

>![[009-ram-head-sarcasm.png|right|300]]
>
>Thanks, book. I'm gonna show Morty and everyone else how Dungeon Mastering really works.
>
>D&D RICKTH EDITION takes the b-b-*BURP*-basics and blows them out a demon lord's turdhole.
>

From there, look over the rest of this book. You don't need to memorize everything before your first game, but it helps if you know where to find the rules while you play. Then get familiar with the adventure, and you'll be ready to gather your friends together to play.

Each player chooses one character from the *five options included*. It's up to the players to turn these bare-bones characters into people by giving them names, describing their appearance, and bringing them to life while playing through the adventure. If you have more than five players, it's OK for two players to use the same character, as long as they make the details of the character distinct; one cleric might be a jolly woman named Sefris, while the other is a severe man named Albric.

>Using the same character as someone else is kind of a dick move, but I get it. A non-genius human mind can only handle so many options, and f-f-five is all they put in this box, so go with what you've got, right? It's probably easier to just get rid of one of your friends. ***LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP ARE B-B-*BURP*-BIOLOGICAL BULLS**T*** Also, I might just be editorializing at this point, but who names a character Albric? Use the real name of somebody at the table. What are they gonna do about it? 
>

### Game Dice
![[010-c1-05.png|right|300]]

The game uses polyhedral dice. In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10 (the 0 on the die represents a 10), d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die.

Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling the ten-sided die twice. The first roll gives the tens digit, and the second gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to apply. For example, "3d8 + 5" means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.

>![[011-ram_d20.png|right|300]]
>
>There's only one set in here, so that means they're mine. Get your own dice. That way you can blame them for all your shortcomings. Tell your friends to get their own set, too.
>
>If you start sharing dice, people will start expecting you to share everything. You gotta nip that in the bud, or the next thing you know, you'll wake up in an alley without a kidney.
>
>You can never have too many dice, Morty!
>

![[012-c1-06.png|right|300]]

### The Structure of Play
The D&D game consists of a group of characters (controlled by the players) embarking on an adventure that the DM presents. The adventure is the heart of the game. An adventure unfolds as a story that the DM and the other players tell together using the material in the adventure book, in another published adventure, or in a setting of the DM's creation. The DM sets the scene at the start, giving the adventurers a reason to get involved. They are the protagonists of the story. The players control what they do, and the DM controls the monsters and people the adventurers meet. The DM also decides how the world changes as a result of the adventurers' actions.

>![[013-ram-head-rick-lol.png|right|300]]
>
>Ha-HA! It's right there in the rules, Morty! The DM decides! Suck it, everyone else!
>

Play of an adventure unfolds according to this basic pattern:

#### 1. The DM describes the environment
The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options available: how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the tavern, and so on. The players can ask questions to make sure they understand what their characters perceive.

>![[014-c1-07.png|right|300]]
>
>Don't let players trick you, Morty. Players constantly ask questions as a way to try and make stuff happen that you didn't intend. Are they spending too much time investigating that stupid dark corner in the tavern? Now there's a tentacle monster in it.
>

#### 2. The players describe what they want to do
Sometimes one player speaks for the whole group, saying, "We'll take the east door," for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things. One adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second one examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third one keeps watch for monsters. The players don't need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.

Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.

>Here's an extra tip: if you're the DM, you can roll your dice behind a fancy screen and lie like crazy about the results.
>
>![[015-ram-head-rick-mad.png|right|300]]
>
>Y-y-you don't want to be obvious about it, Morty—like, try to pretend that you actually rolled that number—b-b-but if you want a certain outcome, just lie like crazy.
>
>They can question you about it, and they don't have to like the answers. That's on them.
>

#### 3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions
Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.

This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring an ancient ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.

Often the action of an adventure takes place wholly in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM's verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.

>**Miniatures and maps are fine, j-j-just don't get carried away, Morty. One time I got really drunk and grew actual miniatures of creatures and characters and put 'em in a little dungeon together because I thought it would be more realistic and save time, but**
>
>IT WAS A F***ING DISASTER! 
>
>**The tiny characters whined because they didn't have food and they were starving, and the little monsters just started shedding and barfing everywhere.**
>
>**It was a real mess.**
>

> ##### What's Next?
>This set is a complete Dungeons & Dragons experience, enough to provide hours of play. You can even play through the adventure book multiple times. You might be surprised at how differently things can turn out! But one of the most rewarding things about D&D is that it provides the opportunity to create characters, and even worlds, of your own.

### Halving
Round down whenever the game requires you to halve a number. For example, if you halve 15, you get 7.

## Six Abilities
Six abilities provide a quick game description of every character's and monster's physical and mental characteristics:

- **Strength**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? For each of the six abilities, a character or monster has an **ability score** to measure it, typically ranging from 3 to 18. An adventurer can have a score as high as 20. A monster can have one as high as 30.

The most important function of an ability score is providing an **ability modifier** that usually ranges from −1 (for a score of 8 or 9) to +4 (for a score of 18). This modifier applies to ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls, as explained in the next few sections.

>![[018-ram-rick-talking.png|right|300]]
>
>here's what you really need to know about these abilities, morty:
>
>STRENGTH: How to hit stuff
>
>DEXTERITY: How to keep from being hit by stuff
>
>CONSTITUTION: How to survive getting hit by stuff
>
>INTELLIGENCE: Good for arcane stuff
>
>WISDOM: Finding stuff
>
>CHARISMA: Dump stat, ignore it
>

#### Ability Scores and Modifiers

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---:|
| 1 | −5 | 16–17 | +3 |
| 2–3 | −4 | 18–19 | +4 |
| 4–5 | −3 | 20–21 | +5 |
| 6–7 | −2 | 22–23 | +6 |
| 8–9 | −1 | 24–25 | +7 |
| 10–11 | +0 | 26–27 | +8 |
| 12–13 | +1 | 28–29 | +9 |
| 14–15 | +2 | 30 | +10 |

> Notice how they've got stats there up to 30 even though you can only start with a max of 20? That's there to show you a simple fact of life: S-s-some things are just better than you, Morty. I mean, a lot of things are better than you, but I also mean here in the world of D&D. Anything 8 or lower I call a "blart." It comes from this dimension I found where all numbers less than 9 have the same term: "blart." It means fart. Fart, fart, fart, fart, fart, fart, fart, fart, nine, ten, eleven, you get it. Anyway, blarts stink, Morty. 
>

### The Core Rule
Does an adventurer's sword swing hurt a dragon or bounce off its iron-hard scales? Does the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Does a character avoid the main blast of a fireball or take full damage from the blaze? When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game relies on the roll of a d20 to determine success or failure. Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls. For each one, you roll a d20, add any bonuses or penalties, and compare the total to a target number. If the total equals or exceeds it, you succeed. Here are those steps in more detail:

#### 1. Roll the die
Roll a d20, then add the modifier of the ability score used for the roll. A Dexterity saving throw, for instance, uses your Dexterity modifier.

#### 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties
A spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the roll.

#### 3. Compare the total to a target number
If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the roll is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The target number for an ability check or saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). For an attack roll, it's the Armor Class (AC) of the target being attacked. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.

![[019-c1-08.png|right|300]]

Ability checks are discussed on the following page, saving throws later in this chapter. Attack rolls are described in *chapter 2*.

4. The Dungeon Master is always right.

I-I-I don't know why they didn't include that in their supposed "core rules," but that should actually be number 1. J-j-just scratch out the order of the other stuff and put that at the top.The DM also tells people when they're being stupid.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on a d20 roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one.

>![[020-c1-09.png|right|300]]
>
>Th-th-this ADVANTAGE/DISADVANTAGE thing is perfect to use against annoying players.
>
>If your player Maureen says, "Shouldn't these goblins run away after we killed seventy-two of their pals?" you just look her right in the eye and say, "No, Maureen. They shouldn't. These g-g-goblins are hopped up on gnoll blood they chugged before the battle and now they've got advantage, so how do you like that, Maureeeeen?"
>
>And don't let players turn this back on you either. When Maureen's character Flardo the Fearless tries to chug gnoll blood on his own, you just shake your head and say, "Awwwww nuts, Maureen. That gnoll blood is toxic to dwarves, so now you've got disadvantage on all your rolls, Maureeeeen."
>
>Finger guns optional.
>

### Ability Checks
An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. A character might make a Strength check to force open a door, an Intelligence check to make sense of clues, or a Wisdom check to notice goblins lying in ambush along the road. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. You use your Strength modifier for a Strength check, for example.

If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success. Otherwise, the check is a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.

Often, the adventure book tells the DM what kind of check a character can make, the DC of the check, and what happens if the character succeeds or fails. Since characters often try unpredictable things, though, the adventure book also provides advice to help the DM decide what kind of ability check and DC to use in a particular situation.

>ABILITY CHECKS are another solid way to punish players who question you, Morty.
>
>make them do ability checks for every last little thing until they acknowledge your superiority.
>
>![[021-ram-head-smile2.png|right|300]]
>
>Sorry, Hoyt. You've forgotten how to use your legs, so you'll need to make an Intelligence check to reignite your synapses and remind your limbs how to function.
>
>![[022-ram-head-ehlol.png|right|300]]
>
>Oh, you made it? Cool, cool. How about a Dexterity check to see if enough blood is pumping through those legs to walk straight and avoid traps at the same time?
>
>![[023-ram-head-smile1.png|right|300]]
>
>Did I just say "traps?" Damn straight, Hoyty-toyty. Now make a Wisdom check to see if you notice the razor wire perfectly positioned to cleave Flardo's feet from his ankles.
>
>***ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY F***ING QUESTIONS? DIDN'T THINK SO.***
>

#### Proficiency Bonus
You might be particularly skilled at a certain kind of task related to an ability check. The character sheets list each character's proficiencies with skills and special tools, and the monster statistics in the adventure book show monsters' proficiencies. If you have proficiency in a skill, such as Acrobatics or Deception, you add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make that use that skill. If you have proficiency with a certain tool, such as *thieves' tools*, you add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make using those tools. You never add your proficiency bonus more than once to the same d20 roll.

>![[024-c1-12.png|right|300]]
>
>Th-th-these INCREMENTAL BONUSES don't seem like much, but you've gotta watch out because players will nickel and dime every miniscule bonus they can to try and "win."
>
>Be ready with a penalty or disadvantage any time you need to wipe that smile off their face.
>

#### Contests
Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks.

The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

![[025-c1-11.png|right|300]]

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.

> A good DM knows when to force players to make contested rolls against each other, Morty. You wanna keep the adventuring party from operating too efficiently,  so put 'em in situations where they need to arm wrestle for rations at the campsite or have a drinking contest at dinner with the Duke of Dingleberry. 
>

#### Skills
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and a character's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect.

A Dexterity check might, for example, reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, "Make a Wisdom (Perception) check." At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that use that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the character makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

>Here's a little cutting-edge f***ery you can pull on your players, Morty:
>
>COMBINE THEIR WORST ATTRIBUTE WITH A RANDOM SKILL THAT DOESN'T GO WITH IT
>
>just to mess with their m-m-minds.
>
>![[026-ram-head-smile1.png|right|300]]
>
>"I'd like you to make an Intelligence (Athletics) check."
>
>![[027-ram-mortyface-panic.png|right|300]]

>
>![[028-ram-head-stern.png|right|300]]
>
>"Because mind and body are one, Morty. You have to remember how to swim, and if you don't, you drown."

### Strength Checks
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force. A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

#### Athletics
Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
- You have a real bad day and you gotta slime monster right up your butt, and you g-gotta yank it out, Morty. You gotta brute strength this thing. You can't leave a slime monster in there, Morty. It'll make a nest.

### Dexterity Checks
Dexterity measures physical agility, reflexes, and balance. A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

>![[029-c1-13.jpg|right|300]]
>
>ACROBATICS
>
>D-d-don't let players convince you that they can use Dexterity (Acrobatics) to d-d-dodge attacks or any of that s***. Skills are for non-combat rolls only, dawg.
>
>Players will walk all over you if you let them, Morty. They'll squeeze every last ounce out of the rules if you're not careful. Stay vigilant, or they'll start having a lot of fun.
>

#### Acrobatics
Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

#### Sleight of Hand
Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

>SLEIGHT OF HAND
>
>Stealing is a time-honored D&D tradition, Morty. Rogues do it, obviously, but everyone else does too.
>
>***EVEN CLERICS!***
>
>![[030-ram-head-drunk.png|right|300]]
>
>Don't let that "holy" façade fool you. Th-th-they're just as twisted and misanthropic as everyone else in D&D, they just hide it better. Their religion is just a cover for their fantasy pawn shop.
>
>That's just my opinion, Morty. W-W-Wizards of the Coast doesn't say that anywhere, that's just me.
>

#### Stealth
Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

>![[031-ram-head-rick-lol.png|right|300]]
>
>STEALTH
>
>Sneaking around and stealing is where it's at, so if you wanna be smart like your grandpa, make sure you crank that Dex up, you dig?
>

> ##### Hiding and Vision
>When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
>
>You can't hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can't be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.
>
>***Passive Perception.*** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

>For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, they have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.

>***What Can You See.*** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area—such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In a heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—vision is blocked, effectively imposing the blinded condition, as explained in the appendix.

>![[032-c1-14.png|right|300]]
>
>S-s-sure you can memorize all this if you want: passive blah-blah and how much of a character's ass is sticking out or whatever, but if you wanna do this Rick-style, here's how it goes: roll a d20 behind your DM screen and then—it doesn't matter what the roll was, just look at the players, squint your eyes a bit, and say:
>
>"oops. they spotted you."
>
>BAM-A-LAM! Problem solved. Saves you a lotta trouble, Morty. Gets you to the good stuff.
>

### Constitution Checks
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force. Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.

![[033-ram-head-startled.png|right|300]]

WOW! THEY R-R-REALLY SCRIMPED ON THIS PART, HUH MORTY!

>There are tons of ways to use Constitution checks that these ding-dongs don't want you to know about. They don't have vision like I do, Morty. They don't see the big picture. Here are some great Constitution checks that "push beyond normal limits":
>
>![[034-c1-15.png|right|300]]
>
>- When your character is at a fancy dinner with the Duchess of Dingleberry and suddenly has a monster fart, can they hold it in? You gotta be a hero sometimes, Morty. You might think that's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics), but trust me, Morty, that's p-p-pure Constitution right there.
>- Have you ever got a paper cut in the webby part between your fingers, Morty? It's the most painful thing in the universe. No one can even see it, but it still b-b-*BURP*-burns, Morty. Paper cuts can happen at any moment, and when they do, you've just got to keep it together. The world's a dangerous place, Morty. I can't believe they didn't mention that Constitution's how you keep your s*** locked down.
>- Drinking! Look, I kn-kn-know the D&D people don't want to glorify drinking in a game for 13-year-olds, but y-y-you're 14, Morty. Also, this is the theater of the mind, or whatever, so it's not real drinking—but trust me, you're gonna love that too.

### Intelligence Checks
Intelligence measures mental acuity, strength of recall, and the ability to reason. An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

#### Arcana
Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.

#### History
Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

#### Investigation
When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

#### Nature
Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

#### Religion
Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

>![[035-ram-head-rick-madconfused.png|right|300]]
>
>What the hell is this doing under Intelligence? I've had enough people try to worship me to know religions are a crock, Morty.
>

### Wisdom Checks
Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you, representing perceptiveness and intuition. A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

#### Animal Handling
When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

>![[036-c1-16.png|right|300]]
>
>ANIMAL HANDLING
>
>S-s-some players think they're animal whisperers, Morty. Don't let them befriend animals in your game. It always starts with one wolf or squirrel, then, next thing you know, you're tracking a f***ing MENAGERIE, each one with their own character sheet. N-n-no pets!
>

#### Insight
Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

>INSIGHT
>
>S-s-some players use Insight on everything, Morty. They think they're Sherlock Holmes, analyzing every word they hear, looking for hidden meanings.
>
>There's no meaning to any of this, Morty. Not D&D, not life, nothing. So here's how you deal with this:
>
>Tell them that there's something fishy going on, but refuse to elaborate, no matter how high they roll.
>
>OR 
>
>Grab a random scrap of paper from behind your DM screen and scribble a symbol on it, just seriously anything, then surreptitiously slide it over to them.
>
>![[037-ram-head-rick-lol.png|right|300]]
>
>Don't tell them what it is or answer any other questions. If they roll Wisdom (Insight) again, give 'em another scribble. Another roll. More scraps of garbage. They'll drive themselves insane trying to figure out what it all means. People can't handle secrets, Morty. Their minds are weak.
>

#### Medicine
A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

>![[038-c1-17.png|right|300]]
>
>Medicine
>
>Medieval medicine isn't pretty, Morty. Even in a fantasy world, they don't know jack about germs or pathogens or antib-b-b-*BURP*-biotics.
>

#### Perception
Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

>![[039-ram-head-daze.png|right|300]]
>
>PERCEPTION
>
>That Insight stuff I mentioned earlier goes double for Perception, Morty.
>
>Some players just can't stop staring and listening and sniffing instead of doing. It can't all be that interesting, but they're gonna try anyway.
>

#### Survival
The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

>![[040-c1-18.png|right|300]]
>
>SURVIVAL
>
>If a player really pisses you off, make them roll Wisdom (Survival) for everything:
>
>make their butt cheeks clench in fear every time you look in their direction.
>

### Charisma Checks
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence. A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

#### Deception
Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

#### Intimidation
When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

#### Performance
Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

#### Persuasion
When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

> ##### Finding a Hidden Object
>When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.
>
>In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.
>

### Saving Throws
A saving throw, or save, represents an attempt to resist or avoid a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to do so because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.

A character sheet indicates a character's saving throw proficiencies. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. When a spell allows a saving throw, for instance, the DC for that save is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that forces the save. Usually, a successful save means that a character or monster suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

> This is the core of it, Morty:  FORCE THEM TO JUMP THROUGH POINTLESS HOOPS FOR YOUR OWN ENTERTAINMENT. Some players think they're unt-t-touchable, Morty. This is how you touch them with the finger of God. 
>

# Chapter 2: Combat
Battle often erupts when adventurers face their foes, whether the enemies are savage monsters or cunning villains. This chapter provides the rules you need for such combat. The rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. "You" can also mean the character or monster that you control.

![[042-c2-01.png|right|300]]

>![[043-ram-head-rick-lol2.png|right|300]]
>
>OKAY, MORTY. WE'RE PAST THE BEGINNER S***.
>
>This is where the dice really hit the table, and you get to kick ass or watch your ass get kicked.
>
>Pay close attention, because I'm gonna teach you how to D with some D: die with some dignity.
>

## The Order of Combat
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**.

The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

> Six seconds doesn't sound like much, but life is cheap, Morty. By the time you can count to "six," I could use a tri-laser monofilament to cut a half-dozen Gromflomites into space-kibble. 
>

![[044-c2-02.png|right|300]]

> ##### Combat Step by Step
>**1. Determine surprise**. The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
>
>**2. Establish positions**. The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are—how far away and in what direction.
>
>**3. Roll initiative**. Everyone involved rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.
>
>**4. Take turns**. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
>
>**5. Begin the next round**. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.
>

### Surprise
![[045-c2-03.png|right|300]]

The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.

> Remember before when I mentioned stuff about messing with player expectations? Combat and non-combat surprises are a crucial part of that, Morty. If one of your players is wasting too much time searching for s*** that doesn't matter, or getting weepy about their character's backstory, just yell "SURPRISE!" and drop a random encounter on their asses. 
>

>![[046-ram-head-smile2.png|right|300]]
>
>In fact, here's a SURPRISE Table I j-j-just whipped up that you can use. Roll a d12 and consult the results over here.
>

| d12 | Surprise |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | A ghostly hand appears and slaps a random character for 2d4 bludgeoning damage. If this kills them, they rise as a spectral presence that follows the group, endlessly slapping them as well. |
| 2 | Five **giant rats** burst from the ground and attack. Name them after your favorite boy band. |
| 3 | Every magic potion the party carries has turned to spoiled milk. |
| 4 | Point at the character who last spoke. Their left foot has fallen asleep, causing them to suffer **−**1 Dexterity for an hour. |
| 5 | Two **flameskulls** fly in, accompanied by loud heavy metal music. They attack. |
| 6 | A lone **flameskull** flies in, looking for his two friends who ditched him on the way to a heavy metal concert. He's confused and angry and also attacks. |
| 7 | The party hears a scraping noise coming from the nearby wall. Make it seem important to the story. Use this noise to focus the group and lead them to the next encounter. |
| 8 | A random character vomits up an **ochre jelly**. Describe the burning sensation as it erupts from the character's feeble mouth-hole. Make the party regret ever wasting your time. |
| 9 | A random character's favorite weapon just gained magical intelligence and starts nagging them about getting on with the adventure. |
| 10 | An arrow suddenly shoots out from the shadows and hits the character who is pissing you off. The character takes 1d6 + 4 piercing damage and should reconsider their current course of action. |
| 11 | Something gold and shiny catches the eye of a party member. What is it? Whatever you want. |
| 12 | Pick a random character. Tell them their esophagus is cursed. |

### Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.

>![[047-ram-head-rick-mad.png|right|300]]
>
>This is why Dexterity is so important, Morty. You've gotta be fast to get what you want in life and in D&D.
>
>![[048-c2-04.png|right|300]]
>
>I know jumping in feet-first isn't exactly your strong suit, Morty, but when the chips are down and the stakes are high, you just gotta roll with it!
>
>LIFE'S A TIGHTROPE, MORTY!
>

### Your Turn
On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are described in the "*Actions in Combat*" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

The "*Movement and Position*" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in "*Actions in Combat*."

#### Bonus Actions
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game allows you to do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have one to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take the bonus action during the turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified.

>![[049-c2-05.png|right|300]]
>
>Not that you would ever have this problem, Morty, but deciding on a bonus action is actually pretty tough when you've got the ability to see all possible outcomes in all possible timelines.
>
>![[050-c2-06.png|right|300]]
>
>My favorite bonus action is called "taunting a creature I just killed."
>
>Remind 'em who's boss.
>

#### Other Activity on Your Turn
Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

>![[051-ram-head-sarcasm.png|right|300]]
>
>Time doesn't stop for players' self-indulgent bulls**t here, Morty.
>
>Six seconds per round.
>
>KEEP IT SNAPPY.
>

### Reactions
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

You can take only one reaction per round. When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

>"Reactions" is the technical term and it's okay, I guess, but I prefer the term,
>
>"AW HELL NO, SON!"
>
>![[052-ram-head-rick-madconfused.png|right|300]]
>
>because that's really what it is.
>
>Some evil spellcaster tries to set something off when you're standing right there and you get to say "AW HELL NO, SON!" and do your thing instead.
>
>It's how I try to live my life.
>

## Movement and Position
In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand. On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here. Your move can include jumping, climbing, and swimming, as described in *chapter 3*.

### Breaking Up Your Move
![[053-c2-07.jpg|right|300]]

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed both before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, search for a trap door, and then move 20 feet.

Similarly, if you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks.

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the *fly* spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

>![[054-c2-08.png|right|300]]
>
>This is a terrible example, Morty.
>
>If you got a wizard to cast the fly spell on you, then you should never set your feet on the ground until that spell expires.
>
>WHAT KIND IF A$$HOLE IS GONNA
>
>**WALK**
>
>ANYWHERE WHEN THEY CAN F***ING FLY?!
>
>Waste of a good spell, Morty.
>

### Difficult Terrain
Combatants are often slowed down by difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

>![[055-ram-head-rick-lol.png|right|300]]
>
>Another good example of "difficult terrain?" This right here!
>
>**faaaaaaaaart**
>
>See, if you were flying, you could have avoided that fart.
>

### Being Prone
Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in *appendix A*.

You can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.

### Moving Around Other Creatures
You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if it is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you (creature sizes are detailed in the adventure book). Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you move out of an enemy's reach, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.

![[056-c2-09.png|right|300]]

## Actions in Combat
When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

> ##### Casting a Spell
>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Most spells have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See *chapter 4* for the rules on spellcasting.
>

### Attack
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the "*Making an Attack*" section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature that the fighter gets at 5th level, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

>Just imagine for a second that you're not a 14-year-old weakling with crushing anxiety and low intellect. This is roleplaying, remember? Okay, so imagine that you're cool like your character is supposed to be cool, and then DESCRIBE THE COOL THINGS YOU THINK THEY SHOULD DO.

>Look. Your daily life is a futile merry-go-round of crushing repetition, and every single moment is another tick of the clock that carries you closer to the grave. This game is meant to help you escape that futile reality for just a little while.

>
>Pretend you're cool, roll a big number, paint a gorgeous word-picture, and watch as your friends cheer... over a stupid die roll! It's ridiculous, but it's also kind of beautiful, you know?
>

### Dash
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

### Disengage
If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

>![[058-c2-11.png|right|300]]
>
>"Disengage" is also w-what I do whenever Jerry starts talking.
>
>Just stare at his left eye or right nostril or whatever, and let your eyesight lose focus. Unwrap your mind from the world.
>
>Let his stupid, milquetoast words turn into mush and just...
>
>DISENGAGE
>

### Dodge
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in *appendix A*) or if your speed drops to 0.

### Help
You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

>
>HELP
>
>You want to make this game a living hell, Morty. Make them weep for the help of their comrades as they scramble to keep themselves alive.
>

### Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in *chapter 1* for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "*Unseen Attackers and Targets*" section later in this chapter.

### Ready
Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

A spell must have a casting time of 1 action to be readied, and holding onto the spell's magic until you release it with your reaction requires concentration (explained in *chapter 4*). For example, if you are concentrating on the *web* spell and ready *magic missile*, your *web* spell ends, and if you take damage before you release *magic missile* with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

> READY If a player steps away from a goblin instead of killing it, they're a useless little weasel who deserves what's coming to 'em, Morty. 
>

### Search
When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

### Use an Object
You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

## Making an Attack
Whenever you make an attack roll, you're making an attack. Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has the following structure:

**1. Choose a target**. Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.

**2. Determine modifiers**. The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties, bonuses, advantage, or disadvantage to your attack roll.

2A. Describe your attack in a cool way. Why are you even playing this game if you're just going to be your normal, boring-ass self?

**3. Resolve the attack**. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack specifies otherwise.

3A.Curse your luck. When you roll like s***, and trust me, you will sometimes, curse the polyhedron gods who look down and laugh at your misery. We all do it when the dice go to hell. This time, it's your turn. But lucky for you, this is a great time to use those fancy cuss words you learned online.

### Attack Rolls
![[060-c2-12.png|right|300]]

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. Each character's AC is shown on the character sheet, and each monster's AC is in the monster's stat block.

#### Modifiers to the Roll
When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. A monster uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

***Ability Modifier.*** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The cleric uses Wisdom when making a melee or ranged spell attack, and the wizard uses Intelligence.

***Proficiency Bonus.*** If you are proficient with the weapon you are attacking with, you can add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

When you make a spell attack, you add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

Hidden Bonus. If no one is looking, add something like +1 or +3 to your roll—depending on how much you think you can get away with. Never pull this when I'm the DM, though. If I catch you cheating, I'll saw your hands off and attach them to your butt so you clap every time you fart.

#### Rolling 1 or 20
Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit or the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.

>![[061-c2-13.png|right|300]]
>
>Rolling a natural 20 is always exciting, Morty.
>
>Yes, it's just one number out of twenty and it shouldn't be a big deal, but it feels awesome.
>
>Lord your randomly-generated superiority over everyone else.
>
>Take a photo of it and send it to your mom.
>

### Unseen Attackers and Targets

>![[062-c2-14.png|right|300]]
>
>I know you like rogues, Morty. Just remember they're not meat-shields. Rogues gotta do it fart-style...
>
>SILENT BUT DEADLY.
>

Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the *invisibility* spell, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.

If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

### Ranged Attacks
![[063-c2-15.png|right|300]]

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.

#### Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.

> I'm with Wizards of the Coast on this one, Morty. Anybody trying to shoot an arrow at a dude less than 5 feet away deserves disadvantage. This is why we invented swords. 
>

### Melee Attacks
Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them. Certain creatures (typically those larger than a human) have greater reach, as noted in their descriptions.

You can make a melee attack without a weapon by making an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-butt, or other forceful blow. You add your proficiency bonus and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, it deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier.

>![[064-ram-head-smile1.png|right|300]]
>
>In real life, it can be fun to punch someone in the squishy bits or jam an elbow in their eye, but not in D&D.

>
>![[067-ram-head-hmph.png|right|300]]
>
>It's boring and stupid.
>
>***JUST USE A DAMN WEAPON OR A SPELL.***
>

### Opportunity Attacks
In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before it leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

>![[068-ram-head-ehlol.png|right|300]]
>
>Good advice. If you ever need to retreat from combat, make sure you do it by RIDING AN EXPLOSION.
>

### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you gain a bonus action you can use to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

## Cover

>![[069-c2-16.png|right|300]]
>
>If you're looking for cover in the middle of a particularly nasty combat, you need to get creative, Morty.
>

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

>![[070-ram-head-confused.png|right|300]]
>
>I had a magic-user back in the day named Alakazaar. (Yeah, we used to call wizards "magic-users," which is weird, I know. We don't call fighters "weapon-users.")

>
>Alakazaar wasn't allowed to wear armor, but there was no rule stopping him from hiding behind a bunch of dead bodies that happened to be wearing armor themselves. It's a little loophole there that most people don't think about.

>When things are going bad and you need a barrier between you and a half-dozen flaming arrows, hug a corpse, Morty.

## Damage and Healing
Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore the worlds of D&D.

> "Constant companions" makes it sound all sweet, like it's no big deal that this game has a stat for how alive you are. That's dark as f***, Morty. 
>

### Hit Points
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points), can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

>![[072-c2-17.png|right|300]]
>
>Clarification: Low hit points have no physical effect on a creature's capabilities, but they sure as hell cause mental damage to players, Morty!
>
>All their ambitions hang on their flimsy HP, and the Dungeon Master can yank on that little choke chain any time they want.
>

### Damage Rolls
Each weapon and spell notes the damage it deals on a successful attack. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. In addition, certain special abilities give extra damage represented by bonus dice.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.

>![[073-c2-18.png|right|300]]
>
>Sometimes I'll just silently stare at the players and keep rolling damage dice, over and over, until they beg me to just get it over with and kill their characters.
>
>That's a D&D Rickth Edition p-p-power move, Morty.
>

#### Critical Hits
When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

>
>***CRITICAL FAIL***
>
>Notice that there aren't any critical fails here in the rules. That's because the math is completely ridiculous.

>You roll a d20 over and over each session, so if 5 percent of the time it caused a lethally stupid mistake, you'd be dead faster than Jerry's sex drive.
>
>BUT-
>
>If you're the DM and want your players to go to brown town in their shorts, tell them that a specific roll you just assigned them has a Critical Fail Condition, which I pronounce "CuFuC."
>
>Tell them that getting a 1 on this particular roll is the worst possible thing they could ever do.
>
>Then, on the rare occasion it actually happens, roll a d12 and consult this special Critical Fail Table I put together just for you:
>

CRITICAL FAIL CONDITION TABLE

| d12 | CuFuC |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | If you made this roll during an attack, you just hit a random character with double critical damage instead. If this roll was non-combat, you're so angry at f***ing up that you attack a random character with your primary weapon in frustration. |
| 2 | Give the die that made this roll to another player at the table. They must use this die for the rest of the game session and, every time they roll it, they have to say "Bad, die. BAD!" |
| 3 | All your hair falls out. Yes, even down there... |
| 4 | All your magic items have turned into nonmagical versions of the same stuff. |
| 5 | Roll twice on the SURPRISE table from earlier in this chapter. |
| 6 | You take 1d12 force damage. Describe in excruciating detail what you did to earn this embarrassing injury. |
| 7 | You get a paper cut. If you fail a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, you lose 1d6 hit points from blood loss at the start of each of your turns for the next 1d6 rounds. |
| 8 | The weapon or item you were using when you made this crappy roll catches on fire. Throw it away or take 2d10 fire damage while it smolders. |
| 9 | Whatever you were doing when this roll took place just became a comedic pratfall that hits you in the junk. Take 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and if you had a point of Inspiration, it's now gone. |
| 10 | You are so angry at your stupid mistake that an important grouping of blood vessels in your brain bursts. Permanently lose 1 Intelligence and your sense of smell. |
| 11 | Your roll was so bad that you forsake the gods. If you're a cleric you poop yourself every time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest. |
| 12 | Your internal organs are replaced with stinging bees. Instant death. No saving throw. |

#### Damage Types
Different attacks and damaging spells deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The types are acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, and thunder.

> D&D Rickth Edition has a new d-d-damage type I just came up with, Morty. 
>

![[075-c2-20.png|right|300]]

>![[076-c2-21.png|right|300]]
>
>No saving throw.
>
>No resistance.
>
>Hits the character right in b-b-*BURP*-breadbasket and makes 'em fold over like Jerry after realizing his marriage was a meaningless sham.
>
>*Hilarious*
>

### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

>![[077-ram-head-rick-lol.png|right|300]]
>
>Like I said before, Shut Up damage has no resistance, so apply liberally.
>

### Healing
Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent, and even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (as explained in *chapter 3*), and magical methods such as a *cure wounds* spell or a *potion of healing* can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic, such as a *revivify* spell, has restored it to life.

>this here is why D&D is so great, morty.
>
>Damage is an abstraction.
>
>![[078-c2-22.png|right|300]]

>It's all just those little HP numbers goin' up and down, up and down.

>Y-y-y-you don't have to worry about pulling groin muscles, or plugged sinuses, or cranial deterioration from experimenting on your own b-b-brain, or liver damage from the drinking, o-o-or the emotional toil on your soul from abandoning your family multiple times across infinite dimensions... it's... it's just a number.
>
>Just a little number.
>

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.

#### Instant Death
Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

>Death just happens, Morty. The whole thing is just cells changing states. Composing and decomposing. Over and over.

>
>A god your mom created—and I created your mom, so what does that make me, Morty?!
>
>I'm your grandgod, Morty!
>

#### Falling Unconscious
If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see *appendix A*). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

>![[082-c2-23.png|right|300]]
>
>And th-th-that's why you gotta be NUMB... numb to the universe 'cause it's numb to you... numb... num... number one! 
>
>We're number one, Morty!
>
>Nuuuuummber ooo-*BURP*-oone!
>

#### Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.

***Rolling 1 or 20.*** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

***Damage at 0 Hit Points.*** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

#### Stabilizing a Creature
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A **stable** creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

### Knocking a Creature Out
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

# Chapter 3: Adventuring
Whether delving into a dungeon, trekking through wilderness, or navigating a teeming city, adventurers need rest, and they seek advancement and gear. This chapter gives rules for travel and resting, describes rewards, and details equipment that might help the characters survive.

## Travel
![[090-c3-02.png|right|300]]

Over the course of an adventure, the characters might travel across wide areas, on trips that could take days. The DM can usually summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You travel through the forest and find the old ruin late in the evening of the third day." Characters can walk about 24 miles in a day.

I call it "Saddle Talk," the transitional story bulls**t that happens in between combat, XP calculation, and loot hoarding.

Give your players some Saddle Talk time and they can pretend they're doing their own super-angsty cable show drama while you prep the next encounter.

Don't go overboard, though, or you'll hear about how "our game should totally be a movie" for the rest of your life.

### Marching Order
The adventurers should establish a marching order. A character might occupy the front rank, a middle rank, or the back rank. The characters in the front and back rank are keeping watch for danger, while those in the middle might be making a map, navigating, or gathering food for the characters to eat when they make camp. If the group encounters monsters or other threats, it's important for the DM to know where each character is located.

>Smart adventuring parties put their weakest members in the middle so they're protected on all sides, Morty, but their mistake is even being weak at all!

>D-d-don't let 'em get complacent on marching order, Morty.
>
>Ask them where they are and make 'em paranoid about who goes where. P-p-paranoia is important to the D&D Rickth Edition experience.
>

### Special Forms of Movement
A journey overland or through a dungeon often requires an adventurer to jump, climb, or swim.

#### Long Jumps
When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump farther than you normally can.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance). Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.

#### High Jumps
When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.

#### Climbing and Swimming
While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

>Th-th-this is how nerds get their exercise, Morty. They roll dice and pretend they're super fit, running and jumping and s***.
>
>All those atrophying muscles and brittle bones housed in your flesh sack are gonna be replaced by cybernetics anyway, Morty. It's all replaceable. Don't even worry about it.
>

## Resting
Heroic as they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.

>RESTING!?
>
>![[093-c3-03.png|right|300]]
>
>Don't let 'em sleep at all! You can't f*** with characters as much if they're rested up, Morty!
>
>You've gotta keep 'em trudging forward all the time, paranoid and near death. That's what D&D is all about!
>
>Heroes going into a hole full of monsters in a kill-or-be-killed quest for glory!
>
>resting is bulls***!
>
>Look at me! I've never slept a day in my life!
>

### Short Rest
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice during a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level (the character sheets show each adventurer's Hit Dice). For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

### Long Rest
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the character must begin the rest again to benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

## Rewards
LOOT

As characters adventure and overcome challenges, they're rewarded for their efforts by the treasure they find and the experience they earn.

A monster's lair might contain a chest of coins, and a goblin raider might carry some of its ill-gotten gains. As characters acquire treasure, they can divide it as they see fit (dividing it equally among all the characters in the party is standard practice), and they can spend it on improved equipment or other supplies.

>![[096-c3-04.png|right|300]]
>
>w-w-we're all hopeless power addicts, morty.
>
>People need to be rewarded in their hedonistic hamster wheels to keep themselves entertained... and that's okay!
>
>Kill critters and get paid, dawg!
>

Experience points (XP) are an abstract measurement of a character's learning and growth in the game. As characters progress through an adventure, they receive XP when they defeat monsters, complete milestones, and overcome other challenges. An XP award for the party is divided equally among the characters.

| Experience Points | Level | Proficiency Bonus |
|:---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 1 | +2 |
| 300 | 2 | +2 |
| 900 | 3 | +2 |
| 2,700 | 4 | +2 |
| 6,500 | 5 | +3 |

>![[097-ram-head-daze.png|right|300]]
>
>Leveling up is like free cable, Morty. Tweaking those little statistics and writing out loot on your character sheet... it's one of the only times you'll feel like you have any worth.
>
>Don't deny yourself this pleasure, Morty. Do deny yourself the pleasures I hear you enjoying in your room, though. And seriously, you gotta hydrate, man.
>

Once a character reaches a specified experience point total, he or she advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level; a character goes from 1st level to 2nd level, and so on up to 20th level (this set goes to 5th level). Upon gaining a level, a character gains additional hit points and class features, as shown on the character sheets included in this set.

> ##### Coinage
>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).
>
>One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars.
>
>Unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
>
>A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.
>

> Electrum has no electricity in it, Morty. I checked. It won't make your balls tingle or anything. I checked that too. Twice. 
>

## Equipment
Proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dangerous environment such as an ancient dungeon or untamed wilderness. Armor and weapons are essential in combat, and a variety of other tools and supplies are useful for exploring dungeons, ruins, and the wilds. This section describes the equipment that the characters have when they start the adventure and additional items they can buy with the treasure they acquire along the way.

>![[099-ram-head-rick-eh.png|right|300]]
>
>Equipment that doesn't give you any combat or statistical advantage is as useless as three shleems on a plumbus, Morty.
>

### Carrying Capacity
A character's Strength score determines the maximum weight the character can carry and still move, provided that the weight is distributed across the body. Multiply a character's Strength by 15 to determine the weight (in pounds) that the character can carry. A character carrying more than this weight has a speed of 0.

> Old school D&D measured everything compared to the weight of coins 'cause they knew that's all anyone gave a s*** about. *And it still is.* You can't escape the power of coinage, Morty. 
>

## Armor and Shields
Adventurers have access to a wide range of armor types. Armor falls into three categories in the game: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.

The adventurers presented on *the character sheets* are already equipped with armor, and each character's Armor Class is calculated using the information in this chapter. You can use this information to upgrade your character's armor as you acquire treasure.

>![[100-ram-head-stern-flip.png|right|300]]
>
>Back in my day we had THAC0, Morty. It was honestly crazy, but I loved it. You really don't want me to try to explain it, though.
>

### Armor Proficiency
Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient with the armor know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class determines what types of armor you have proficiency with: the fighter and cleric can wear any armor and use shields, the rogue is limited to light armor, and the wizard isn't proficient with any armor or shields at all. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

>![[101-c3-06.png|right|300]]
>
>It's how they try and keep the Magic Man down. O-o-once you start leveling up as a wizard, you'll find ways around that little hurdle, and then you're unstoppable.
>

### Light Armor
Light armor is favored by rogues because it lets them make the best use of their Dexterity and doesn't interfere with stealthy movement. When you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the number shown on the table to determine your Armor Class.

| Armor | Cost | Armor Class (AC) | Weight |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|
| Leather | 10 gp | 11* | 10 lb. |
| Studded leather | 45 gp | 12* | 13 lb. |
*You add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class when you wear this armor.
**Leather** armor consists of chest and shoulder protectors made of stiffened leather, with lighter and more flexible protection for the rest of the body. **Studded leather** is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.

### Medium Armor
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. When you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the number shown on the table to determine your Armor Class. If your Dexterity is 16 or higher, you still add only 2.

| Armor | Cost | Armor Class (AC) | Weight |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|
| Hide | 10 gp | 12** | 12 lb. |
| Chain shirt | 50 gp | 13** | 20 lb. |
| Scale mail | 50 gp | 14** | 45 lb. |
| Breastplate | 400 gp | 14** | 20 lb. |
**You add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to your Armor Class when you wear this armor.
**Hide** is a crude armor made from thick furs and pelts. A **chain shirt** is made from interlocking metal rings and commonly worn under clothing. **Scale mail** consists of a leather coat and leggings covered with overlapping scales of metal. You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while wearing scale mail. A **breastplate** is a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather.

### Heavy Armor
Heavy armor offers the best protection, and it requires extensive training to master. The fighter and the cleric are proficient with it. When you wear heavy armor, you don't apply your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class. You also have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

| Armor | Cost | Armor Class (AC) | Weight |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|
| Ring mail | 30 gp | 14 | 40 lb. |
| Chain mail | 75 gp | 16 | 55 lb. |
| Splint | 200 gp | 17 | 60 lb. |

**Ring mail** is leather with heavy rings sewn into it. **Chain mail** is made of interlocking metal rings worn over a layer of quilted fabric. If your Strength is lower than 13, your speed is reduced by 10 feet while you wear chain mail. **Splint** armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. If your Strength is lower than 15, your speed is reduced by 10 feet while you wear splint armor.

### Shields
A shield, made from wood or metal, is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

| Armor | Cost | Armor Class (AC) | Weight |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|
| Shield | 10 gp | +2 | 6 lb. |

>![[102-ram-head-hmph.png|right|300]]
>
>If a player comes up with a "creative" reason why they should get two shield bonuses, I just double the damage I deal them.
>
>Whatever, they won't know.
>

## Weapons
The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the worlds of D&D, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

>![[103-c3-07.jpg|right|300]]
>
>When you describe your morningstar s-s-smashing an orc in the face, that's totally sweet.
>
>Nobody wants to hear about your stupid darts. Nobody names darts.
>
>THEY NAME SWORDS.
>

### Weapon Proficiency
Your class grants you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two main categories are **simple** and **martial**. Certain races, such as the elf race, also grant weapon proficiencies. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon.

>The secret third category of weaponry is the marital weapon. It's a ball and chain, Morty!
>
>![[104-c3-08.png|right|300]]
>
>Sounds cool, right?
>
>WRONG!
>
>Love is a sham. Just fulfill your b-b-b-*BURP*-base biological needs and then move on.
>
>Never get t-t-tied down. Then you can be just like your grandpa, who has everything allllll figured out.
>

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

***Ammunition.*** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

If you employ such a weapon to make a melee attack, you use the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "*Improvised Weapons*" later in the chapter).

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both.

***Heavy.*** Small or Tiny creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See the rules for two-weapon fighting in *chapter 2*.

***Loading.*** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use your action or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

***Range.*** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand: a broken bottle, a table leg, a frying pan, or a wagon wheel. Most combatants are not proficient with such objects as weapons. In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the DM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). This is also the amount of damage dealt by a ranged weapon used as a melee weapon and by a melee weapon that lacks a range but is thrown. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

***Healer's Kit.*** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

![[110-c3-10.png|right|300]]

***Holy Symbol.*** A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be a silver amulet depicting a symbol commonly used to represent a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. The cleric can use a holy symbol to replace the material components of spells, except for those components that have a specific cost. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it emblazoned on a shield. See *chapter 4* for more about spellcasting.

***Lantern, Bullseye.*** A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

***Lantern, Hooded.*** A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

***Lock.*** A creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Better locks are available for higher prices.

***Oil.*** As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

***Playing Cards.*** If you are proficient with playing cards, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with them.

***Potion of Healing.*** A character who drinks the magic, red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.

***Rations.*** Compact, dry foods suitable for extended travel, rations include jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

***Rope.*** Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.

***Spellbook.*** Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.

>
>You don't want a spellbook, Morty—trust me.
>
>Throw it on a USB so it's easier to keister in your butt of holding.
>

***Thieves' Tools.*** This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks.

***Tinderbox.*** This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

![[113-c3-15.png|right|300]]

***Torch.*** A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

# Chapter 4: Spellcasting
Magic permeates the worlds of D&D and most often appears in the form of a spell. This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Clerics and wizards have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.

## What Is a Spell?
A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see *appendix A*), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.

>
>Read all that and then explain to me how an axe-wielding mouth breather is gonna keep up with ME.
>
>Do you see a section in this book about fighter powers? You suuuure don't.
>

### Spell Level
Every spell in this set has a level from 0 to 3. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) *magic missile* at 1st level and the devastating *fireball* at 3rd. (Spells of higher levels, up to 9th, exist in the world but aren't included in this set.) Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 5th level, not 3rd level, to cast a 3rd-level spell.

### Known and Prepared Spells
Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind. Clerics and wizards undergo a process of preparing spells. The number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time is shown on the character sheets.

A character can change this list of prepared spells upon finishing a long rest (see *chapter 3*). Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent in meditation or study: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on the list.

>![[119-ram-head-stern-flip.png|right|300]]
>
>PREPARED SPELLS?!
>
>This is a feeble attempt to try and impose some kind of cap on wizardly supremacy.
>
>If I'm ever a player at your table, you can ignore these limits. They're unnecessary.
>

### Spell Slots
Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, the character sheet for a spellcaster includes how many spell slots of each level the character can use at each character level. For example, at 3rd level, the wizard has four 1st-level slots and two 2nd-level slots.

When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively "filling" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 3rd-level spell fits only in a slot that is at least 3rd level. So when the wizard casts *magic missile*, a 1st-level spell, he or she spends a 1st-level slot and has three remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.

Some monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots.

>![[120-c4-02.jpg|right|300]]
>
>I'm not gonna let some dweeb ruin my game by thinking outside the box and being clever with his powers.
>
>So I watch spellcasters like you watch those women on the shampoo commercials.
>

#### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a wizard casts *magic missile* using a 2nd-level slot, that *magic missile* is 2nd level. The spell effectively expands to fill the slot.

Some spells, such as *magic missile* and *cure wounds*, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in the spell's description.

### Cantrips
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0.

>![[121-ram-head-yas.png|right|300]]
>
>Don't let that "zero" throw you, Morty.
>
>In this case,
>
>zero makes the hero.

>
>These little spells can pack a lotta punch, and the right application of cantrippery can convince peasants and other small-brained creatures that you're Doctor Badass.
>

### Rituals
Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, and it doesn't expend a spell slot.

A cleric or a wizard can cast a spell as a ritual if the spell has the ritual tag. The cleric must also have the spell prepared, while the wizard need only have the spell in his or her spellbook.

![[123-c4-03.png|right|300]]

> ##### Casting in Armor
>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.
>

## Casting a Spell
When a character casts any spell, the rules here apply, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.

Each spell description in this chapter begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.

### Casting Time
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time.

#### Bonus Action
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.

#### Reactions
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.

#### Longer Casting Times
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see "*Concentration*" later in this chapter). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.

### Range
The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like *magic missile*, the target is a creature. For a spell like *fireball*, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch.

Other spells, such as the *shield* spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you (see "*Areas of Effect*" later in the this chapter).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.

>![[124-ram-head-rick-lol.png|right|300]]
>
>a hot protip here:
>
>Just memorize the range of every spell and, when you fight other spellcasters, plant yourself 5 feet or so beyond their max casting range—then show 'em your asssss.
>

### Components
A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.

#### Verbal (V)
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the *silence* spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.

> (V) The rules don't actually say what specific words you have to speak for a verbal component, so I just say whatever comes to mind or power up a filthy insult and let 'er rip. 
>

![[125-c4-04.png|right|300]]

#### Somatic (S)
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.

> (S) Again, they don't specify what magical moves are required, so get Schwifty and s***. Make your spellcasting signature move so hot that monsters beg to join your side before you blast 'em into Experience Particles. 
>

#### Material (M)
Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A component pouch includes all the needed material components to cast spells, except those that have a gold piece cost shown in the spell. A cleric's holy symbol replaces material components, again excepting those with a gold piece cost. If a cost is indicated, a character must purchase that specific component before casting the spell in question.

If a spell specifies that the material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these components, but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.

> (M) NO ONE IS KEEPING TRACK OF PINCHES OF DUST AND CLUMPS OF MOSS. Don't be that guy, Morty. The Dungeon Master will tell you when a spell's got ingredients worth shelling out for. The rest is just doing cool hand symbols and saying BLADOWIE! (see below). 
>

![[126-c4-05.png|right|300]]

### Duration
A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. A spell might specify that its effects last until the spell is dispelled or the effects are destroyed.

#### Instantaneous
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

>![[127-ram-head-daze.png|right|300]]
>
>According to your mother, this duration is also known as "jerry in bed."
>
>Yeah, I didn't want that visual either, Morty. Sucks for us.
>

#### Concentration
Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.
- **Taking damage**. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated (as explained in *appendix A*) or if you die.

### Targets
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).

#### A Clear Path to the Target
To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself
If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.

### Areas of Effect
Spells such as *burning hands* and *fireball* cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of four different shapes: cone, cube, line, or sphere (each illustrated on the DM screen). Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.

A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover, as explained in *chapter 2*.

The point of origin of an area of effect isn't included in the area, unless the area is a sphere.

#### Cone
A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.

#### Cube
You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.

#### Line
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

#### Sphere
You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

>![[128-ram-head-ehlol.png|right|300]]
>
>D-d-don't feel like you've gotta be limited to thosekiddie block shapes for your spell effects, Morty.
>
>When I'm the Dungeon Master and bad guys are launching loads of murder magic, I'll just dump chips or hock a big loogie on the battle map to figure out where the spell hits.
>

### Saving Throws
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. This number is on the character sheets for the cleric and the wizard, and in the statistics for a monster that casts spells.

### Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated (see *chapter 2*).

### Combining Magical Effects
The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two clerics cast *bless* on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.

> ##### Schools of Magic
>Scholars who study the workings of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. The schools help describe spells; the schools have no game rules of their own.
>
>**Abjuration** spells are protective, often creating barriers or warding off trespassers. **Conjuration** spells transport objects or creatures from one location to another. **Divination** spells reveal glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, or visions of distant people or places. **Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. **Evocation** spells tap mystical sources of energy to create a variety of effects, including blasts of fire and channeling positive energy to heal wounds. **Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. **Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. **Transmutation** spells change the properties or physical form of a creature or object.

## Spells
Presented in alphabetical order, these spells are used by characters and monsters in this set.

Some of the spells cause **conditions**, including charmed, deafened, frightened, invisible, paralyzed, prone, restrained, and unconscious. Consult *appendix A* to learn a condition's effects in the game.

### Aid
*2nd-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)
- **Duration**: 8 hours

Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target's hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.

Pure Jerry spell! Why help other people when you could jack yourself up with magic and kick more ass?!

### Augury
*2nd-level divination (ritual*)

- **Casting Time**: 1 minute
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:

- *Weal*, for good results
- *Woe*, for bad results
- *Weal and woe*, for both good and bad results
- *Nothing*, for results that are not especially good or bad

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a false reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

This is for theater majors and Jerrys. Don't worry about divining the future when you play D&D, Morty. The story will find you when you start killing.

### Beacon of Hope
*3rd-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell bestows hope and vitality. Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on Wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit points possible from any healing.

Jerry spell in full effect! Don't waste your spell slots helping other people! You know what'll help them even more? If you kill the creatures attacking everyone!

### Bless
*1st-level enchantment*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

Almost a Jerry spell, but at least you can pump up a bunch of people so they can kill s*** better.

### Blur
*2nd-level illusion*

![[131-c4-08.png|right|300]]

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.

If I wanna see blurry, shifting, wavering people in front of me, I'll just keep drinking.

### Burning Hands
*1st-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Self (15-foot cone)
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

>"Sheet of Flames" sounds like a heavy metal concept album.
>
>I dig it.
>

### Charm Person
*1st-level enchantment*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 hour

You attempt to charm a humanoid you choose within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

Jerry needs this spell just to make friends.

If you really wanna charm someone, do what everyone else does—get rich and buy their loyalty.

### Command
*1st-level enchantment*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: 1 round

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target is prevented from following your command, the spell ends.

***Approach.*** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

***Drop.*** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

***Flee.*** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

***Grovel.*** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

***Halt.*** The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

![[133-c4-09.jpg|right|300]]

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

As much as forcing people to grovel amuses me, it's easier to make 'em fear you by lighting all their s*** on fire.

Save your spell slots, Morty.

### Comprehend Languages
*1st-level divination (ritual*)

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)
- **Duration**: 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of spoken language that you hear. You also understand written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell does not decode secret messages in a text or any glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language.

The only language you need to know in D&D is the language of violence, Morty.

Everyone speaks it and translations are crystal clear. Jerrys want to talk through a battle or "parlay" their asses out of conflict. Never do that.

### Cure Wounds
*1st-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

It's a necessary evil. When you get hurt, you gotta get healed. I recommend not getting hurt.

### Dancing Lights
*Evocation cantrip*

![[134-c4-10.png|right|300]]

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

Pure Jerry. This is life or death combat, not a f***ing rave.

### Darkness
*2nd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and no nonmagical light can illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that is not being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the entire area of light is dispelled.

Not as good as blasting monsters, but it has its place. Getting the drop on some sucker and gutting 'em is pretty sweet.

### Detect Magic
*1st-level divination (ritual*)

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

Anything that helps you find more magic loot is fine by me.

### Dispel Magic
*3rd-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

>![[135-ram-head-rick-madconfused.png|right|300]]

>Why would I waste a spell slot to just get rid of someone else's spell?
>
>That's so stupid!
>
>Abjuration is the worst, Morty. I-i-it's so Jerry.
>

### Feather Fall
*1st-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, M (a small feather or piece of down)
- **Duration**: 1 minute

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.

Wanna freak people out? Jump off an airship, and while everyone's screaming, "He's gonna die!", cast this little number after you pass through a cloud.

You'll float safely to the ground, while those suckers are tearily planning your funeral.

### Fireball
*3rd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 150 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

If you're a wizard and don't take this when it comes available, then just eat your own character sheet.

This is the classic pyro-bomb and it's beautiful, Morty. Chuck this into a room of monsters and get out the marshmallows.

### Flaming Sphere
*2nd-level conjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

This is fireball's slightly stunted younger brother, Morty. That said, there is something viscerally satisfying about rolling a ball of fire around over a bunch of a-holes.

### Fly
*3rd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

>Peeing on your opponents from above is a top shelf move.

### Guidance
*Divination cantrip*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.

If you need this spell to make your ability check, maybe you just shouldn't do that thing you're doing? Stay in your lane, Jerry.

### Guiding Bolt
*1st-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 round

A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

Awwww yeah, God Bolt. Give 'em that radiant damage where the sun don't shine.

### Healing Word
*1st-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

A creature of your choice within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

You can just utter a word to yourself and you feel quantifiably better, Morty! Your life's essence goes back up! Who needs a long rest!

### Hold Person
*2nd-level enchantment*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a small, straight piece of iron)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a humanoid within range that you can see. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

Stopping some dingus in their tracks is aight. Not as cool as lighting them on fire, but maybe that's step two.

### Identify
*1st-level divination (ritual*)

- **Casting Time**: 1 minute
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

Learning what magic loot you just pulled off the corpses of your vanquished foes is a worthwhile investment.

### Inflict Wounds
*1st-level necromancy*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

"Necrotic damage" is a classy way of saying "your taint just rotted off."

### Invisibility
*2nd-level illusion*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends early for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

Drop eldritch vengeance on your enemies and then VORP right outta sight. Classic.

### Lesser Restoration
![[137-c4-11.png|right|300]]

*2nd-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

>![[138-ram-head-dafuq.png|right|300]]
>
>The world of D&D is a dirty place, Morty. Th-th-they don't have body wash or tetanus shots or even tweezers. It's disgusting when you think about it.
>
>They should just call this spell "Magic Soap."
>

### Light
*Evocation cantrip*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)
- **Duration**: 1 hour

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like, and covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends early if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

When you're going down in a dirty hole to kill monsters, it's kinda useful to be able to see where the f*** they are.

### Lightning Bolt
![[139-c4-12.png|right|300]]

*3rd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Self (100-foot line)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

If you're stupid and didn't pick up fireball, then you better grab this. Zap, Crackle, Pop, b*****s!

### Mage Armor
*1st-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)
- **Duration**: 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends early if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

>![[140-ram-head-sarcasm.png|right|300]]
>
>Abjuration is usually garbage, but since wizards are forced to walk around wearing toilet paper for protection because Wizards of the Coast thinks they're OP, this spell might actually keep you alive.
>

### Mage Hand
*Conjuration cantrip*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 minute

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

Push stuff around.

Trigger a trap from a safe distance.

Mess with your friends.

Pick your horse's nose while riding said horse.

I-I can keep going.

### Magic Missile
*1st-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice within range that you can see. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.

Notice this spell's most important feature, Morty: NO ATTACK ROLL.

It hits and hurts. Simple-dimple. Little glowing arrows of death at your command, and nobody can do s*** about it.

### Mass Healing Word
*3rd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures you choose within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

Smart clerics hold this spell in reserve until their party members pay up. These heals don't come cheap.

### Misty Step
*2nd-level conjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

>![[141-ram-head-smile2.png|right|300]]
>
>Perfect for ripping a big nasty fart and then moving elsewhere for maximum deniability.
>

### Prayer of Healing
*2nd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 10 minutes
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

Up to six creatures of your choice within range each regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

That 10-minute casting time is a buzzkill, but when your crew's doing the downtime thing, it gives you something to occupy yourself with so you don't have to participate in their campfire bonding rituals.

### Prestidigitation
*Transmutation cantrip*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 10 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Up to 1 hour

This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

- Create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
- Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- Instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
- Chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
- Make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
- Create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

I bet at first glance you figured I'd call this as a Jerry spell, but it's not, Morty. Prestidigitation is awesome! It doesn't take up any spell slots because it's a cantrip. That means you can use it constantly... and you should.

Everywhere your wizard goes, they'll have glittering teeth, musky magic cologne, a warming glow, and their own personal soundtrack. Clean clothes, too. The other members of your party are gonna shamble into town smelling like ass while you get to be Slick McDick, Wizard Supreme.

### Protection from Energy
*3rd-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

Don't waste third level spell slots on protecto-trash. Kill your enemies fast and you won't even need defense.

### Ray of Frost
*Evocation cantrip*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

This is it, Morty, the third of the holy triumvirate of low-level wizard DPS. It's a song of ice and fire AND lightning.

### Resistance
*Abjuration cantrip*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a miniature cloak)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.

>![[142-ram-head-rick-smile-flip.png|right|300]]
>
>Wait, the material component for this is "a miniature cloak"?
>
>Who the f*** is running around with a pouch full of miniature cloaks?
>
>Wizards of the Coast, whatever you're smoking, I want some.
>

### Revivify
*3rd-level necromancy*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which are consumed when the spell is cast)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell cannot return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

>![[143-ram-head-meh.png|right|300]]
>
>Calling the spell "Have you tried not dying?" would be more accurate, but not as catchy.
>

### Sacred Flame
*Evocation cantrip*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

Flame-like radiance descends on a creature within range that you can see. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Not bad, but radiant damage means your enemy's clothes don't catch on fire, so it's not as funny.

### Sanctuary
*1st-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends early.

Don't worry about protecting things, Morty. Everything dies.

### Shield
*1st-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the *magic missile* spell
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 round

An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from *magic missile*.

The spellcasting equivalent of a jockstrap: useful in the right circumstances, but way cooler if you can do your thing without needing it—and eventually it'll need a wash.

### Shield of Faith
*1st-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.

I dunno, I kinda respect this.

A cleric who takes 10 minutes to concentrate on how much they love their god so you can get punched harder. That's pretty metal.

### Shocking Grasp
*Evocation cantrip*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Like shuffling your feet on a carpet just before slapping some sense into a goblin.

### Silence
*2nd-level illusion (ritual*)

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

I like busting this one out on enemy spellcasters and then throwing up the universal sign language for "Oops! Guess you're f***ed!"

### Sleep
*1st-level enchantment*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)
- **Duration**: 1 minute

This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in increasing order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.

A spell that requires me to tiptoe around the battlefield is not my style, Morty. Like, I get that it can be useful, but it still just feels like a stopgap.

It's not full Jerry, but it's also not rushing into my prepared spell list either.

### Spider Climb
*2nd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

### Spirit Guardians
*3rd-level conjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a holy symbol)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature's speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw (no more than once per turn). On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

Crazy ghosts that zap monsters for you?

That's f***ing cool.

It's more hands-off than my typical "crush your enemies, see them driven before you" approach, but I definitely see the appeal.

### Spiritual Weapon
*2nd-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 bonus action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd.

There's nothing as demoralizing as being hit by a big ol' ghost schlong.

### Suggestion
*2nd-level enchantment*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 8 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you choose within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition is not met before the spell expires, the activity is not performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends early.

Here's a real suggestion: don't take a spell that requires 10 minutes of arguing at the table to figure out if it worked or not.

### Thaumaturgy
*Transmutation cantrip*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Up to 1 minute

You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

- Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.
- You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.
- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
- You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.
- You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

This spell wants to be prestidigitation for clerics, but it's definitely on the weak side. Here's some harmless tremors for you—*FAAART*

### Thunderwave
*1st-level evocation*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Self (15-foot cube)
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

![[145-c4-13-rick-hooray.png|right|300]]

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

Let this baby fly when the bass drops, Morty. Trust me. The crowd will go wild.

### Warding Bond
*2nd-level abjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)
- **Duration**: 1 hour

This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends early if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the subject become separated by more than 60 feet. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.

>![[146-ram-head-meh.png|right|300]]
>
>Here's a better idea: How about I don't link my life force to somebody else? I don't know or trust any of these clowns.

### Web
*2nd-level conjuration*

- **Casting Time**: 1 action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.

If the webs are not anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

I'm not here to tell anyone where and when they should blow their personal sticky load, y'know? Th-th-that's a personal choice.

Everybody needs to make their own decisions.

# Appendix A: Conditions
Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

## Blinded
- A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

## Charmed
![[147-ram-condition-charmed.png|right|300]]

- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

## Deafened
- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

## Exhaustion
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

| Level | Effect |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | Disadvantage on ability checks |
| 2 | Speed halved |
| 3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4 | Hit point maximum halved |
| 5 | Speed reduced to 0 |
| 6 | Death |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.

## Frightened
- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
- The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

## Grappled
![[148-ram-condition-grappled.png|right|300]]

- A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the *thunderwave* spell.

## Incapacitated
- An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.

## Invisible
- An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
- Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

## Paralyzed
![[149-ram-condition-paralyzed.png|right|300]]

- A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can't move or speak.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

## Petrified
![[150-ram-condition-petrified.png|right|300]]

- A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
- The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- The creature has resistance to all damage.
- The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

## Poisoned
- A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

## Prone
![[151-ram-condition-prone.png|right|300]]

- A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

## Restrained
- A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.
- The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

## Stunned
![[152-ram-condition-stunned.png|right|300]]

- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

## Unconscious
![[153-ram-condition-unconscious.png|right|300]]

- An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
- The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

# APPENDIX B: WHAT IS THE F***ING POINT?!
Okay, Morty. Maybe it's just the vodka and the tranquilizers talking, b-b-but I think we've reached a critical moment in your D&D education. Y-y-you've internalized a lot of the key features, and you're tingling with anticipation of the adventures to come.

That's good, that's real good. Now your grandpa Rick's gonna blow your tiny mind and teach you the deepest and darkest part of D&D...

NONE OF THIS MATTERS.

What?!

YEAH.

the rules don't MEAN S***.

I know what you're thinking. You're thinking,

"Why the hell did I just go through over sixty pages of dice and rolling and systems and spells and whatever else if none of it matters?! Why do millions of people play this weird nerdy game and invest themselves in it if none of it matters?!"

Y-y-your brain is focused on the game as it is, instead of the game as it could be, Morty. I-I-I told you at the start that D&D is a portal gun, and I meant that, even while I was taking potshots at Wizards of the Coast and their corporate overlord bean counters.

People don't live heroic lives, Morty. They trudge through their feeble existence wishing they had some kind of b-b-b-*BURP*-bigger role in the universe.

That's what D&D really is, Morty.

It's a weird little place where everyone gets to gut goblins and blast bugbears and be kinda sorta awesome for a little while. Sometimes it's weird and annoying but when it works, Morty, when it really works, and your players are putty in the palm of your hand—their hopes and dreams hanging on your every word and a roll of the dice....

That's why we do this, get it?

You know I-I-I'm not a fan of bureaucracy o-o-or systems. I don't do absolutes. Neither should you.

I can teach you D&D Rickth Edition and make it obvious what you should be doing, but in the end you're gonna do it your own way. You're gonna screw it all up and make a mess, and then start over and then screw it up in new and different ways.

Good.

Roll the dice. Get stupid.

entertain yourself. entertain your friends too.

***THE REST DOESN'T MATTER.***

The rest is just corporate branding and nostalgia, sucking face with nihilistic attention-seeking edgelords in search of the mighty dollar.

Yeah, I said it.

Truth bomb barr*uuuuurrrrp*age!

Ready to see how a master crafts a memorable dungeoneering experience, Morty? Keep a hold of your butt cheeks and take a peek at the adventure book:
