# Alchemist's Fire (flask)
**Type**: Mundane Item
**Group**: adventuring gear
**Properties**: 
**Weight**: 1 lb.
**Value**: 50 gp
## Description: 
This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
