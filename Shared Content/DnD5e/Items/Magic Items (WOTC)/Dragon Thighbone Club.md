# Dragon Thighbone Club

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Melee Weapon, Greatclub

**Rarity:** unknown (magic)

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* optional

**Weight**: 250 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d8 bludgeoning

## Description

This red dragon's thighbone is 14 feet long, 250 lbs, and is wrapped in old leather, suggesting that it was once used as a giant's greatclub.

When you hit a creature of the dragon type with this weapon, it deals an extra `dice: 2d8` bludgeoning damage.

If you attune to the greatclub, it magically shrinks to a size that you can wield effectively.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
