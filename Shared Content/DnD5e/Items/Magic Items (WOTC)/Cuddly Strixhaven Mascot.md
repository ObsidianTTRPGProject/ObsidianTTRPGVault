# Cuddly Strixhaven Mascot

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** common

## Description

Representing one of the mascots of Strixhaven, this soft, Tiny, magic toy is perfect for cuddling. If you press it to your arm, shoulder, or leg as an action, the toy stays attached there for 1 hour or until you use an action to remove it.

The toy can also be used to fight off fear. When you make a saving throw to avoid or end the [[Frightened]] condition on yourself, you can give yourself advantage on the roll if the toy is on your person. You must decide to do so before rolling the `dice: d20`. If the save succeeds, you can't use the toy in this way until you finish a long rest.
