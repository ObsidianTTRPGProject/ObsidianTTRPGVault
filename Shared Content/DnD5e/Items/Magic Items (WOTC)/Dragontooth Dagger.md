## Description

A dagger fashioned from the tooth of a dragon. While the blade is obviously a fang or predator's tooth, the handle is leather wrapped around the root of the tooth, and there is no crossguard.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. On a hit with this weapon, the target takes an extra `dice: 1d6` acid
damage.

**Draconic Potency** Against enemies of the Cult of the Dragon, the dagger's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to 2, and the extra acid damage increases to `dice: 2d6`.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
