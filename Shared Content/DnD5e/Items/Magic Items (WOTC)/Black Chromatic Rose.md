# Black Chromatic Rose

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** rare

## Description
While this rose is held, it crackles with acid as a harmless visual effect.

While holding the rose by its stem, you gain resistance to acid damage. If you would take more than 10 acid damage from a single source (after applying the resistance), the rose disintegrates, and you take no damage instead.

As an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of acid. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 3d10` acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property destroys the rose.
