**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Staff, Melee Weapon

## Description

This crooked staff is carved from bone and topped with the skull of a forgotten [[archmage]]  whom [[Acererak]]  destroyed long ago. Etched into the skull's forehead is [[acererak|Acererak's]] rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death.

**Beneficial Properties** While the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

- Your proficiency bonus to Intelligence ([[Arcana]]) and Intelligence ([[History]]) checks is doubled.

- You can't be [[blinded]], [[charmed]], [[deafened]], [[frightened]], [[petrified]], or [[stunned]].

- Undead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them.

- You can wield the staff as a +3 quarterstaff that deals an extra 10 (`dice: 3d6`) necrotic damage on a hit.

**Invoke Curse** The Staff of the Forgotten One has 7 charges and regains `dice: 1d4 + 3` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A [[greater restoration]], [[remove curse]], or similar spell ends the curse on the target.

**The Forgotten One** The bodiless life force of a dead [[archmage]]  empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects [[Acererak]]  from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than [[Acererak]]  expends any of the staff's charges, there is a 50% chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a [[Dispel Evil and Good]]  spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead [[archmage]]  attempts to destroy the staff.

**Destroying the Staff** A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (`dice: 24d10`) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
