### Short Rest

A period of downtime lasting **at least one hour**, during which time you can do nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, or tending to wounds.

**The following effects resolve at the end of a Short Rest:**

-   You regain the use of abilities, features, and resources that are refreshed by taking a Short Rest.
   
-   You are allowed to expend one of your accumulated Hit Die by rolling a die of the corresponding type. You regain hit points equal to the rolled value + your Constitution modifier. Afterwards, you may choose to spend another Hit Die.
