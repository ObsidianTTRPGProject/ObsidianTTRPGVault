# Conditions
## Overview
Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [[Blinded|blinded]], are impairments, but a few, such as [[Invisible|invisible]], can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [[Prone|prone]] condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.
