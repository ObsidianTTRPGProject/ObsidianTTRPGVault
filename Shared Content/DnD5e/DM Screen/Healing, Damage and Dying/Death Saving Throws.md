### Death Saving Throws

**Whenever you start your turn with zero hit points you must make a death saving throw**, not to be confused with a Constitution saving throw.

On a roll of 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail.

On your third success you become stable while on your third failure you die. These results need not be consecutive.

On a roll of 1 you suffer two failures while on a roll of 20 become stable and gain one hit point.
