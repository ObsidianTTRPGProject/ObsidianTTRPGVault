# Improvised Damage

## Overview

*Generic*
In some cases you need to determine damage on the fly. The Improvising Damage table gives you suggestions for when you do so.

## **Improvising Damage**

| Dice  | Examples                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1d10  | Burned by coals, hit by a falling bookcase, pricked by a poison needle                                                                 |

| 4d10  | Hit by falling rubble in a collapsing tunnel, stumbling into a vat of acid                                                             |
| 10d10 | Crushed by compacting walls, hit by whirling steel blades, wading through a lava stream                                                |
| 18d10 | Being submerged in lava, being hit by a crashing flying fortress                                                                       |
| 24d10 | Tumbling into a vortex of fire on the Elemental Plane of Fire, being crushed in the jaws of a godlike creature or a moon-sized monster |
|       |                                                                                                                                        |

The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to how deadly these damage numbers are for characters of various levels. Cross-reference a character's level with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of the damage.

## **Damage Severity and Level**

| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |
| --------------- | ------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1st-4th         | 1d10    | 2d10      | 4d10   |
| 5th-10th        | 2d10    | 4d10      | 10d10  |
| 11th-16th       | 4d10    | 10d10     | 18d10  |
| 17th-20th       | 10d10   | 18d10     | 24d10  |

Damage sufficient to cause a **setback** rarely poses a risk of death to characters of the level shown, but a severely weakened character might be laid low by this damage.

In contrast, **dangerous** damage values pose a significant threat to weaker characters and could potentially kill a character of the level shown if that character is missing many hit points.

As the name suggests, **deadly** damage is enough to drop a character of the level shown to 0 hit points. This level of damage can kill even powerful characters outright if they are already wounded.
