# Crashing
*Source: Astral Adventurer's Guide* 

## Crashing

A spelljammer can run their ship into another object or a creature by moving the ship into the target's space and making a special attack roll (1d20 + the spelljammer's proficiency bonus) against the target's Armor Class. If the attack roll hits, a crash occurs; otherwise, the target moves out of the ship's path, avoiding the crash. If the DM decides that a crash is unavoidable, no attack roll is necessary, and the crash occurs automatically.

When a spelljamming ship crashes into something that could reasonably damage it, both the ship and the creature or object it struck take bludgeoning damage based on the size of the struck object, as shown in the Crash Damage table. If the ship runs into something that doesn't have hit points (such as a planet or a moon), apply the damage only to the ship. The ship stops after crashing into a Gargantuan or immovable creature or object; otherwise, the ship can continue moving if it has any movement left, and whatever it struck moves to the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the ship's path.

After resolving the effect of the crash, determine whether the ship's gravity plane is suppressed (see ""Overlapping Gravity Planes"" earlier in the chapter). If the suppression of a ship's gravity plane would cause the creatures on or inside that ship to fall, they fall in whatever direction is appropriate for the sudden change in gravity. To determine the damage from a fall, see the "falling" rules in the "Player's Handbook".
