## Description
A spore servant is any Large or smaller creature brought back to life by the animating spores of a [[Myconid Sovereign|myconid sovereign]]. A creature that was never flesh and blood to begin with (such as a construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead) can't be turned into a spore servant.

***Retained Characteristics.*** The servant retains its Armor Class, hit points, Hit Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities.

***Lost Characteristics.*** The servant loses its original saving throw and skill bonuses, special senses, and special traits. It loses any action that isn't Multiattack or a melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If it has an action or a melee weapon attack that deals some other type of damage, it loses the ability to deal damage of that type, unless the damage comes from a piece of equipment, such as a magic item.

***Type.*** The servant's type is plant, and it loses any tags.

***Alignment.*** The servant is unaligned.

***Speed.*** Reduce all the servant's speeds by 10 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet

***Ability Scores.*** The servant's ability scores change as follows: Int 2 (-4), Wis 6 (-2), Cha 1 (-5).

***Senses.*** The servant has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet, and it is blind beyond this radius.

***Condition Immunities.*** The servant can't be blinded, charmed, frightened, or paralyzed.

***Languages.*** The servant loses all known languages, but it responds to orders given to it by [[Myconids|myconids]] using rapport spores. The servant gives highest priority to orders received from the most powerful myconid.

***Attacks.*** If the servant has no other means of dealing damage, it can use its fists or limbs to make unarmed strikes. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to `dice: 1d4` + the servant's Strength modifier, or, if the servant is Large, `dice: 2d4` + its Strength modifier.
