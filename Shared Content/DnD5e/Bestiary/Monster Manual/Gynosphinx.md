## Special Traits
***Spellcasting.*** The sphinx is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. The sphinx has the following wizard spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation*
1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, identify, shield*
2nd level (3 slots): *darkness, locate object, suggestion*
3rd level (3 slots): *dispel magic, remove curse, tongues*
4th level (3 slots): *banishment, greater invisibility*
5th level (1 slots): *legend lore*

***Inscrutable.*** The sphinx is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain the sphinx's intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.

***Magic Weapons.*** The sphinx's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The sphinx makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) slashing damage.

## Legendary Actions
The Gynosphinx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Gynosphinxregains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Claw Attack.** The sphinx makes one claw attack.

**Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** The sphinx magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** The sphinx casts a spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.

## Description
A gynosphinx bears the head of a humanoid female. Many have the regal countenances of worldly queens, but some are marked with wild, leonine features. A gynosphinx's eyes see beyond the present time and place, and penetrate veils of invisibility and magic. Supplicants who look deep into those eyes might find themselves magically displaced, banished to some far flung plane where a difficult trial awaits them.

Gynosphinxes are virtual libraries of knowledge and lore. They ask riddles and present puzzles to test the wit of supplicants that come to learn their secrets. Some are willing to bargain with such supplicants for treasure or service.

## A Sphinx's Lair
A sphinx presides over an ancient temple, sepulcher, or vault, within which are hidden divine secrets and treasures beyond the reach of mortals.

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sphinx can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the sphinx can't use an effect again until it finishes a short or long rest:

- The flow of time is altered such that every creature in the lair must reroll initiative. The sphinx can choose not to reroll.
- The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become `dice: 1d20` years older or younger (the sphinx's choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A greater restoration spell can restore a creature's age to normal.
- The flow of time within the lair is altered such that everything within moves up to 10 years forward or backward (sphinx's choice). Only the sphinx is immediately aware of the time change. A wish spell can return the caster and up to seven other creatures designated by the caster to their normal time.
- The sphinx shifts itself and up to seven other creatures it can see within in its lair to another plane of existence. Once outside its lair, the sphinx can't use lair actions, but it can return to its lair as a bonus action on its turn, taking up to seven creatures with it.
