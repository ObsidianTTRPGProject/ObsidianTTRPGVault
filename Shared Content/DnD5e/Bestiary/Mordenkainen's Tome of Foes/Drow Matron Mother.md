## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 20). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: *dancing lights, detect magic*
1/day each: *clairvoyance, darkness, detect thoughts, dispel magic, faerie fire, levitate (self only), suggestion*

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Lolth's Fickle Favor.*** As a bonus action, the matron can bestow the Spider Queen's blessing on one ally she can see within 30 feet of her. The ally takes 7 ( `dice: 2d6`) psychic damage but has advantage on the next attack roll it makes until the end of its next turn.

***Magic Resistance.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Spellcasting.*** The drow is a 20th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom. The drow has the following cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips: *guidance, mending, resistance, sacred flame, thaumaturgy*
1st level (4 slots): *bane, command, cure wounds, guiding bolt*
2nd level (3 slots): *hold person, silence, spiritual weapon*
3rd level (3 slots): *bestow curse, 3, bestow curse, clairvoyance, dispel magic, spirit guardians*
4th level (3 slots): *banishment, death ward, freedom of movement, guardian of faith*
5th level (3 slots): *contagion, flame strike, geas, mass cure wounds*
6th level (2 slots):* blade barier, harm*
7th level (2 slots): *divine word, plane shift*
8th level (1 slots): *holy aura*
9th level (1 slots): *gate*

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The matron mother makes two demon staff attacks or three tentacle rod attacks.

***Demon Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( `dice: 1d6+4`) bludgeoning damage, or 8 ( `dice: 1d8+4`) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands, plus 14 ( `dice: 4d6`) psychic damage. In addition, the target must succeed on a DC19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the drow for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Tentacle Rod.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 3 ( `dice: 1d6`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is hit three times by the rod on one turn, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer the following effects for 1 minute: the target's speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Summon Servant (1/Day).*** The drow magically summons a [[Retriever|retriever]] or a yochlol. The summoned creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

## Legendary Actions
The Drow Matron Mother can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Drow Matron Motherregains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Demon Staff.** The drow makes one attack with her demon staff.

**Compel Demon (Costs 2 Actions).** An allied demon within 30 feet of the drow uses its reaction to make one attack against a target of the drow's choice that she can see.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 1–3 Actions).** The drow expends a spell slot to cast a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell that she has prepared. Doing so costs 1 legendary action per level of the spell.

## Description
At the head of each drow noble house sits a matron mother, an influential priestess of Lolth charged with carrying out the god's will while also advancing the interests of the family. Matron mothers embody the scheming and treachery associated with the Queen of Spiders. Each stands at the center of a vast conspiratorial web, with demons, drow, spiders, and slaves positioned between them and their enemies. Although matron mothers command great power, that power depends on maintaining the Spider Queen's favor, and the dark god sometimes capriciously takes back what she has given. The stat block here represents a matron mother at the height of her power.
