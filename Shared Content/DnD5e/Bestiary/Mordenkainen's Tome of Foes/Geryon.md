## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** Geryon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: *alter self (can become Medium when changing his appearance), detect magic, geas, ice storm, invisibility (self only), locate object, suggestion, wall of ice*
1/day each: *divine word, symbol (pain only)*

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Geryon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Geryon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Geryon's weapon attacks are magical.

***Regeneration.*** Geryon regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Geryon dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** Geryon makes two attacks: one with his claws and one with his stinger.

***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 23 ( `dice: 4d6+9`) slashing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (DC 24) and is restrained until the grapple ends. Geryon can grapple one creature at a time. If the target is already grappled by Geryon, the target takes an extra 27 ( `dice: 6d8`) slashing damage.

***Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 ( `dice: 2d4+9`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 13 ( `dice: 2d12`) poison damage and become poisoned until it finishes a short or long rest. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the poison damage it takes. If its hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. This reduction lasts until the poisoned condition is removed.

***Teleport.*** Geryon magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

## Legendary Actions
The Geryon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Geryonregains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Infernal Glare.** Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. If the target can see Geryon, the target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of Geryon until the end of its next turn.

**Swift Sting (Costs 2 Actions).** Geryon attacks with his stinger.

**Teleport.** Geryon uses his Teleport action.

## Description
Geryon is locked in an endless struggle with Levistus for control of Stygia. The two have fought each other for centuries, each displacing the other innumerable times. Currently, Geryon occupies an odd position in the infernal hierarchy. Although Levistus still claims lordship over Stygia, he has been trapped in an enormous block of ice at the command of Asmodeus. For his part, Geryon marshals his followers and seeks to discover the means to replace his hated rival.

Among the archdevils, Geryon and [[Zariel]] are especially known for martial prowess. He is a ferocious hunter and a relentless tracker. Other devils command legions and bid their followers to battle their enemies. Geryon loves the feeling of flesh and steel being sundered beneath his claws, and the taste of his foes' blood.

His ferocity serves him well in Stygia's frozen waste, but it has also limited his ability to collect souls and forge an effective hierarchy. Sages who study the Nine Hells believe that the battle for control of Stygia is a test staged by Asmodeus in hopes of purging the worst impulses from both Geryon and Levistus, or at the very least opening the door for a competent replacement for both to rise from the ranks.

## Greyon's Lair
Geryon has recently reclaimed his ancient fortress, Coldsteel, a sprawling complex that rises from the ice and snow at the center of Stygia. He roams the passages of this place, scattering the ice devils and minotaur slaves he took from [[Baphomet]], raging against Asmodeus's betrayal while spitting oaths of vengeance and hatching mad schemes to reclaim his standing from Levistus.

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Geryon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Geryon causes a blast of cold to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. The cold fills a cube, 10 feet on each side, centered on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (`dice: 8d6`) cold damage.
- Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. The target can end the effect on itself if it deals any damage to one or more of its allies.
- Geryon casts the banishment spell.

### Regional Effects
The region containing Geryon's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the lair frequently see shimmering portals leading to places they consider safe. Passing through a portal always deposits a traveler somewhere in Stygia.
- Freezing strong winds howl around the area within 1 mile of the lair.
- Howls and screams fill the air within 1 mile of the lair. Any creature that finishes a short or long rest in this area must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or derive no benefit from the rest.

If Geryon dies, these effects fade over the course of `dice: 1d10` days.
