## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** Zariel's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: *alter self (can become Medium when changing her appearance), detect evil and good, fireball, invisibility (self only), wall of fire*
3/day each: *blade barrier, dispel evil and good, finger of death*

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede Zariel's darkvision.

***Magic Weapons.*** Zariel's weapon attacks are magical. When she hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 36 ( `dice: 8d8`) fire damage (included in the weapon attacks below).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Zariel fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Zariel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Regeneration.*** Zariel regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. Zariel dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** Zariel attacks twice with her longsword or with her javelins. She can substitute Horrid Touch for one of these attacks.

***Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 ( `dice: 2d8+8`) slashing damage plus 36 ( `dice: 8d8`) fire damage, or 19 ( `dice: 2d10+8`) slashing damage plus 36 ( `dice: 8d8`) fire damage if used with two hands.

***Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ( `dice: 2d6+8`) piercing damage plus 36 ( `dice: 8d8`) fire damage.

***Horrid Touch (Recharge 5-6).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 44 ( `dice: 8d10`) necrotic damage, and the target is poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target is also blinded and deafened. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Teleport.*** Zariel magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.

## Legendary Actions
The Zariel can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Zarielregains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Immolating Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).** Zariel turns her magical gaze toward one creature she can see within 120 feet of her and commands it to combust. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 ( `dice: 4d10`) fire damage.

**Teleport.** Zariel uses her Teleport action.

## Description
Zariel rules Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, she succumbed to the plane's corrupting influence and fell from grace. She recently reclaimed her position as archdevil of Avernus after the cautious Bel proved inadequate at marshaling his forces to launch offensives against the encroaching demons. Now Bel advises her and helps her manage the war, though many whisper that her true agenda is vengeance against Asmodeus, and her true plan is to drive him from the Nine Hells.

All who enter and exit the Nine Hells must pass through Avernus, so the infernal armies muster on this layer. Here, the [[Amnizu|amnizus]] guard the citadels overlooking the River Styx, much of the fighting of the Blood War takes place, and devils gather to invade the Abyss. Anyone hoping to reach the lower layers must first contend with the darkness of this layer and the myriad threats it houses. Zariel manages it all and has the ultimate say over who comes and goes.

Given her role in the Blood War, Zariel is keenly interested in collecting souls from the greatest warriors on the Material Plane and securing their loyalty. She bargains hard, and mortals end up worse for dealing with her, because she holds all the cards. A bargain with Zariel is eternal; there is little hope of wriggling out of it.

However, she does expect the best from her servants, and so she allows her mortal followers to live out their lives, ever honing their talents, so she can put them to the best use when she finally calls in their debts. As a result, Zariel's servants are universally effective, disciplined, and dangerous.

## Zariel's Lair
Zariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. From nearly a mile away, one can hear the screams and moans coming from the burned victims chained to the stronghold's wall, the dying remains of those who failed to impress the archdevil. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets. Devils of all kinds crawl over the structure, ensuring that no intruders breach their defenses.

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zariel can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Zariel casts major image four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Zariel prefers to create images of intruders' loved ones being burned alive. Zariel doesn't need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. Each creature that can see these illusions must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the illusion for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- Zariel casts her innate fireball spell.

### Regional Effects
The region containing Zariel's lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with screaming voices and the stench of burning meat.
- Once every 60 feet within 1 mile of the lair, 10-foot-high gouts of flame rise from the ground. Any creature or object that touches the flame takes 7 (`dice: 2d6`) fire damage, though it can take this damage no more than once per round.
- The area within 2 miles, but no closer than 500 feet, of the lair is filled with smoke, which causes the area to be heavily obscured. The smoke can't be cleared away.

If Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of `dice: 1d10` days.
