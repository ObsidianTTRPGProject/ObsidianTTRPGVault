## Special Traits
***Aura of Blood Thirst.*** If the flind isn't incapacitated, any creature with the Rampage trait can make a bite attack as a bonus action while within 10 feet of the flind.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The flind makes three attacks: one with each of its different flail attacks or three with its longbow.

***Flail of Madness.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d10+5`) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must make a melee attack against a random target within its reach on its next turn. If it has no targets within its reach even after moving, it loses its action on that turn.

***Flail of Pain.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d10+5`) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (`dice: 4d10`) psychic damage.

***Flail of Paralysis.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d10+5`) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.

***Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d8`) piercing damage.

## Description
A flind is an exceptionally strong and vicious gnoll that commands and directs the war band it is a part of. It wields a flail imbued with powerful magic by Yeenoghu himself.

A war band can have only one flind, and that creature sets a war band's path. Because of its special connection to Yeenoghu, a flind uses god-given omens and demonic insight to guide the gnolls toward weak prey ripe for slaughter.

Unlike other humanoid leaders that might skulk behind their minions, a flind leads the charge in battle. Its flail causes wracking pain, paralysis, and disorientation in those struck by it.
