## Special Traits
***Rampage.*** When it reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the shoosuva can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The shoosuva makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail stinger.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (`dice: 4d10+4`) piercing damage.

***Tail Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned, the target is also paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Description
A shoosuva is a hyena-demon gifted by Yeenoghu to an especially powerful gnoll (typically as a fang ofYeenoghu). A shoosuva manifests shortly after a war band achieves a great victory, emerging from a billowing, fetid cloud of smoke as it arrives from the Abyss. In battle, the demon wraps its slavering jaws around one victim while lashing out with the poisonous stinger on its tail to bring down another one. A creature immobilized by the poison becomes easy pickings for any [[Gnolls|gnolls]] nearby.

Each shoosuva is bonded to a particular gnoll and fights alongside its master. A gnoll that has been gifted with a shoosuva is second only to a [[Flind|flind]] in status within a war band.
