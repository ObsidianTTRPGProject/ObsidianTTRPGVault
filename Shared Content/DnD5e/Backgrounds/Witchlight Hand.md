# Witchlight Hand

You crept into the Witchlight Carnival as a child or youth and never looked back, earning a place among those who work behind the scenes to keep the carnival in business. As a hand, you work hard and party hard. The carnival has borne you to many fantastic worlds, circling back around to your home world once every eight years, but you know almost nothing about these worlds because you spend all your time in the carnival. You know the other hands well, but the carnival’s owners—Mister Witch and Mister Light—remain mysterious to you even after all these years.

Maybe you joined the carnival to escape a dismal life at home, or maybe you were enchanted by the idea of visiting new places or the dream of becoming one of the carnival’s star attractions. Now that you’re older, carnival life has lost some of its appeal. The daily routine has grown tedious, the cyclical nature of the carnival’s journey monotonous. The carnival no longer fills your heart with a sense of wonder. Perhaps greater adventures await you beyond the carnival’s gates.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Performance, Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** [[Disguise kit ]]or one type of musical instrument
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A [[disguise kit]] or a musical instrument of your choice, a deck of cards, a carnival uniform or costume, one trinket (determined by rolling on the Feywild Trinkets table), and a pouch containing 8 gp

## Carnival Companion

Over the years, you have earned the friendship of another carnival fixture. Roll a d8 and consult the Carnival Companion table to determine whom or what you’ve befriended, or you can choose an option that you like. Work with your DM to flesh out this friendship. This companion hangs around you while you’re in the carnival, but it won’t voluntarily leave the carnival.

The DM can use the Witchlight hand stat block in chapter 1 to represent hands, performers, and animal trainers who serve as carnival companions. Statistics for the other companions appear in the Monster Manual.

| 1   | I’m haunted by fey laughter that only I can hear, though I know it’s just my mind playing tricks on me. |
| 2   | Like a nomad, I can’t settle down in one place for very long.                                           |
| 3   | Good music makes me weep like a baby.                                                                   |
| 4   | Wherever I go, I try to bring a little of the warmth and tranquility of home with me.                   |
| 5   | I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder.                                                         |
| 6   | When I have a new idea, I get wildly excited about it until I come up with another, better idea.        |
| 7   | I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules.                                                      |
| 8   | I can’t bring myself to trust most adults.                                                              |

| 6   | Rule of Three. Everything in the multiverse happens in threes. I see the “rule of three” everywhere. (Lawful) |

| 1   | I easily lose track of time. My poor sense of time means I’m always late.                          |
| 2   | I think the whole multiverse is out to get me.                                                     |
