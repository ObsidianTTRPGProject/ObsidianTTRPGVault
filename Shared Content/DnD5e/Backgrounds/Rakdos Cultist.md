# Rakdos Cultist

You’re an entertainer at heart, a performer with a flair for the dramatic and a love of the spotlight. You’ve spent years honing your craft, mastering a demanding set of skills so you can perform them with panache and make them look easy. The wild applause, the screams of the crowds, the mayhem and terror spreading into the streets — this is what you live for.

You’re also a member of a cult devoted to an ancient demon who delights in violence and chaos. It just so happens that Rakdos loves a good show, and your highest aspiration is to please the Defiler, the Lord of Riots, with your own performance.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Acrobatics, Performance
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument
- **Languages:** Choose either Abyssal or Giant
- **Equipment:** A Rakdos insignia, a musical instrument (one of your choice), a costume, a hooded lantern made of wrought iron, a 10-foot length of chain with sharply spiked links, a tinderbox, 10 torches, a set of common clothes, a belt pouch containing 10 gp (a mix of Azorius and Boros 1-zino coins), and a bottle of sweet, red juice

## A Flair for the Dramatic

Rakdos performance styles typically fuse standard circus-style acrobatics with fire, wrought-iron spikes and hooks, and monsters. You can roll a d8 or choose from the options in the Performance Options table to determine your preferred style of performance.

## Feature: Fearsome Reputation

People recognize you as a member of the Cult of Rakdos, and they’re careful not to draw your anger or ridicule. You can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a restaurant or breaking down a door at a local shop, if no legal authorities witness the crime. Most people are too daunted by you to report your wrongdoing to the Azorius.

## Spell List

For you, the spells on the Rakdos Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

| Spell Level | Spells                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cantrip     | [[fire bolt]], [[vicious mockery]]                            |
| 1st         | [[burning hands]], [[dissonant whispers]], [[hellish rebuke]] |
| 2nd         | [[crown of madness]], [[enthrall]], [[flaming sphere]]        |
| 3rd         | [[fear]], [[haste]]                                           |
| 4th         | [[confusion]], [[wall of fire]]                               |
| 5th         | [[dominate person]]                                           |

Your magic often produces a flashy spectacle, wreathing you or your targets in a mixture of harmless flame and shadowy shapes. When you manipulate an opponent’s mind, a flaming symbol of Rakdos might momentarily appear like a mask over the target’s face.

## Suggested Characteristics

Members of demonic cults aren’t generally known as the kindest or most mentally stable individuals, so you’re likely to have something in your nature that distinguishes you from the law-abiding citizens of Ravnica.

### Contacts

Members of demonic cults aren’t generally known as the kindest or most mentally stable individuals, so you’re likely to have something in your nature that distinguishes you from the law-abiding citizens of Ravnica.
