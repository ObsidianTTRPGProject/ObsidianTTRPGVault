# Orzhov Representative

The prospect of immense wealth is the promise of membership in the Orzhov Syndicate. All of the guild’s endeavors channel wealth from Ravnican society into the ranks of the Orzhov — and concentrates the spoils at the top of the hierarchy. As a functionary in that system, your best hope is to claim as much as possible of the money that passes through your hands on its way up, so that you can work your way into a more prominent position.

Regardless of your past and the wealth of your family, your initial status with the guild is near the bottom, until you have proven your value.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Intimidation, Religion
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** An Orzhov insignia, a foot-long chain made of ten gold coins, vestments, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 1 pp (an Orzhov-minted 10-zino coin)

## Feature: Leverage

You can exert leverage over one or more individuals below you in the guild’s hierarchy and demand their help as needs warrant. For example, you can have a message carried across a neighborhood, procure a short carriage ride without paying, or have others clean up a bloody mess you left in an alley. The DM decides if your demands are reasonable and if there are subordinates available to fulfill them. As your status in the guild improves, you gain influence over more people, including ones in greater positions of power.

## Spell List

For you, the spells on the Orzhov Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

| Spell Level | Spells                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cantrip     | [[friends]], [[guidance]]                                   |
| 1st         | [[command]], [[illusory script]]                            |
| 2nd         | [[enthrall]], [[ray of enfeeblement]], [[zone of truth]]    |
| 3rd         | [[bestow curse]], [[speak with dead]], [[spirit guardians]] |
| 4th         | [[blight]], [[death ward]], [[leomund’s secret chest]]      |
| 5th         | [[geas]]                                                    |

Your magic tends to manifest as swirling shadows, brilliant light, or sometimes the momentary appearance of shadowy spirit forms. Your spells might draw the blood of your enemies, or even directly touch their souls.

## Suggested Characteristics

Members of the Orzhov Syndicate range from the decadent nobility at the top of the oligarchy to the debt-ridden wretches at the bottom. You fall somewhere between those extremes, so you might behave with the arrogance of the very rich or the humility of the impoverished.

### Contacts

The Orzhov Syndicate operates according to a strict hierarchy built on a network of connections among old, wealthy families. Your family might provide important contacts, while your family’s activities in crime, banking, or debt collection could tie you to members of other guilds.

Roll twice on the Orzhov Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Orzhov Contacts table.
