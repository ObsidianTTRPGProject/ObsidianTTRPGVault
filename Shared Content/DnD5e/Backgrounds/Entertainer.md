### Feature: By Popular Demand

You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble’s court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.

### Suggested Characteristics

Successful entertainers have to be able to capture and hold an audience’s attention, so they tend to have flamboyant or forceful personalities. They’re inclined toward the romantic and often cling to high-minded ideals about the practice of art and the appreciation of beauty.

| 2   | Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip.                 |
| 3   | I’m a hopeless romantic, always searching for that “special someone.”                     |
| 4   | Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension. |
| 5   | I love a good insult, even one directed at me.                                            |
| 6   | I get bitter if I’m not the center of attention.                                          |
| 7   | I’ll settle for nothing less than perfection.                                             |
| 8   | I change my mood or my mind as quickly as I change key in a song.                         |

| 2   | Tradition. The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten, for they teach us who we are. (Lawful) |
| 3   | Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic)                                               |

| 5   | People. I like seeing the smiles on people’s faces when I perform. That’s all that matters. (Neutral)                  |
| 6   | Honesty. Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are. (Any)                   |
