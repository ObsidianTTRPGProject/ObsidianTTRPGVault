# Character Names
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 173* 

Some players and DMs have a knack for coming up with  character names on the fly, while others find that task  more of a challenge. The tables in this appendix are  designed to make life easier for both kinds of people,  whether you're naming a player character, a nonplayer  character, a monster, or even a place.

Each table contains names that are associated with  a nonhuman character race in the player's handbook or a real-world ethnic or language group, with a focus  on groups from antiquity and the Middle Ages. You can select from the possibilities here, or use dice to determine a name.

Even though names are associated with races in this  appendix, a character might not have a name from their  own race. For instance, a half-orc might have grown up  among dwarves and have a dwarven name. Or, as DM,  you might decide that dragonborn in your campaign  have a culture reminiscent of ancient Rome and therefore use Roman names, rather than the dragonborn  names suggested here.

See the names page for the full collection of name tables.
