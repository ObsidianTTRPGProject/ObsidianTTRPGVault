# Explosive Seed
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This acorn-sized sphere of brass contains a small amount of blasting powder and a clockwork trigger. An explosive seed can be thrown up to 30 feet as an action, detonating on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding seed must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
