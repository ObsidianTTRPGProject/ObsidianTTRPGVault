# Izzet Keyrune
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a member of the Izzet guild)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Formed of carved and polished red and blue stone, the keyrune includes bits of cable and wire. One end resembles a humanlike head, suggesting the jagged elemental form of the [galvanice weird](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/galvanice-weird-ggr.md) that it can become for a duration of 3 hours. In this form, it will serve you as a bodyguard, lift and carry things for you, act as a test subject for your experiments, or aid you in any other way that its capabilities allow.

When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a [galvanice weird](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/galvanice-weird-ggr.md). If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform.

The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.

At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.
