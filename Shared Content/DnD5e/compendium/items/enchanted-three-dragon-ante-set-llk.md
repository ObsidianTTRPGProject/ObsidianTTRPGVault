# Enchanted Three-Dragon Ante Set
*Gaming Set*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

One card in this deck is enchanted to appear as whatever specific card its owner commands. This magic works only 25 percent of the time, but the deck is worth 500 gp to any serious gambler who doesn't mind the risk—or who isn't told about it.
