# Basic Fishing Equipment
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 1 sp
- **Weight**: ⏤

Basic Fishing Equipment includes a pole, a line, a hook, and either a lure or some bait.

Fishing is a popular pastime in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, though this activity isn't possible aboard a ship that is moving faster than its flying speed. At the end of each hour spent fishing, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during that hour. On a successful check, roll a d10 and consult the Fishing table to determine the catch.

| dice: d10 | Catch |
|-----------|-------|
| 1–2 | Tiny, inedible fish (a creature that consumes it is poisoned for 1 hour) |
| 3–5 | Tiny, edible fish (feeds one person) |
| 6–8 | Small, edible fish (feeds up to four people) |
| 9 | Hostile [space eel](/compendium/bestiary/beast/space-eel-bam.md) (see "Boo's Astral Menagerie"; feeds up to twelve people) |
| 10 | Hostile [gray scavver](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/gray-scavver-bam.md) (see "Boo's Astral Menagerie"; feeds up to twenty people), some other creature of the DM's choosing, or an Tiny object of the DM's choosing |
