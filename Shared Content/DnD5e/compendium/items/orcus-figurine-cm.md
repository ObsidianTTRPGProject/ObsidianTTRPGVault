# Orcus Figurine
*Wondrous Item, unknown (magic)*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Carved from an ogre's [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) heart, the gray figurine depicts the Demon Prince of Undeath in ghastly detail, clutching his skull-topped wand in one hand and three severed heads by the hair in the other. The figurine smells like decaying flesh, and this scent is detectable out to a range of 5 feet.

The figurine is a Tiny object with AC 17, 3 hit points, and immunity to all types of damage except radiant damage. A [detect evil and good](/compendium/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) spell or similar magic reveals that the figurine has been desecrated. As long as it has at least 1 hit point, the figurine has the following magical properties:

- Undead within 30 feet of the figurine can't be turned.
- Dead creatures within 30 feet of the figurine can't be brought back to life.
- A creature that holds the figurine while praying to Orcus for at least 1 hour has a 10|10 percent% chance chance of summoning a smoky avatar of the demon lord. Once this avatar is summoned, it can't be summoned again for 30 days. Orcus's avatar has the statistics of a [wraith](/compendium/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) except that it's chaotic evil. It attacks all non-undead creatures it encounters, and it disappears after 1 hour or when reduced to 0 hit points.
