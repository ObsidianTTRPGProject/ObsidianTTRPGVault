# Ring of Red Fury
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This ring has a stripe of ruidium running through it. While wearing the ring, you gain the following benefits:

- You can breathe water.
- You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

## Ruidium Rage

As a bonus action, you can use the ring to gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute or until you are [incapacitated](/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated):

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you hit with an attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.
- Difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement, and you are immune to the [paralyzed](/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) and [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) conditions.

You can't use this property of the ring again until you finish a long rest.

## Ruidium Corruption

When you use the Ruidium Rage property of the ring, you must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

## If Ruidium Is Destroyed

If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and the ring of red fury becomes a [ring of free action](/compendium/items/ring-of-free-action.md).
