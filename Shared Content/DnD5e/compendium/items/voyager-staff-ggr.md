You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. While you hold it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [banishment](/compendium/spells/banishment.md) (4 charges), [blink](/compendium/spells/blink.md) (3 charges), [misty step](/compendium/spells/misty-step.md) (2 charges), [passwall](/compendium/spells/passwall.md) (5 charges), or [teleport](/compendium/spells/teleport.md) (7 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes forever.
