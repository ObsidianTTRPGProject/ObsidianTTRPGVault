# Gold Canary Figurine of Wondrous Power
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This gold statuette is carved in the likeness of a canary and is small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature in one of two forms (you choose). If there isn't enough space for the creature where it would appear, the figurine doesn't become a creature. The two forms are as follows:

## Giant Canary Form

The figurine becomes a [giant canary](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-canary-ftd.md) for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a [giant canary](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-canary-ftd.md), it can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

## Gold Dragon Form

While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an [adult gold dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-gold-dragon.md) (see its stat block in the Monster Manual) for up to 1 hour. The dragon can't use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an [adult gold dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-gold-dragon.md), it can't be used this way again until 1 year has passed.

In either form, the creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each form. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the description.
