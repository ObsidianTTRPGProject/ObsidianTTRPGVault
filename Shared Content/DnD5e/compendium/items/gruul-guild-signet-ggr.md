# Gruul Guild Signet
*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This ring, adorned with the symbol of Gruul, allows you to cast [compelled duel](/compendium/spells/compelled-duel.md). A guild signet is sometimes awarded to a guild member whose renown score in that guild is 5 or higher, as a reward for performing special services for the guild. Aside from its magical properties, the ring is also an indicator of Gruul's recognition and favor.

A signet has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).
