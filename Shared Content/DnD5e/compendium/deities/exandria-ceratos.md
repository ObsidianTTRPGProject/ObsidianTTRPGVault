A being that slipped from the Far Realm into Exandria before the Founding, Ceratos is one of the oldest creatures in the world. A single creature of many minds, Ceratos reveled in chaos. When the Elemental Chaos was divided into four planes, Ceratos retreated underground, their minds unraveling as they entered a nightmarish slumber.

The digging of the Crawling King woke Ceratos a long time after. Though their minds were scattered, each desired the return of chaos to unite themselves. So Ceratos sent thoughts to the surface, offering magic to those who could create chaos in the land above, so that they might one day regain their full power. Ceratos tells their followers that chaos brings clarity and destruction begets rebirth.

## Appearance

Ceratos is thought to be a massive skinless sphere of flesh covered in mismatched eyes, mouths, and tentacles. They can project their minds' thoughts into other creatures, especially those who desire to bring chaos to the world.
