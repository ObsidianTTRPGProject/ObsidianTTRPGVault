## Traits

### Size

You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

### Claws

You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

### Hold Breath

You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.

### Natural Armor

Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can't wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.

### Nature's Intuition

Thanks to your mystical connection to nature, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: [Animal Handling](/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling), [Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine), [Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature), [Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception), [Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth), or [Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival).

### Shell Defense

You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone), your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.

## Description

Tortles have a saying: "We wear our homes on our backs." These turtle folk live on many worlds, most often journeying up and down coasts, along waterways, and across the sea. Tortles don't have a unified story of how they were created, but they all have a sense of being mystically connected to the natural world. Carrying their shelter on their backs gives tortles a special feeling of security wherever they go, for even if they visit a far, unknown country, they have a place to lay their heads.

Tortles exhibit the same range of coloration and patterns found among turtles, and many tortles enjoy adorning their shells in distinctive ways.
