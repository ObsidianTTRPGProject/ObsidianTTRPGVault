## Traits

### Age

Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

### Size

Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

### Darkvision

Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Keen Senses

You have proficiency in the [Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception) skill.

### Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put you to sleep.

### Trance

Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

> [!note]
> If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

### Incisive Sense

You have advantage on Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) and Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks.

### Blessing of the Moon Weaver

You know the [light](/compendium/spells/light.md) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [sleep](/compendium/spells/sleep.md) spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [invisibility](/compendium/spells/invisibility.md) spell (targeting yourself only) once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Casting these spells with this trait doesn't require material components. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
