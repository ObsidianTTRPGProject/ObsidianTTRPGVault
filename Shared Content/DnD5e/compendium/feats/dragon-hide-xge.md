# Dragon Hide
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  

***Prerequisites*** Dragonborn

You manifest scales and claws reminiscent of your draconic ancestors. You gain the following benefits:

- Your scales harden. While you aren't wearing armor, you can calculate your AC as 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
- You grow retractable claws from the tips of your fingers. Extending or retracting the claws requires no action. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the normal bludgeoning damage for an unarmed strike.
