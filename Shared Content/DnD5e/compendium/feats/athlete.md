*Source: Player's Handbook p. 165*  

You have undergone extensive physical training to gain the following benefits:

- When you are [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone), standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement.
- Climbing doesn't cost you extra movement.
- You can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.
