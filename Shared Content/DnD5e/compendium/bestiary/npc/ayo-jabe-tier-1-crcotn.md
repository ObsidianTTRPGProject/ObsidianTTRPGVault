## Description

As the de facto leader of a new, unnamed adventuring party, Ayo Jabe has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders. She and her companions have worked odd jobs around the town of Jigow for a few weeks now, and she's starting to feel confident that they're ready for real adventure.

Ayo is a water genasi who was born to orc parents during a terrible storm in the Emerald Gulch. Her family has lived in Jigow for generations, and she's eager to leave home and see the world.

Ayo picked up her combat skills while working as a hunter for the town of Jigow. She recently joined up with her childhood friend Dermot, as well as Maggie Keeneyes, a mercenary who came to town several weeks ago. Despite Maggie's brusque demeanor, she became a loyal friend of Ayo and Dermot, and the three of them have become inseparable, even as more adventurers have joined their party.

Ayo is hotheaded and appreciates people who make decisions as impulsively as she does. Nevertheless, she respects Dermot's even-tempered advice and dutifully plays the role of the wise leader. She has no patience for people who are indecisive, and she is infuriated by people who don't say what they really mean.
