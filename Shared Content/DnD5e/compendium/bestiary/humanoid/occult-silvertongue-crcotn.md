## Description

Occult silvertongues are charismatic leaders. The alien mysteries to which they expose themselves can leave them feeling restless, paranoid, and suspicious. They begin to see things that aren't there and imagine conspiracies brought on by fears that others are trying to supplant them.

**Occultists of the Vermilion Dream.** The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is viewed as an esoteric, profit-driven, but ultimately harmless cabal of ghost hunters and perpetuators of urban legends. This perception isn't inaccurate, but the consortium's leadership is obsessed with one set of legends in particular: those involving the Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus, and the ancient figures cursed by exposure to its alien influence.

The cruelest desires and predilections of the consortium's most obsessive agents have been enhanced by contact with ruidium-tainted items.
