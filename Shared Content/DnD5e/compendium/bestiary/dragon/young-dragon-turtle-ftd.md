## Description

Dragon turtles are mighty creatures whose inherent magic is intimately linked with the oceans of the Material Plane. The dragon turtle presented in the _Monster Manual_is a typical adult, at least a century old and boasting a valuable hoard. You can use the stat blocks in this section for older or younger dragon turtles. In addition, chapter 5 includes lair actions and regional effects that can be used for adult or ancient dragon turtles. An ancient dragon turtle is a mythic creature akin to a greatwyrm, combining the power of multiple echoes from across the worlds of the Material Plane. Such a creature can be as large as an island—and indeed, legends suggest that many unwitting sailors wrecked at sea have mistaken slumbering dragon turtles for solid ground.

Ancient dragon turtles might sleep for years or decades while floating along the surface of the ocean, enjoying the warmth of the sun and letting vegetation take root on their shells. An angry ancient dragon turtle is terrible to behold, radiating heat from the shell to boil the surrounding water—and any creatures in it. And even if an enemy wears down the dragon turtle's defenses, magical storms manifest to shield the dragon turtle and strike at foes.

**Creating a Dragon Turtle.** Use the Dragon Turtle Personality Traits and Dragon Turtle Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive dragon turtle characters, and use the Dragon Turtle Spellcasting table to help select spells for a spellcasting dragon. (Though the _Monster Manual_doesn't explicitly include dragon turtles in the variant rules for making a dragon a spellcaster, you can apply those rules to these aquatic dragons.)

**Dragon Turtle Personality Traits.** | dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I speak slowly and deliberately, pausing to reflect after (or sometimes in the middle of) each utterance. |
| 2 | I am more interested in the shiny baubles people carry than in anything they have to say. |
| 3 | I think of ships as kindred spirits and like to rub affectionately against their keels. |
| 4 | I like to show visitors the vastness of my domain, so they appreciate how insignificant they are. |
| 5 | I attack anyone I notice taking from the sea's bounty without offering something in return. |
| 6 | I think of sailors' songs as their "water speech" and try to converse with them by humming snippets of tunes I have overheard. |
| 7 | I swim alongside ships sailing through my domain, just out of arrow range, so they know I am watching. |
| 8 | I am fascinated by the politics of surface realms and talk endlessly with sailors and adventurers to stay current on the latest happenings on land. |

**Dragon Turtle Ideals.** | dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Endurance. We who dwell beneath the waves can weather all storms. (Any) |
| 2 | Indifference. What do I care for the fleeting concerns of those who crawl upon the land? (Any) |
| 3 | Curiosity. I want to know about everything that enters my domain, especially oddities from the surface world. (Any) |
| 4 | Supremacy. Creatures who refuse to recognize my rule over these waters suffer my displeasure. (Lawful or Evil) |
| 5 | Preservation. I am the ocean's steward, tending reefs and waters to ensure that they remain unspoiled. (Lawful) |
| 6 | Eradication. The peoples of the surface world were a mistake of creation. I will correct that error. (Evil) |

| 3 | After an unwise attack from a whaling ship, a dragon turtle pursued the ship back to harbor and now attacks any ship that tries to leave. |
| 4 | The sea around a wizard's tower is too stormy for ships to sail through, but a resident dragon turtle might be convinced to ferry the characters across. |
| 5 | A royal bathhouse was renowned for its sauna, until the dragon turtle supplying the steam escaped and started rampaging through the palace. |
| 6 | A millennium ago, a fabled sword was buried at sea with its wielder. Now the sword must be found, and only a dragon turtle remembers where it is. |
| 7 | A dragon turtle has taken up residence in a subterranean lake, and the steam has been driving other creatures up out of their tunnels toward the surface. |
| 8 | A sea god has sent a dragon turtle to unleash devastation along a populated coast. |

**Connected Creatures.** Dragon turtles are stolid and slow to anger. This temperament, combined with their disinterest in moral quandaries, allows them to get along with—or at least abide—most creatures they encounter. They frequently enter symbiotic relationships with other sea creatures that can bring them food or treasure, and they sometimes agree to work for creatures who ply them with generous sums of wealth.
