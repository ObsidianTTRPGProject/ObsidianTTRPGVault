# Gruul Anarch
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 60*

- **Tool Proficiencies.** [Herbalism kit](/compendium/items/herbalism-kit.md)
- **Languages.** Choose one of Draconic, Giant, Goblin, or Sylvan
- **Equipment.** A Gruul insignia, a [hunting trap](/compendium/items/hunting-trap.md), an [herbalism kit](/compendium/items/herbalism-kit.md), the skull of a boar, a beast-hide cloak, a set of [traveler's clothes](/compendium/items/travelers-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/compendium/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)

The entire world of Ravnica is a sprawling metropolis, but you are a native of the wild areas that still exist—the abandoned districts, the rubblebelts, the overgrown parks, and the crumbling ruins. You are part of a savage society that clings desperately to the Old Ways—attuned to nature, full of primal rage, and given short shrift by a world consumed with continuing civilization's march of progress.

## Feature: Rubblebelt Refuge

You are intimately familiar with areas of the city that most people shun: ruined neighborhoods where wurms rampaged, overgrown parks that no hand has tended in decades, and the vast, sprawling rubblebelts of broken terrain that civilized folk have long abandoned. You can find a suitable place for you and your allies to hide or rest in these areas. In addition, you can find food and fresh water in these areas for yourself and up to five other people each day.

## Gruul Guild Spells

_Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature_

For you, the spells on the Gruul Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

Fueled by the fire of rage burning in your heart, your magic is almost always accompanied by fiery effects, such as flames smoldering behind your eyes or dancing over your hands.

## Suggested Characteristics

Gruul ways aren't the ways of civilized folk, and the Gruul have little patience for social niceties. But they do have cherished traditions and values, just as important to them as the different values held by the urban, cosmopolitan culture of Ravnica.

## Contacts

The members of the Gruul Clans rely on each other even as they vie for territory and glory. Their encounters with members of other guilds are more often violent than friendly, but occasional bonds do form.

Roll twice on the Gruul Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Gruul Contacts table.

**Gruul Contacts**

| dice: d8 | Contact |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | One of my parents is a renowned warrior in my clan. |
| 2 | My sibling has the ear of the clan chief. |
| 3 | I have cousins in a different clan. |
| 4 | When we were younger, I was romantically involved with a prominent warrior in my clan. |
| 5 | A druid in my clan believes I have a destiny to fulfill. |
| 6 | The warrior who trained me remembers me for my exceptional potential. |
| 7 | My clan chief killed one of my parents, who had challenged the chief for leadership of the clan. Some combination of resentment and remorse stirs the clan chief to help me sometimes. |
| 8 | I made a strong impression on Borborygmos. |

## How Do I Fit In?

In service of a simple goal, you have a simple part to play: Fight. Unleash your rage. Flatten buildings and defeat those who stand in your way. Be Gruul, in your own way.

You will frequently be summoned to participate in a raid your clan is launching against the city or against a group of its defenders. Your clan leader might also send you on a special mission, though it would almost certainly still qualify as a raid. You might join a small group of Gruul warriors on a dangerous charge deep into the settled streets to plunder a certain location, retrieve an item stolen from your clan, or assault a Boros garrison.

Sometimes your objective might be more esoteric. With prophecies of the return of Ilharg the Raze-Boar spreading like wildfire among the Gruul druids, you might be asked to carry out some task that the druids believe will speed his coming. Such a task might involve collecting a sacred relic held in an Orzhov vault or collecting sacrifices for a grand ceremony in the Raze-Boar's honor.
