# Sage
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 137*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana), [History](/rules/skills.md#History)
- **Languages.** Two of your choice
- **Equipment.** A [bottle of black ink](/compendium/items/ink-1-ounce-bottle.md), a quill, a small knife, a letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have not yet been able to answer, a set of [common clothes](/compendium/items/common-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/compendium/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp

You spent years learning the lore of the multiverse. You scoured manuscripts, studied scrolls, and listened to the greatest experts on the subjects that interest you. Your efforts have made you a master in your fields of study.

## Feature: Researcher

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

## Suggested Characteristics

Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other ideals.
