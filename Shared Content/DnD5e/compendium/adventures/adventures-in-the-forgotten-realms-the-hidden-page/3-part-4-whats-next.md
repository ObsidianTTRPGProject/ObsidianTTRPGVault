# Part 4: What's Next
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: The Hidden Page, p. 12* 

The adventurers likely have new lore at hand and questions about what's next. The subsequent adventure's hooks take them back into the High Moors to seek a lost tomb, where Sylvene and old allies have been laid to rest and new secrets wait to be discovered.

Soon, the full scope of Tyreus's villainous plan comes into view.
