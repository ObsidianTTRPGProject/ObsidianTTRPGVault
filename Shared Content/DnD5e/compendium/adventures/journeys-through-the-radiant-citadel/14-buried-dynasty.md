*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel* 

_An Adventure for 13th-Level Characters_

For thousands of years, ancient magic and [potions of longevity](/compendium/items/potion-of-longevity.md) sustained imperial rule over the land of Great Xing. Each emperor's supernaturally long life span ensured the peace and stability of the realm. But now the imperial secrets of longevity have been lost, and if the long rule of the [White Jade Emperor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/white-jade-emperor-jttrc.md) draws to a close, control of the empire will pass to another in a disruptive transition the likes of which have been unknown for generations.

## Background

Grand Secretary [Wei Feng Ying](/compendium/bestiary/npc/wei-feng-ying-jttrc.md) governs at the emperor's command. For years, she has known that imperial alchemists sustain the emperor's life using [potions of longevity](/compendium/items/potion-of-longevity.md) enhanced with an ingredient that makes them more potent. But now the source of that ingredient has been depleted. The secretary fears that this additive—powdered shards from the eggshell of the legendary Dragon of Heavenly Blessings—might be irreplaceable.

Secretary Wei has sent agents to scour the land for imperial troves containing _potions of longevity_, hoping to find more of the lost ingredient. Recently, this search unearthed ancient court documents mentioning a secret cache belonging to the Mountain Cloud Empress, a mysterious figure of the long-fallen Yun dynasty. Secretary Wei gave orders to begin excavating the Old City buried beneath Yongjing, the capital of Great Xing, and she now seeks adventurers to investigate the ruins under the guise of historical scholarship—not sharing with them that they are actually hunting for a specific secret.

### Setting the Adventure

Use the following suggestions to help locate Yongjing in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters traveling from the Radiant Citadel arrive less than a mile from the southern gate of Yongjing in a plaza staffed by helpful attendants. If you want to add further detail to the lands around Yongjing, use the "Yongjing Gazetteer" section at this adventure's end as a starting point.
- **Forgotten Realms.** Yongjing could be the capital of any nation east of the Sunrise Mountains or of a new island realm in the Trackless Sea. Alternatively, lands such as Chessenta, Impiltur, or another place along the southern Sword Coast could be recast as parts of Great Xing.
- **Mystara.** Yongjing might lie west of the Republic of Darokin and unite multiple lands under the banner of its empire.

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure:

- **Bargaining for Life.** The characters need life-extending magic. Secretary Wei hears of their plight and offers to provide the characters with a [potion of longevity](/compendium/items/potion-of-longevity.md) if they complete a mission for her.
- **Bureaucratic Invitation.** Secretary Wei invites the characters to Yongjing for a meeting about investigating the ruins of the Old City beneath Yongjing.
- **Political Pawns.** An agent of the emperor or his family asks the characters to meet with Secretary Wei and aid her in any way they can—thereby drawing the characters into the city's politics.

### Secrets of Immortality

This adventure embroils characters in a conspiracy involving the highest levels of Yongjing's government. Before running the adventure, familiarize yourself with the "Yongjing Gazetteer" section. Keep the following details of the conspiracy secret, revealing them only when the adventure text instructs you to do so.

#### Dragon's Blessing

When the rulers of Yongjing reach an advanced age, they use [potions of longevity](/compendium/items/potion-of-longevity.md) to increase their life span. These potions are supplemented with a rare reagent called Dragon's Blessing. The primary ingredient of this reagent is powdered eggshell from a legendary being known as the Dragon of Heavenly Blessings.

Normally, a creature can benefit from only a limited number of _potions of longevity_ before continued consumption is likely to age the drinker rather than reduce their age. When a pinch of Dragon's Blessing is added to a _potion of longevity_, however, the draught has no chance of aging its drinker no matter how many _potions of longevity_ that individual has consumed. With enough of this reagent and enough _potions of longevity_, Yongjing's rulers could conceivably live forever. But this immortality is not protection against a violent death: murder, revolution, or some other dire fate has ended each past emperor's rule.

#### End of an Emperor

The emperor of Great Xing is dying—he just doesn't know it yet. In a few months, when he next uses a [potion of longevity](/compendium/items/potion-of-longevity.md) to extend his life, he'll learn that the imperial supply of Dragon's Blessing has been depleted—and this potion might age him rather than adding years to his life.

Currently, only the imperial alchemists and their overseer, Grand Secretary Wei, are aware of this fact. The alchemists have not made this information known, at the grand secretary's command.

#### End of an Era

Grand Secretary Wei, the leader of the emperor's government, knows that the secret of the emperor's long life has been depleted. A lifelong servant of the empire, Wei fears the upheaval that historically occurs after the death of a ruler, as several claimants to the throne vie for power in the political vacuum. In response, Wei has set her considerable network of agents to covertly work toward two goals:

- **Preserving the Emperor.** Assuring the emperor's continued rule is the easiest way to maintain the nation's peace and political continuity. Secretary Wei's most trusted agents have been quietly scouring the land for more Dragon's Blessing, seeking it in the ruins and crypts of dynasties past.
- **Preserving the Empire.** Fearing the emperor's death might be inevitable, Secretary Wei cements her political power and firms up her alliances behind the scenes. She hopes to make her political position unassailable so she can ease the transition of power from the old emperor to a worthy successor of her choice.

The Grand Secretary hides the truth of the emperor's condition from her liege and all but her most trusted agents, believing herself the only person fit to steer the empire through the challenges to come. Maintaining this secret is of the utmost importance, because general knowledge of the emperor's looming demise would precipitate a host of political schemes throughout Yongjing's vast bureaucracy.

## Starting the Adventure

When the characters are ready to attend their audience with Secretary Wei, they must meet her at the Hall of Divine Wisdom in Yongjing (see the "Yongjing Gazetteer" section). Read or paraphrase the following description when they arrive at the hall:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Sunlight glints on the plaza in front of the grand palace known as the Hall of Divine Wisdom. Hundreds of petitioners mill about—dwarves and humans dressed in farm clothes, merchant's robes, or scholar's coats—all hoping to speak to the emperor. Ministers circulate among them, easily distinguished by their winged black caps. A minister speaks briefly with each petitioner. Most of these exchanges end with the minister dismissively directing the petitioner to turn around and leave through the main gates. Soon enough, a minister approaches you.
^439

The minister who meets the characters greets them and indifferently asks what their business is at the hall. If a character politely explains they're expected by Secretary Wei, the minister ushers them forward with a bow. If the characters aren't civil or they waste the magistrate's time, a character must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or they are made to wait for an hour while the indignant magistrate takes his time confirming the party's story.

Once it's clear the characters are here to see Secretary Wei, the minister directs the crowd to part, opening a path through the onlookers.

### Meeting the Secretary

Two guards meet the characters at the entrance to the Hall of Divine Wisdom and escort them to an elegant meeting room:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls of this room are paneled with delicate latticework, and beautifully carved rosewood chairs surround a matching table. One wall bears a sumptuous silk hanging that depicts a gold dragon soaring through the clouds.
^43b

After a short wait, a middle-aged human woman enters, wearing fine red robes embroidered with stylized ki-rins. She introduces herself with amiable professionalism as Grand Secretary Wei. The characters already know that Wei holds a lofty political position and has influence exceeded only by Yongjing's emperor.

#### Grand Secretary Wei

[Wei Feng Ying](/compendium/bestiary/npc/wei-feng-ying-jttrc.md) (lawful neutral, human [archmage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) commands respect from all as Grand Secretary, the leader of the government of Yongjing. Since the nation's rulers' source of extreme longevity has vanished, Secretary Wei is determined to hold the country together (as detailed in the "End of an Era" section). The secretary has an array of spell scrolls and other magic items at her disposal, and she often makes use of her [crystal ball of telepathy](/compendium/items/crystal-ball-of-telepathy.md) and spells like [project image](/compendium/spells/project-image.md) when dealing with her agents.

##### Personality Trait

"Others need to know only what's necessary to accomplish my goals."

##### Ideal

"Peace, efficiency, and the smooth running of the imperial machine must be upheld whatever the cost."

##### Bond

"My life and my service to the empire are one."

##### Flaw

"I know what's best for the empire."

#### Archaeological Assignment

Secretary Wei thanks the characters for answering her call and for their interest in investigating the historic ruins of old Yongjing. As attendants enter to serve tea, she ask the characters about their training, their education, and what skills they bring to an underground expedition into a potentially dangerous area. She's eager to hear about their most spectacular deeds and is quick to flatter those who indulge her with such tales.

After hearing about the characters' exploits, Secretary Wei explains the assignment, highlighting the following points:

- This archaeological expedition seeks to collect accounts and relics from past rulers for the benefit of future ones.
- Historians believe that the palace of the last ruler of the Yun dynasty—known as the Mountain Cloud Empress—lies in the Old City beneath present-day Yongjing.
- Wei wishes the characters to guard her handpicked scholar as they delve into the Old City.
- Of particular interest to Wei are the diaries of the Mountain Cloud Empress, which would have been kept along with her greatest treasures.

As the conversation concludes, a friendly young human arrives and bows to Secretary Wei. The secretary introduces this newcomer as [Lu Zhong Yin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lu-zhong-yin-jttrc.md), the expedition's lead historian.

Secretary Wei also presents a scroll bearing a contract for the characters to sign. The contract calls for an initial payment of 1,000 gp per character, plus an additional 1,000 gp per character when [Lu Zhong Yin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lu-zhong-yin-jttrc.md) is brought safely back from the Old City and the scholar deems the investigation complete.

Finally, the secretary provides the characters with a spell scroll of [sending](/compendium/spells/sending.md), which they can use to contact her if the need arises. Wei intends for the expedition to set out as soon as possible after the characters collect their initial payment, but they can take a few hours to rest and prepare if necessary.

#### What's Left Unsaid

Secretary Wei's true goal is to search the buried Yun dynasty ruins for any sign of Dragon's Blessing—a magical reagent of particular importance to the emperor. She has no interest in the Mountain Cloud Empress's diaries, but she suspects that such secret writings would be held alongside other state secrets, like any stashed trove of Dragon's Blessing. Wei does not reveal her true agenda to the characters, but she has briefed [Lu Zhong Yin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lu-zhong-yin-jttrc.md) on her goals, the need for secrecy, and the necessity of recovering this reagent (though not why it's important).

Secretary Wei also plans to monitor the group's investigation by using her [crystal ball of telepathy](/compendium/items/crystal-ball-of-telepathy.md) to regularly cast [scrying](/compendium/spells/scrying.md) on Zhong Yin. During the investigation, Zhong Yin purposely fails the saving throws to resist the spell.

### The Shy Scholar

Once the contract is signed, Secretary Wei directs the characters to take the scroll to the Ministry of Finance to collect their first payment. With the shy excitement of someone who can't believe they're in the presence of heroes, Zhong Yin escorts the characters to the ministry offices in the domain of the Octadic Council (see the "Yongjing Gazetteer" section for more information).

#### Lu Zhong Yin

[Lu Zhong Yin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lu-zhong-yin-jttrc.md) (lawful neutral, human [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)) is an unremarkable human, about twenty years old and exuding an eager-to-please air. To the characters, Zhong Yin claims to be a scholar of ancient Xing history. In truth, the scholar is an Imperial Ghost, a spy of the court. Zhong Yin serves Secretary Wei and is currently helping with the search for Dragon's Blessing.

##### Personality Trait

"There's nothing interesting about me. Tell me about yourself instead."

##### Ideal

"My work might go unseen, but it contributes to a greater whole."

##### Bond

"Secretary Wei saw the hidden potential in me, and I am forever grateful."

##### Flaw

"I'll follow any order from my commanders if it serves the greater good."

#### The Old City Expedition

Zhong Yin is bright and eager to hear about the characters' past adventures. During conversation with the characters, the following topics might come up:

- The city of Yongjing has existed on this site for thousands of years, enduring numerous dynasties and countless disasters. Ruins known as the Old City lie beneath the modern city.
- Expeditions into these scattered, unconnected ruins can be dangerous. Beyond collapsing architecture, ancient traps and monsters sometimes lurk within.
- Traces of ancient magical protections linger within the ruins. The most common bar the use of magical methods of travel, such as teleportation.
- The part of the Old City the group is meant to explore has only recently been discovered beneath the Hall of Merit. This first foray will pave the way for further investigation into the Yun dynasty ruins.
- The Mountain Cloud Empress is a controversial figure in Yongjing history, both romanticized and reviled. The Yun dynasty ended when the starving common folk stormed the palace and removed the empress from power.

#### The Ministry of Finance

When the party arrives at the ministry offices, Zhong Yin departs to make other preparations. The scholar will meet the characters at the Hall of Merit at the center of the city when the characters are ready to depart.

The Minister of Finance, Deng Bo Huan, is straightforward but friendly. He verifies the characters' contract and pays them each their initial 1,000 gp. Deng Bo Huan is also an opportunistic schemer, and he offers the characters an additional 100 gp each if they share with him details of why the Grand Secretary hired them and what they expect to find in the Old City. If the characters refuse his proposal, the minister smiles, tells them he understands, and wishes them good luck.

## The Old City

When the characters are ready to begin their expedition, they can go to the Hall of Merit, where Zhong Yin is waiting for them. Zhong Yin leads them to an empty basement where a pair of guards flank a section of crumbled wall leading into darkness. The guards nod as they see Zhong Yin and stand out of the group's way.

Beyond the crumbled wall, a short, cramped hall leads to a stone stairway that descends to area Y1 in the Yun Dynasty Ruins. Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check can tell the stonework beyond the basement wall is many hundreds of years older than the modern Hall of Merit. Characters who have the Stonecunning trait have advantage on this check.

### General Features

The Yun dynasty ruins of the Old City have the following features:

- **Illumination.** The Old City is not illuminated, and the current occupants rely on [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) to see. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or some other means of seeing in the dark.
- **Ceilings.** The chambers in the ruins have 20-foot-high ceilings, with 10-foot-high ceilings in the tunnels that connect them.
- **Failing Magic.** Ancient magical defenses still ward the ruins. Creatures in the ruins can't use teleportation or any type of planar travel to leave the Old City; magic that creates such an effect automatically fails. Spells that enable travel to other sections of the Old City still function, though.

### Yun Dynasty Ruins Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 13.1.

#### Y1: Servants' Quarters

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Crumbling plaster walls, rotted bedding, and broken clay pots suggest this long chamber was once a series of sleeping quarters and storage spaces. Stray yellowed bones litter the dirt floor.
^44f

A character who examines the rodent-gnawed bones and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check can tell they are hundreds of years old and belonged to humans and dwarves who met violent ends.

##### Ropers

Three [ropers](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/roper.md) cling to the ceiling in the southeast part of the chamber. They shoot their tendrils at any creature that comes within 50 feet. Any spell used against the ropers that affects an area could jeopardize the box that rests on the floor beneath them.

##### Fragile Box

A wooden box in the southeast corner of the room holds a collection of well-written but worthless Yun dynasty romance novels. The box has AC 10, 3 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. If the box is destroyed, the books within it are thoroughly scorched and rendered unreadable.

If Zhong Yin sees the burned books, the scholar momentarily fears the books are the Mountain Cloud Empress's diaries but then realizes their true nature. Nevertheless, Zhong Yin encourages the party to prioritize preserving any other historical artifacts the characters come across.

##### Treasure

Cracked hair combs, earthenware teacups, and other worthless items are scattered throughout this area. A character who spends 5 minutes searching the area and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discovers a single pearl hairpin worth 300 gp.

#### Y2: Destroyed Entry

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Huge shards of wood showing traces of paint litter this area, along with rusted farm tools and ancient bones. The hard dirt floor is gouged in several places.
^454

Upon seeing the wreckage, Zhong Yin says this area must have been the former main entryway to the Yun Dynasty palace. The scholar notes that the bones likely belong to common folk who rose up in revolt and ended the Yun dynasty.

##### Hungry Ghosts

An [otyugh](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/otyugh.md) hides among the debris in the northwest corner of the room. When it notices the characters, it's excited at the prospect of a meal other than the rats that infest the ruins. The creature extends several dirty rags on its outstretched tentacles, gives a moan, and telepathically says, "We are the hungry dead. Honor us with lunch, or suffer our curse." Characters who hear the otyugh can make a DC 12 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. On a successful check, they realize something is pretending—poorly—to be a ghost. If given food or garbage, the otyugh continues to pretend to be three rag-ghosts, but it can telepathically warn the characters about the ropers in area Y1 and mentions having seen vicious spirits amid the ruins (a reference to the [wraiths](/compendium/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) in area Y5). The [otyugh](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/otyugh.md) attacks if any creature tries to enter area Y3 before the otyugh has been fed.

##### Treasure

A character who searches the debris and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a rotting courier's pack containing a spell scroll of [scrying](/compendium/spells/scrying.md) and three packets of [dust of disappearance](/compendium/items/dust-of-disappearance.md).

#### Y3: Throne Room

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Images of coiled blue dragons decorate the cracked floor tiles of this chamber, and dragon statues—some missing their heads or limbs—stand along the walls. In the middle of the room, a raised platform bears a bronze throne decorated with carved dragons holding bronze orbs.
^458

Portions of this audience chamber have crumbled, but hints of its former splendor remain.

##### Dragon Throne

The throne is fixed to the platform and can't be moved. It radiates an aura of transmutation magic to a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. A character who searches the throne and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices that one of its bronze orbs is missing. This portion of the throne is in area Y6. If it is returned to the throne, the platform holding the throne slides aside, revealing a 10-foot-square opening that leads down into area Y3a.

#### Y3a: Beneath the Throne

A hidden chamber lies beneath the throne in area Y3. When the platform slides aside, four [revenants](/compendium/bestiary/undead/revenant.md) emerge from the chamber and attack. These Undead, dressed like Yun Dynasty magistrates, were buried alive under the throne to ensure that they would protect the ruler's treasures even after death.

Additionally, Secretary Wei uses her [crystal ball of telepathy](/compendium/items/crystal-ball-of-telepathy.md) to scry on Zhong Yin soon after this area is revealed. See "Wei's Betrayal" for details.

##### Treasure

The chamber holds five cabinets carved with symbols that represent luck and long life. Four of them have the following contents: rotted documents, a suit of adamantine splint mail, [slippers of spider climbing](/compendium/items/slippers-of-spider-climbing.md), and ancient coins worth 5,000 gp.

The fifth cabinet radiates an aura of abjuration magic if [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) is cast on it. Among the carved symbols on the cabinet is a glyph created by the [symbol](/compendium/spells/symbol.md) (pain) spell. A character who searches the cabinets for traps finds and identifies the glyph with a successful DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. A creature that opens the cabinet without negating the symbol must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be [incapacitated](/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) with excruciating pain for 1 minute. Within the trapped cabinet are the diaries of the Mountain Cloud Empress, shattered flasks, and three [potions of longevity](/compendium/items/potion-of-longevity.md).

##### Development

Zhong Yin shows strangely little interest in the diaries before collecting them but eagerly seeks to examine the potions and the shattered flasks. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check realizes the scholar is clearly focused on recovering something other than the diaries. If none of the characters notice Zhong Yin's strange behavior, the scholar curses upon inspecting the potions and flasks, then mutters, "Nothing. There's no Dragon's Blessing here."

If the characters press the scholar on this, Zhong Yin brushes off their questions, encouraging the party to complete its investigation and then return to the surface. If the characters insist that Zhong Yin explain themself, either through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check, the scholar admits that they were actually searching for a magical substance called Dragon's Blessing, which is of great importance to Secretary Wei. Zhong Yin doesn't know more than that and urges the characters to question the Grand Secretary about it when they return to her.

#### Y4: Receiving Hall

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An altar and a decaying tapestry on the north wall are all that remains in this chamber.
^45e

The wooden altar here is bare and retains no hint of its former use. A character who looks behind the tapestry or who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check while investigating it discovers a mirror on the wall.

##### Hidden Mirror

Behind the tapestry is a damaged but functional [mirror of life trapping](/compendium/items/mirror-of-life-trapping.md). Eleven of the mirror's extradimensional cells have been destroyed, and only one remains intact. Any creature that pulls back the tapestry and can see the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become trapped in the mirror.

If a creature becomes trapped, the mirror frees its only other prisoner: Lio Gong, the Mountain Cloud Empress's favorite spouse.

##### Lio Gong

Lio Gong (neutral good [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) is a youthful-looking, athletic dwarf wearing coarse silk robes. When she emerges from the mirror, she's in a state of shock, but she is friendly toward those who try to communicate with her. Lio Gong speaks only an ancient dialect of Xingyu (the language of Yongjing). Zhong Yin can understand what the dwarf says if none of the characters speak Xingyu. Once she is given a moment to take everything in, Lio Gong shares the following information:

- The ruined palace was once Lio Gong's home.
- She was the favorite spouse of the Mountain Cloud Empress, the last ruler of the Yun dynasty, whose painted portrait she carries and can show the characters.
- The empress was obsessed with attaining immortality, eternal life beyond even the longevity granted by magic potions.
- Not wanting Lio Gong to grow old while she sought the key to everlasting life, the empress forced her lover to enter the mirror to await her eventual triumph.
- Before Lio Gong entered the mirror, the empress's focus on magical research had begun to consume much of the imperial treasury and was leading to unrest among the common folk.

Lio Gong knows the command word for the [mirror of life trapping](/compendium/items/mirror-of-life-trapping.md), "lanhua," and offers to share it immediately if the characters promise to escort her to whatever remains of the palace gardens (area Y6).

If asked about Dragon's Blessing, Lio Gong knows about it from her life alongside the Mountain Cloud Empress. She can share the information from the "Dragon's Blessing" section at the start of the adventure.

#### Y5: Bedchamber

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The lacquered iron frame of a huge bed stands on the north side of this room. All its other furnishings, including red curtains that once enclosed the bed on three sides, are rotted away to almost nothing.
^462

Four [wraiths](/compendium/bestiary/undead/wraith.md), spawned from royal courtiers who died when the palace was overrun, linger in and around the ruined bed. They bide their time until more than one creature enters this area, then attack.

#### Y6: Underground Garden

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This sanctuary might once have been a garden, but the only color here now comes from three green limestone rocks shaped like tall, wispy spirits. A dried-up fountain carved in the shape of three intertwined dragons stands at the center of the room.
^464

This private garden has fallen to ruin and been buried along with the rest of the Yun dynasty palace.

##### Fountain

The fountain and the three limestone sculptures give off an aura of conjuration magic discernible by a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. A search of the fountain reveals a mallet made of green limestone that radiates the same aura as the fountain and the artwork. Striking the sculptures with the mallet produces a sound like the ringing of a bell. If each of the three rocks is struck, water erupts from the dragon-fountain's mouths along with a fist-sized bronze orb (see "Treasure"). The water that fills the basin of the fountain is safe and refreshing. The first creature to drink from the fountain in a 24-hour period regains 7 (2d6) hit points.

##### Lio Gong's Vision

If the characters haven't already activated the fountain, Lio Gong does so when she comes here. When the fountain's basin is full, she touches the water. Every creature in the room witnesses a silent, smiling reflection of the Mountain Cloud Empress appear in the water as the garden springs to life. Trees and flowers erupt from the stony ground, and the air is filled with the scent of plum blossoms. For a moment, the garden is magically restored to its ancient splendor, but after 1 minute this vibrancy vanishes and the area returns to normal. Upon witnessing this, an emotional Lio Gong thanks the characters for freeing her, and—if the characters haven't already noticed it—she retrieves the bronze orb from the basin and gives it to them. If the characters haven't discovered the magical features of the throne in area Y3, she also shows them how to access the hidden chamber below. Lio Gong requests the characters escort her out of the ruins after they complete their investigation, seeking only to enjoy her remaining days.

##### Treasure

The bronze orb is the missing part of the throne in area Y3.

### Wei's Betrayal

Soon after the characters find area Y3a, Secretary Wei uses her [crystal ball of telepathy](/compendium/items/crystal-ball-of-telepathy.md) to scry on Zhong Yin. Unless the characters can see the spell's invisible sensor and dispel it, she witnesses the discovery of the [potions of longevity](/compendium/items/potion-of-longevity.md), the lack of Dragon's Blessing, and any slips Zhong Yin makes when talking about the reason for the investigation.

After this, whenever the characters decide to head for area Y1 to leave the ruins, read the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Rumbling fills the tunnels, and a tremor disturbs the nearby rubble. All goes quiet again, but now a haze of dust hangs in the air.
^469

Secretary Wei has ordered a court mage to magically collapse the stairwell leading from area Y1 to the surface. When the characters enter area Y1 again, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The result of the tremor is now clear—a great pile of rubble fills the space where the stairway once stood.
^46a

A character who searches the rubble and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check sees no reason for the collapse and suspects that tons of rock lie between the ruins and the surface. Characters who have the Stonecunning trait have advantage on this check.

### A New Way Out

Give the characters time to discuss ways to escape. Keep in mind the Old City's wards against teleportation and planar travel beyond the ruins. If the idea of contacting Secretary Wei for assistance using the spell scroll of [sending](/compendium/spells/sending.md) she gave the group doesn't come up, Zhong Yin makes that suggestion if the scroll hasn't already been used. If it has, Secretary Wei uses her [crystal ball of telepathy](/compendium/items/crystal-ball-of-telepathy.md) to contact a character after they start concocting ways to escape.

Secretary Wei informs the characters that she has been made aware of the collapse and that they shouldn't be worried—cave-ins are a known hazard of investigating the Old City. She says she's already working with court mages to create a gateway to another section of the ruins through which the characters can escape.

A few minutes later, a shimmering portal forms in front of the party. A character who makes a successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check knows this is a one-way portal, but the destination can't be seen through the magical passage.

## Secret Grotto

Characters who step through the portal are transported to another portion of the Old City in the northeast section of Yongjing.

### General Features

The areas in this underground grotto have the following features:

- **Illumination.** The glowing jade in area S1 fills that area with dim light. Lanterns holding [continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md) spells line the walls of the other areas.
- **Ceilings.** Ceilings throughout the grotto are 15 feet high except in area S1, where they're 30 feet high.
- **Failing Magic.** Creatures in the ruins can't use teleportation or any type of planar travel to leave the Old City; magic that creates such an effect automatically fails. Spells that enable travel to other sections of Old City (whether elsewhere in the secret grotto or back to the Yun dynasty ruins) still function, though.

### Secret Grotto Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 13.2.

#### S1: Jade Golem Tomb

Characters who pass through the portal appear in the center of this area. When all the characters have arrived, read the following:

> The walls of this hexagonal stone chamber are shot through with pale white veins of faintly glowing jade. A bronze double door bearing a design of two ki-rins stands in one wall. Dozens of alcoves holding jade statues of soldiers line the rest of the chamber's perimeter. Bodies are scattered around the room—some clothed in finery, some in rags, all in states of decay.
^470

Secretary Wei uses this ancient trap to dispose of those she considers a threat to the empire. She now considers the characters such threats, no matter how little they know about her plans or Dragon's Blessing.

Any investigation of the bodies in the room reveals them to be humans and dwarves, some only a few months deceased. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check determines that most of the victims were killed by giant blades.

##### A Final Courtesy

As the characters get their bearings, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A shimmering, illusory image of Secretary Wei appears in the center of the chamber. "Your service is much appreciated, adventurers," the image says grimly. "But you've learned just enough to be dangerous. I won't allow our great nation to succumb to the same chaos as the Yun dynasty. If you have last wishes, please write them down. We will retrieve them and do our best to honor them after your demise."
> 
> The Grand Secretary then hesitates, and the image wavers. "Zhong Yin, I will not be retrieving you as planned," she says. "I am sorry."
> 
> The image flickers, then vanishes.
^472

Any attempt to respond to Secretary Wei fails, as she ignores the characters.

##### Zhong Yin

Zhong Yin is shocked at Secretary Wei's betrayal. From this point on, the spy is willing to aid the characters and will share any information in the "What's Left Unsaid" section earlier in the adventure.

##### Stone Defenders

After the image of Secretary Wei fades, a sculpted soldier detaches from its alcove, then steps forward to attack. The soldier uses the [stone golem](/compendium/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) stat block, except that its Slam action deals slashing damage because it wields a giant glaive.

At the start of the soldier's next turn, a second stone soldier animates and attacks. This soldier is identical, except that the designs on its armor are slightly different. Each time one of the stone soldiers is destroyed, another activates in its alcove and attacks at the start of the next turn. No more than two soldiers are ever active at once.

The soldiers continue to animate and attack until the bronze gate is opened (see below). Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher notice that different animal designs decorate each of the statues.

##### Bronze Gate

Magic seals this bronze double door. It opens only if the ki-rin symbol on one of the statues in the room—the only statue that doesn't animate—is pressed. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) notices that all the jade statues have distinct designs suggestive of different animals on their armor and that these designs are rendered in a style similar to the ki-rin symbol on the doors. A character who takes an action to further scrutinize these designs or looks for a ki-rin symbol on the statues can make a DC 18 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. On a failed check, the character investigates a few statues and doesn't see anything remarkable. On a successful check, the character notices that the decorations on the statue ten alcoves south of the door matches the ki-rin symbol on the gate. If a creature touches the symbol on that statue, the gate opens, and all currently animate statues return to their alcoves and deactivate.

#### S2: Hallway Alcoves

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A long hallway is roughly carved out of the surrounding rock. Lanterns embedded in the walls cast light into a number of irregularly shaped alcoves.
^477

Secretary Wei uses this area as a storage place for valuables that might be useful in the future. A character who spends 5 minutes searching the alcoves finds numerous files detailing years-old court proceedings and one of the following objects at random:

- An empty carrying case with a dozen compartments. A tag reads "[Potion of Longevity](/compendium/items/potion-of-longevity.md) × 12."
- A [wind fan](/compendium/items/wind-fan.md) painted with an image of flat-bottomed ships. A tag identifies it as a gift for one of the emperor's children.
- Three fragile porcelain vases worth 800 gp each. A receipt identifies them as gifts for the emperor.

#### S3: Documents Alcove

This alcove has shelves cut out of the sandstone, each one stacked high with scrolls. Characters who search the shelves and succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check find a series of scrolls with orders from Secretary Wei and reports back from her agents. These documents capture the following information:

- Secretary Wei believes the emperor is dying.
- She has secretly been sending agents to ancient imperial sites across the land to search for something called Dragon's Blessing (the document doesn't note what this is).
- Finding Dragon's Blessing will save the emperor.
- Maintaining secrecy is of the utmost importance, lest the imperial court be thrown into chaos.

Any resident of Yongjing or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check knows that the nation's rulers use magic to give themselves long life and ensure the stability of the land. If the imperial line has lost the ability to do this, upheaval is sure to follow.

#### S4: Dragon Grotto

As the characters approach this area, they hear the ragged breathing of a large creature.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An enormous gold dragon lies coiled against the near wall of this gloomy chamber, its four legs shackled to the ground. Claw marks score the walls and floor.
> 
> Several workstations are carved into the eastern wall, each covered in alchemical devices. Muttering figures cluster around these stations. Four simple cots stand nearby.
^47a

Imperial alchemists work in secret here, trying to recreate the lost secrets of Dragon's Blessing. Passages lead to the west and northeast.

##### Gold Dragon

An [adult gold dragon](/compendium/bestiary/dragon/adult-gold-dragon.md) named Tulao has been a captive of a secret cabal of imperial alchemists for over a year. He has 5 levels of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) and 20 hit points remaining. Magic shackles on his legs prevent him from using any of his actions. The dragon is hostile to his captors but friendly toward anyone who removes his shackles. The shackles can be removed either by using one of the mages' keys or by picking the lock with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md). Freeing Tulao reduces his [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) by 1 level. If freed, Tulao thanks the characters and shares the information in the "Secrets of Longevity" section below before transforming into a canary and flying out of the chamber through area S5.

##### Mages

Three [mages](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) work here. They are lawful evil and serve Secretary Wei as the dragon's handlers. They're hostile toward any creature that's not another agent of Secretary Wei. Each of them carries a jade key that opens the dragon's shackles and will do anything to prevent the dragon from being released.

##### Secret of Longevity

If Tulao is freed or if any of the mages are captured and coerced, they explain what's happening here, highlighting the following points:

- They can share all of the information in the "Dragon's Blessing" and "End of the Emperor" sections at the start of the adventure.
- Secretary Wei had the imperial mages magically capture and bind the gold dragon, hoping that her alchemists could use it to create Dragon's Blessing. Their efforts have met with no success.

##### Treasure

The workstations here hold two [potions of healing (supreme)](/compendium/items/potion-of-supreme-healing.md), an [elixir of health](/compendium/items/elixir-of-health.md), several gold dragon scales, and three sets of [alchemist's supplies](/compendium/items/alchemists-supplies.md).

#### S5: Exit Tunnel

A cobweb-filled passageway leads out and up from the grotto, quickly becoming a steep slope with metal rungs bolted to the sandstone walls. The passageway ends in an iron grate that requires a successful DC 12 Strength check to push open. If Tulao escaped using this route, he has already slipped through the grate and out of the crawlspace beyond by the time the characters arrive.

## Surprise Audience

When the characters emerge from the hatch, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The space beyond is a windowless room with a wooden ceiling only four feet off the floor and a trapdoor at its center. A smiling mask with peeling paint lies on the floor. From above comes the sound of someone singing an operatic aria.
^481

The characters are in the crawlspace beneath the stage of the Pear Garden Imperial Opera. The room has no doors, but the trapdoor in the ceiling can be pulled down to provide access to the stage above.

### An Unexpected Cameo

Read the following if the characters open the door and climb up onto the stage, or if they unexpectedly emerge in some other manner:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Two singers wearing heavy makeup freeze in mid-embrace as you make your presence known. At the back of the stage, musicians stare in shock but continue playing.
> 
> The audience area beyond is a profusion of colorful parasols held by people wearing expensive clothes, all watching the performance with rapt attention.
> 
> Sitting on a raised dais in the center of the crowd is the [White Jade Emperor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/white-jade-emperor-jttrc.md), dressed in magnificent yellow and gold robes. Several guards stand nearby.
^483

The emperor's dais is 30 feet from the front of the stage. The emperor's guards notice any disturbance immediately, and two [mages](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) and five [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) move to surround the emperor. They order the characters to lay down their weapons and submit themselves for arrest.

If a character addresses the emperor, the ruler raises his hand and the guards pause. If no character does so, Zhong Yin calls to the emperor, and he prevents the guards from arresting the group.

Characters should be encouraged not to attack the emperor or his guards, but if they do, more [mages](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) and [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) join the fight until the characters are taken into custody, soon to be exiled from the city.

### Conversing with the Emperor

With a few imperious words, the [White Jade Emperor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/white-jade-emperor-jttrc.md) (lawful neutral, hill dwarf [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) dismisses everyone except his guards. As the crowd disperses, Secretary Wei remains on the scene. As soon as the area is empty of opera-goers, he orders the characters to explain themselves.

#### Presenting Evidence

The emperor listens patiently to the characters' story. He believes their tale if they can support it with any three of the following pieces of evidence:

- The documents to and from Secretary Wei found in area S3
- The confession of one of the alchemists from area S4
- The [potions of longevity](/compendium/items/potion-of-longevity.md) the characters found in the Old City
- A gold dragon scale from area S4

Zhong Yin's confession also counts as a piece of evidence, but the spy is reluctant to betray the Grand Secretary. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can compel Zhong Yin to fully confess.

Additionally, a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can convince the emperor to believe them even if they present only two pieces of evidence.

The emperor will not allow the characters to reenter the Old City to search for additional evidence.

#### The Emperor Is Not Convinced

If the characters aren't able to convince the emperor of the truth of their story through presenting evidence, he asks Secretary Wei what she has to say about the situation. The secretary flatly denies the accusation, claiming that Zhong Yin and the characters were sent on a scholarly investigation into the Old City, but stole relics from the site and eluded her attempts to capture and punish them.

The emperor accepts her answer as the truth of the matter. Unless the characters come up with a compelling way to convince the emperor that Secretary Wei is lying, he gives them and Zhong Yin one hour to exile themselves from the city before his guards compel them to do so. Continue with "Conclusion" below.

#### The Emperor Is Convinced

If the emperor believes the characters' story, he finds the evidence against Secretary Wei irrefutable. Nevertheless, in her defense, the secretary shares the information from the "End of an Era" section at the start of the adventure, claiming that she sought to protect not only the emperor but the stability of the empire. She'll go on to calmly answer any questions the characters have, revealing any details from the "Secrets of Immortality" section. She clearly believes what she says and considers her actions to be in the best interests of the empire.

After Secretary Wei has spoken on her own behalf, the emperor dismisses the characters and those with them, but he tells the secretary to stay for a private audience. This session ends with the Grand Secretary being taken into custody by the imperial guard.

## Conclusion

If the characters are exiled, they are never welcomed back in Yongjing while the [White Jade Emperor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/white-jade-emperor-jttrc.md) rules. Zhong Yin leaves the party's company as soon as possible.

If the characters convinced the emperor of Secretary Wei's schemes, they—along with Zhong Yin—are invited to a private audience with the emperor a day later. The emperor rewards each character with 1,000 gp, plus another 1,000 gp if they promise not to speak of what they have learned about Dragon's Blessing and his eventual death. If the characters break their promise, rumors spread quickly, but the emperor does not seek to punish the characters.

Before dismissing the characters, the emperor goes on to ask what they think he should do with Secretary Wei, who has served the nation well for decades and whose schemes seemed driven by a desire to keep the empire safe—even if she did keep his impending death a secret. He favors exiling her but will consider whatever the characters propose.

### A Rare Sighting

As the party leaves their audience with the emperor, characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 12 or higher catch a glimpse of a rare, fortuitous omen: the shadow of a serpentine dragon—like the mythical Dragon of Heavenly Blessings—soaring through the clouds. All the characters, whether they saw this omen or not, gain the following charm (a type of "supernatural gift" detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

#### Way of the Dragon

You are as elusive and free as the Dragon of Heavenly Blessings. This charm has 6 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge and gain one of the following benefits:

- "Difficult terrain" doesn't cost you extra movement until the end of your next long rest.
- The next time you end your turn [paralyzed](/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) or [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained), that condition ends on you. This benefit then ends.

After you expend a charge, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Once all its charges have been expended, the charm vanishes from you.

## Yongjing Gazetteer

For centuries, the nation of Great Xing has been synonymous with power and prestige, with no finer example than the country's glorious capital: Yongjing. The city teems with scholars, bureaucrats, artisans, and performers. But Yongjing was not always so vibrant. Beneath the fine floor tiles and immaculate garden paths lie the remains of prior dynasties and their long-dead citizens—concealing a turbulent past marked by war, subjugation, and famine.

The rule of the Xing dynasty has brought wealth, stability, and peace to Great Xing. But now the imperial secret of longevity has been exhausted, which means the [White Jade Emperor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/white-jade-emperor-jttrc.md)'s long reign will end soon. The Grand Secretary who governs Great Xing according to the emperor's command knows that it's only a matter of time before word of the emperor's impending death gets out and the stability of the empire is put to the test.

### Yongjing Features

Those familiar with Yongjing know the following details:

- **Hallmarks.** Yongjing is known for its courtly drama and labyrinthine bureaucracy. Its rulers enjoy exceptionally long lifespans.
- **People.** Humans and dwarves make up most of the population of Yongjing, with humans outnumbering dwarves three to one. Almost all residents have black hair, warm skin tones, and rounded faces.
- **Languages.** Xingyu is the primary language of Yongjing, and most residents are also fluent in Common. Xingyu is written in the Dwarvish script, though scholars and upper-class citizens often also learn the language's older and more complicated pictograph representations.

### Noteworthy Sites

The city of Yongjing is a bustling network of tightly packed buildings and narrow alleys. A wide central avenue bisects the city and connects the grand palaces of the emperor's court through a series of plazas.

#### Hall of Divine Wisdom

Each morning, the Gate of Ascendance is thrown open, and petitioners seeking the ear of the emperor crowd onto the plaza in front of the palace known as the Hall of Divine Wisdom. Ministers interview each petitioner—and swiftly reject requests too trivial to warrant the emperor's involvement. The plaza is also a prime location for pickpockets and spies. Most days, wealthy petitioners are turned away and must seek other means to solve their problems.

#### Inner Butterfly Court

The north side of the city is taken up by the palaces of the royal court, which make up their own district—the Inner Butterfly Court. Only the emperor's family and their attendants are permitted in this area, and most residents rarely leave the district except for opera performances and holiday festivals.

Spousal palaces line the east and west sides of the Inner Butterfly Court, each building the residence of a royal spouse and their children. Two larger central palaces are occupied by the emperor, who resides in the Palace of Heavenly Command and reserves the Palace of Favored Unity for visits with his expansive family.

#### Kiln District

The southwest part of Yongjing houses hundreds of earthen kilns, where the famed white-and-blue porcelain of Great Xing is painted and fired. Potters work in assembly lines to meet a quota of hundreds of pieces a day, with twenty percent of those pieces going to the emperor. Xing porcelain fetches exorbitant prices in foreign markets, so armed guards accompany every shipment that leaves the city. At the Office of Authenticity, imperial artificers apply intricate identifying marks to each piece. Despite this, counterfeiting is a constant problem.

#### The Old City

Over the centuries, the rulers of Yongjing have expanded and updated the city, building on top of existing architecture. As a result, many structures conceal forgotten chambers, hidden passages, dusty traps, and ancient artifacts beneath their floors. Expeditions into the subterranean Old City are common, whether staged officially on behalf of the emperor or undertaken in secret by criminals and treasure hunters.

### Life in Yongjing

Residents of Yongjing take great pride in their city and frequently boast about everything from its venerable age and historic architecture to its lack of unsavory elements—such as the rats and diseases that are so common in other, lesser cities.

#### Chasing Longevity

The importance of a long life is drilled into children from an early age. The folk of the empire and Yongjing proudly consider their society a meritocracy, where anyone can work hard and rise above their current station—provided they live long enough. Therefore, citizens maintain healthy lifestyles, drink medicinal teas, and carry symbols of longevity such as long-lived animals or plants.

#### Court Intrigue and Succession

In the imperial court, tradition dictates that the social standing of each member of the emperor's family is determined by the preferences of the emperor. If the emperor publicly favors one spouse over another, the pecking order is reset accordingly, and everyone must quickly adjust their behavior to recognize this new hierarchy.

At no time is an emperor's favor in greater question than when they die. Rarely do Yongjing's long-lived rulers have to consider the prospect of death, and they put even less consideration into designating a particular heir from among their shorter-lived family members. When an emperor dies unexpectedly, a period of squabbling follows, as imperial family members, secret offspring, and pretenders produce evidence of being the past emperor's favorite. These squabbles ultimately devolve into secret wars, as the Inner Butterfly Court becomes beset by intrigue, assassinations, and disappearances until a single heir claims and holds the throne for a year's time. Only then is that individual universally accepted as the new emperor.

#### Delicious Bounty

A typical meal in Yongjing might include sweet or savory buns, salty pork, and stir-fried dandelion leaves. Wintertime stews are flavored with bone marrow and laden with sliced lotus root, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. In summer, Yongjing's courtyard gardens are filled to bursting with oranges, lychees, plums, and peaches.

#### Fashion and Society

Clothing in Yongjing favors loose and flowing styles—and the wealthier the wearer, the more elaborate the embroidery. Ministers are identifiable by their black winged caps, while members of the royal family wear elaborate headdresses.

The households of city residents are built around the clan, made up of several generations of family members and multiple spouses of any gender, typically joined through arranged marriages. A clear hierarchy within each of these complex familial structures helps to facilitate social harmony. Members of a clan keep close eyes on one another, because the deeds of an individual affect the social standing of the clan as a whole.

#### Grand Dynasty

Yongjing is the governmental center of the flourishing Xing dynasty. At the top sits the [White Jade Emperor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/white-jade-emperor-jttrc.md), the third since the rise of the Xing dynasty. Like nearly all the previous monarchs, the emperor is a dwarf, with a life span long enough to have experienced the cyclical nature of history firsthand—a trait considered necessary to rule.

#### Imperial Service

Most of Yongjing's bureaucrats are humans. A Grand Secretary appointed by the emperor leads the Octadic Council, a group made up of the leaders of the city's eight Ministries: Agriculture, Arcana, Bureaucracy, Culture, Diplomacy, Finance, Imperial Lineage, and Public Works. A position in one of the bustling ministry offices is the most prestigious employment in Great Xing, promising lifelong access to luxury and elevated status for an entire family. Children from all backgrounds study for the annual Imperial Exams, hoping to score high enough to be selected to fill a vacancy. Those who show aptitude for more clandestine work might be selected to join the ranks of the Imperial Ghosts, versatile soldiers who serve as spies for the empire.

#### Names

Names in Great Xing are ungendered and place an individual's family name before their personal name. Personal names are formed of two words; the first is usually determined by birth order, social status, or rank, and the second is an aspirational or lucky name representing the parents' hopes for their child. The following names are common in Xing:

- **Family Names.** Jia, Ke, Li, Song, Sun, Tai, Tian, Xing (royal family only)
- **Status.** Bo (firstborn), Meng (firstborn), Xia (second-born), Zhong (second-born), Shu (third-born), Ji (fourth-born or more), Jun (noble), Si (heir), Wen (scholar)
- **Aspirational.** Jie (heroic), Mei (charming), Ming (bright), Qian (rising), Tong (leader), Yi (virtuous), Zi (gentle)

### Legends of Yongjing

Countless stories recount the country's illustrious beginnings, when a great dragon, one of three majestic siblings, descended from the heavens to establish the culture that would become Great Xing. The area in which the city of Yongjing would one day rise was originally populated by nomadic dwarf shepherds. As humans immigrated to the region, conflict between the races broke out. Legends say that the violence persisted for a century, until the Dragon of Heavenly Blessings who had founded Great Xing returned. Descending from the clouds, the great dragon bowed before a young dwarf leader, bestowing on him the ability to inspire and unify folk of both human and dwarven ancestries. This dwarf became the Yellow Dragon Emperor, founder of the nation's first ruling dynasty.

Numerous dwarven dynasties have ruled Great Xing, with the human population generally content to be so governed. One fable, however, tells of the Winter Crane Empress, who was dethroned by a human. As the story goes, three of her advisors came forward with three different plans for war, but the exiled dwarf empress instead called for a sumptuous bed to be made for her. She then took a nap until the usurper died of old age, reclaiming her throne without violence and swiftly undoing the little he could accomplish in his brief human life span.

^yongjing-adventures

### Characters from Yongjing

If players want to create characters from Yongjing, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**Do you have family connections to the emperor?** Do you use those connections to make your life easier, or do you conceal them to reduce the threat of assassinations or intrigue?

**What personal symbol of longevity do you carry?** Is it an elephant, a turtle, or another long-lived animal, or perhaps ever-growing bamboo or some other ageless plant? If you don't carry a symbol, why is that?

**Do you serve the empire in some official means?** Do you serve as a bureaucrat, having passed the Imperial Exams? Are you one of the emperor's defenders? Or have you left such service behind?
