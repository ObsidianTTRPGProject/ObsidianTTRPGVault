# Wages of Vice
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel* 

_An Adventure for 5th-Level Characters_

When they stumble upon a murder, the characters are caught up in the plots of a vengeful killer targeting the heirs of the city of Zinda's rulers. During the boisterous citywide festival known as March of Vice, the characters must find the killer and reveal the fiendish power that serves her.

## Background

The wealth of Zinda is defined by the jeli flower. This opalescent moonflower has graceful pink leaves and wide petals, and it's used to produce a sweet black wine. The flower was brought to the land several years ago and flourished, now growing exclusively around Zinda.

The March of Vice festival originally honored the city's entire wine trade, but jeli wine has recently become the focus of the centuries-old tradition. Zinda's recent prosperity hides a dire secret, however. Five years ago, the Kings of Coin—Zinda's rulers—established a covenant with a witch named Proud Edun. She used her magic to create the jeli flower, a crop with fantastic commercial value. In exchange, the six Kings of Coin were to give her their firstborn children to serve as apprentices. At the suggestion of one of their members, [Myx Nargis Ruba](/compendium/bestiary/npc/myx-nargis-ruba-jttrc.md), the Kings of Coin betrayed Proud Edun and murdered her instead of giving up their heirs.

For five years, the Kings of Coin have reaped the benefits of Zinda's prosperity, and Proud Edun's daughter, [Kala Mabarin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kala-mabarin-jttrc.md), has plotted her revenge.

### Setting the Adventure

Use the following suggestions to help contextualize Zinda in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters traveling from the Radiant Citadel arrive in a jungle clearing 2 miles from Zinda's walls. Use the "Zinda Gazetteer" section at this adventure's end to provide further details about the surrounding lands.
- **Forgotten Realms.** A trade city known for its wealth and magic, Zinda could find a home along the coasts of Amn or near Dambrath.
- **Greyhawk.** Zinda might be found among the Holds of the Sea Princes or in the Lordship of the Isles.

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure:

- **Celebration.** Zinda's March of Vice is famous throughout the region. An influential ally of the characters requests they attend and, while they're there, purchase a bottle of jeli wine to be used as a gift in a diplomatic negotiation.
- **Obvious Suspects.** The heirs of Zinda's rulers have been targeted by a murderer. Captain Adann, a leader of Zinda's anti-aristocrat group called the Bloodletters, seeks the characters' help in preventing blame from falling on his organization.
- **Old Secrets.** Madame [Samira Arah](/compendium/bestiary/npc/samira-arah-jttrc.md), one of Zinda's rulers, believes her fellow Kings of Coin are engaged in a deadly conspiracy. Through an anonymous agent, Samira hires the characters to come to Zinda and uncover what secrets her peers hide.

## Starting the Adventure

The adventure begins with the characters traveling through the rain forest near Zinda, following a caravan of merchants. Read the following description to set the scene:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Heat rises from the jungle floor and clings to the broad leaves in the canopy above. Ahead, an elephant sways drowsily. Its rider groans and stretches, and then rejoins the ululating marching chant.
> 
> As the forest thins, the gleaming gates of the trade city of Zinda appear a mile ahead.
^168

The road through the jungle is narrow, forcing the caravan to march single file along its trails. The other travelers are in high spirits, offering food and water to anyone who needs it. They also share the following information:

- The March of Vice is a ten-day festival of drinking, debauchery, shows, and sales.
- Revelers wearing feathered masks and beaded gowns make merry through day and night in celebration of the city's prosperity.
- The travelers can also share any details about Zinda from the "Zinda Gazetteer" section at the end of this adventure.

## The River of Gold

The trail from the northwest widens as it reaches the city, feeding into the River of Gold, a thoroughfare paved with yellow potsherds. The caravanners cheer loudly as they enter the fields around the city and the bustling community comes fully into view. At Zinda's open gates, agents of the city collect a toll of 5 sp per entrant or goods of equal value. The tax collectors are in good spirits, so a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can convince a tax collector to allow the group free entry.

As the characters enter the city, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Beyond the city gates, the golden road continues amid silk-draped booths and squat buildings with conical roofs. The chatter of merchants and cheerful youths rings out along the road. Folk sell colorful flowers, beaded charms, and other wares from woven baskets atop their heads, while street performers spin in tight circles, waving long silk streamers.
^16a

Hundreds of revelers, merchants, jeli wine vendors, and entertainers pack the River of Gold. Buildings bear brightly painted signs and are covered with colorful vines bearing lush flowers. Beyond the crowds, the characters can see the bustling city center called the Court of Flowers, lined with tropical trees whose branches droop to the pavement.

### A Grim Discovery

As the characters make their way from the River of Gold to the Court of Flowers, they pass a shadowed alley. Glancing down it, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score sees a still figure surrounded by spilled gold coins and slumped against the wall, head tilted to stare at them.

Characters who investigate find a dead dwarf wearing lavish robes. Nearby are 20 gp fallen from an open pouch the dwarf wears. His body shows no wounds, but a character who makes a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check finds signs of poison. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character confirms that the dwarf was killed by [burnt othur fumes](/compendium/items/burnt-othur-fumes.md) ("a poison detailed" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). The dwarf has been dead for 5 minutes and thus is beyond the help of a [revivify](/compendium/spells/revivify.md) spell.

Characters who search the alley confirm it is a dead end, and the shop doors along it are all locked. There is no sign of any other creature in the area.

The characters currently have no way of learning that the dwarf was murdered by the vengeful [Kala Mabarin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kala-mabarin-jttrc.md), who got close enough to him in the crowd to poison him, then led him to the alley to die.

### Guilt by Association

Before the characters conclude their investigation of the body and the alley, three [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) wearing gold filigreed armor shout for the characters to stay where they are, attacking if the characters flee. These veterans were hired by Madame [Samira Arah](/compendium/bestiary/npc/samira-arah-jttrc.md), the newest member of the Kings of Coin, to protect the dwarf, but they lost sight of him during the celebrations.

The alley is only 10 feet wide. Each veteran fights until reduced to 10 hit points, then flees. The veterans stand down if all the characters surrender or if a character uses an action to explain they had nothing to with the dwarf's death and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. A character has disadvantage on this check if the group has wounded any of the veterans.

### First Blood

After the last veteran is defeated or once the veterans stand down, read the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A tall elf woman wearing a sumptuous gown appears at the mouth of the alley, shaking her head. "Jacopo, you fool, I hope your last March of Vice was worth it."
> 
> A smile touches her lips as she takes you in. "These guards are members of the Silent Verse, protectors in my employ. I apologize for their overzealousness. Seeing how you handle yourselves, though, I might be able to better apologize with an offer of employment."
^16e

The woman introduces herself as Madame [Samira Arah](/compendium/bestiary/npc/samira-arah-jttrc.md), the newest member of Zinda's ruling council, the Kings of Coin (see the "Zinda Gazetteer" section).

### Madame Samira Arah

Madame [Samira Arah](/compendium/bestiary/npc/samira-arah-jttrc.md) (neutral, elf [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)) joined the Kings of Coin within the last year. She was the chosen heir of the King of Coin she replaced but not part of their family (an important detail as it relates to [Kala Mabarin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kala-mabarin-jttrc.md)'s vengeance). Her peers' embrace of the status quo frustrates her grand plans for making Zinda even more prosperous. Samira plots to usurp the leadership of the Kings of Coin from Grand Messer Amos Nir and claim rulership of the city. Samira is sharp and severe, and she presents herself as haughty and imperturbable.

#### Personality Trait

"I deserve only the best."

#### Ideal

"Someone must always command. Why not the one with the most ambition?"

#### Bond

"The common folk are sheep to be led, and I am the capable shepherd."

#### Flaw

"Why should I settle for less than everything?"

### Samira's Offer

Samira instructs any remaining veterans to deal with Jacopo's body quietly and to alert the other Kings of Coin. She then leads the characters to a small café at the edge of the city's central market, where she has a private room. After offering the characters jeli wine, she explains who she is and answers their questions. Use the following details to guide the conversation:

- Madame [Samira Arah](/compendium/bestiary/npc/samira-arah-jttrc.md) is the head of the Jewelers' Trade, the guild for those who craft and deal in gems and jewelry.
- Due to her experience protecting the valuable assets of her guild, she also acts as the security specialist for the Kings of Coin, controlling enforcers known as the Silent Verse.
- The murder victim is Jacopo Ain, eldest son of King of Coin Massimo Ain.
- Jacopo was under protective guard in response to a recent attack against the family member of another King of Coin. But he slipped past his guardians, intent on reveling amid the March of Vice.
- Last night, Zenia Ruba—the eldest daughter of [Myx Nargis Ruba](/compendium/bestiary/npc/myx-nargis-ruba-jttrc.md), another of the Kings of Coin—was attacked and nearly killed. Samira doesn't know if the attacks are related but fears they might be.

Samira wants to hire the characters to question Zenia and discover any information tying her attack and Jacopo's murder to Grand Messer Amos. Though she controls the Silent Verse, Samira fears some of its agents are loyal to Amos. A group of capable adventurers seeking information might yield the results she needs. In return for their assistance, Samira offers the characters 200 gp each. She's a shrewd bargainer but can be coaxed to increase her offer to 300 gp each if a character succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

If the characters agree to Samira's terms, she warns them to be discreet. The Kings of Coin took great pains to keep the attack on Zenia quiet for fear of jeopardizing the success of the March of Vice. Jacopo's death will likewise be concealed until the festival is over. She then provides directions to an establishment owned by Zenia's family, a tavern called the Thornapple, where Zenia is under guard. Zenia's directions avoid several streets closed by festivities and lead through the city market.

Samira also gives the characters a rose-shaped token that confirms the characters are her representatives. She tells them she will be among the celebrants on the city's main thoroughfare, the River of Gold, until the March of Vice begins.

## On the Hunt

Seeking Zenia at the Thornapple gives the characters their first opportunity to explore Zinda. With the March of Vice occurring soon, people are in high spirits. Characters who move about the crowds, visit local vendors, or seek to learn more about recent events in Zinda each hear a rumor from the Zinda Rumors table. Each rumor also notes whether it is true or false.

**Zinda Rumors**

| dice: d6 | Rumor |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | A witch is keen to collect coven members from the heirs and families of the Kings of Coin. (False) |
| 2 | Foul spirits known as biza haunt the forest and sometimes tempt innocent souls with secrets of evil magic. (True) |
| 3 | The March of Vice is an opportunity to cast off past mistakes and start anew. (True) |
| 4 | A half-wolf, half-human figure wanders the streets at night. This figure looks strikingly similar to Grand Messer Amos Nir, but the Kings of Coin refuse to investigate. (False) |
| 5 | A diviner revealed that the firstborn children of the Kings of Coin are in danger of having their souls stolen for mysterious reasons. (True) |
| 6 | Grand Messer Amos Nir plans to retire imminently and will name his son, Azra, to lead the Kings of Coin in his place. (True) |
^zinda-rumors

### Mayhem in the Market

As the characters move through the market, a stocky woman in green pantaloons and a yellow tunic irritably elbows her way past them. This is [Kala Mabarin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kala-mabarin-jttrc.md)—one of Zinda's spirit shepherds, known as daturas—who has returned to the city after years of living alone in the jungle. Kala moves hurriedly through the crowd. Aside from her rudeness, there's nothing remarkable about Kala at the moment, but characters who notice her now might recall spotting her later when they hear descriptions of the woman. The milling crowd stymies characters who try to pursue Kala, even as a more pressing distraction arises.

The characters won't realize it yet, but Kala has just targeted another scion of the Kings of Coin, Arel Avim. She has used a poison of her own design to make an innocent merchant attack the local lordling.

#### Kala Mabarin

[Kala Mabarin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kala-mabarin-jttrc.md) (neutral evil, human [druid](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md)) is a skilled herbalist and datura, a protector of the spirits of the land. After years in the wilderness, she has returned to Zinda intent on vengeance. Kala entered into a pact with a biza, a type of vengeful spirit versed in sinister magic. In exchange for Kala murdering people for the biza to feed on, the spirit taught her how to make a powerful poison to facilitate her revenge. Now Kala uses what she has learned to placate the biza and wreak havoc on the Kings of Coin who murdered her mother—particularly targeting their adult, firstborn heirs. Her deep rage at the Kings of Coin and Zinda is rivaled only by her joyful reverence for the spiritual world.

#### Breath of Vengeance

Moments after Kala pushes past the characters, read the following text:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Shrieks of fear rise from an herb vendor's stall nearby. The crowd shifts as panicked people flee the scene.
^17a

The characters see the herbalist who works the stall coughing as he attacks a man on the ground. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher also notice a dissipating pink cloud around the figures.

Seeing this, the horrified crowd stampedes. Each character in the market must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the crush.

##### Poisoned Merchant

The merchant uses the [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) stat block, except his only weapon is a makeshift club—treat it as a longsword that deals bludgeoning damage. He initially focuses his attack on the fallen man but randomly attacks any creature within reach. The merchant has been affected by a poison made by Kala called [biza's breath](/compendium/items/bizas-breath-jttrc.md) (see the sidebar). A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check notices that the man's glassy eyes and puppet-like movement suggest he has been drugged in some way. A [protection from poison](/compendium/spells/protection-from-poison.md) spell or similar magic ends the effect on the merchant.

##### Victim

The man the merchant is attacking is named Arel Avim. He uses the [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) stat block, has 0 hit points, and is dying.

#### After the Attack

Once the merchant is dealt with, several people move to help the wounded man, Arel Avim. One of them is Captain Adann, who has neatly trimmed facial hair and wears a red vest. He's a leader of the anti-aristocrat group called the Bloodletters. Before the party can get Arel back on his feet, several soldiers sweep in and take him and the merchant into custody. These soldiers wear the same gold filigreed armor as the Silent Verse members the characters encountered earlier.

If asked, Captain Adann explains that the wounded man is Arel Avim, son of the King of Coin Messer Solenn Avim. Arel is sympathetic to the Bloodletters' cause, much to his father's disapproval. Adann can also share any information from the "Zinda Gazetteer" section about the Bloodletters. Ultimately, the Bloodletters aren't involved with the attack on Arel.

If the characters ask Adann or others about a figure wearing green and yellow hurrying away from the scene, several people report seeing such a person near the herbalist's cart just before she bumped into the characters, but she is long gone. If the characters didn't notice Kala earlier, Adann mentions seeing someone matching her description behaving suspiciously just before the attack.

> [!quote] Biza's Breath (Inhaled)
> 
> A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no other creature within its reach, the [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature does nothing on its turn. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
^bizas-breath-inhaled

### The Thornapple

Once things are under control in the market, the characters can continue to the Thornapple. When they enter, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Although the building is packed with people, the Thornapple's baked clay walls create a cool interior. Dozens of tables are filled, and a huge stage across from the entrance is being set for a performance. From behind a long, well-stocked bar, a comfortably dressed orc gives an enthusiastic wave and says, "Welcome friends, and a blessed March of Vice to you! How can your cousin Nargis help you tonight?"
^180

The tavern's proprietor, [Myx Nargis Ruba](/compendium/bestiary/npc/myx-nargis-ruba-jttrc.md), entertains customers from behind the bar.

Characters who survey the crowd and succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check note several armed figures focusing more on the tavern patrons than their drinks. These are guards of the Silent Verse assigned by Samira to watch over Nargis and Zenia.

#### Myx Nargis Ruba

[Myx Nargis Ruba](/compendium/bestiary/npc/myx-nargis-ruba-jttrc.md) (neutral evil, orc [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) is one of Zenia's parents and also a King of Coin. Nargis is overseer of the Tavern Keepers Trade and spends much of their time at the Thornapple, the centerpiece of their family's fortune.

When the Kings of Coin made their bargain with the witch Proud Edun to magically cultivate the jeli flower, Nargis convinced the other Kings of Coin they could save their firstborn children by murdering the witch. For five years, Nargis took great pride in the city's success, but the attack on Zenia threatens to expose their lies.

Nargis is a stylishly dressed, middle-aged orc with a stout build. They switch between a posh Zindanese accent and a laborer's gruff lilt depending on whom they talk to.

##### Personality Trait

"I consider all to be my dearest companions unless proven wrong three—perhaps four—times."

##### Ideal

"Family is more important than all the gold in Zinda."

##### Bond

"I would cheat and kill to keep my daughter with me, but I fear I will lose her as a result."

##### Flaw

"I have taken the easy way out before, and I would happily do it again."

#### Nargis's Story

[Myx Nargis Ruba](/compendium/bestiary/npc/myx-nargis-ruba-jttrc.md) plays the part of the friendly tavern keeper perfectly. If the characters strike up a conversation without initially revealing that Samira sent them, Nargis is happy to gossip and to brag about the tavern, being one of the Kings of Coin, and that they've arranged a performance from the renowned [Diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md) Luma. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check intuits that something weighs heavily on Nargis's mind, though the tavern keeper won't say what (see "Nargis's Confession" below).

If asked about the attempt on Zenia's life, Nargis remains tight-lipped until the characters provide Samira's token and reveal their mission. In response, Nargis acknowledges the guards and says keeping Zenia in the tavern with a crowd of witnesses should make another attack less likely. Nargis then points out where Zenia sits at a corner table.

#### Meeting with Zenia

Two Silent Verse [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) sit at a table near the stage with Zenia, but they depart to allow the characters to sit if they see Samira's token. The tables near hers are packed with revelers, but the din of conversation makes it easy to talk without being heard.

Zenia greets the characters warmly. She is a gray-skinned orc [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) with her hair braided in elegant loops. She has an easygoing demeanor but is clearly nervous. Zenia is thrilled to meet adventurers and asks about the characters' work and travels. She admits to considering the adventuring life herself but knows that Nargis would never allow it.

If asked about the attack on her, Zenia shares what happened. Based on the characters' questions, use the following details to guide the conversation:

- Zenia was shopping along the River of Gold, escorted by several of her family's servants, when she suddenly felt ill.
- A cloud of pink ash appeared around her, and her servants began attacking her and each other.
- Zenia remembers a figure bumping into her before she felt ill.
- Zenia describes feeling sick during the attack, but says the sensation faded swiftly.

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check suspects Zenia might have been [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) but shook off the effects. Characters who specifically ask about a woman matching Kala's description and who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check cause Zenia to recall that the figure who bumped into her matches that description. Zenia doesn't know who the woman is, though, and can't name her.

#### Attack of the Divas

While the characters talk with Zenia, they hear raucous voices at the door.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Performers in bright feathers and shimmering silk flood into the tavern, laughing bombastically. The crowd, including Zenia, responds with great enthusiasm.
> 
> "That's [Diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md) Luma and the Elucidarium Divas!" Zenia says, nodding to the dark-skinned woman leading the group, whose outfit is all sequins and bright feathers.
> 
> The divas wave and proceed to the stage. There, [Diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md) Luma pulls a small silk bag from her belt and hurls its contents upward, standing amid a rain of colorful glitter as the performance begins.
> 
> A moment later, the [diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md)'s expression changes. [Diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md) Luma grins cruelly, slips off her heeled shoes, and leaps toward Zenia.
^189

Kala has been lurking near the Thornapple, looking for opportunities to strike at Zenia. She found her opportunity with [Diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md) Luma, tainting the [diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md)'s glitter—a feature of the [diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md)'s performances—with rage-inducing [biza's breath](/compendium/items/bizas-breath-jttrc.md).

[Diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md) Luma uses the [assassin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) stat block, but her only weapon is her wicked, high-heeled shoe, which functions as a Shortsword attack without poison. The other two divas use the [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) stat block and attack only with broken bottles that function the same as their Shortsword attack. As the divas are all under the effects of biza's breath, they each randomly make one melee attack against Zenia or a character on their turns. All three divas fail their saving throws to resist the poison affecting them for three rounds. On the fourth round, they overcome the effects of biza's breath and groggily stop attacking.

In the aftermath of the battle, characters who inspect the stage, the divas, or their glitter and succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check see the glitter left a film of pink ash on the divas and the floor around them. A character who examines the pink ash and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Medicine](/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check suspects this is some manner of poison.

#### Nargis's Confession

In the aftermath of the fight, terrified patrons clear the tavern. A distraught Nargis embraces Zenia and takes the blame for the attack. Characters can convince Nargis to reveal more through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Use the following points to guide Nargis's confession:

- Nargis confesses that their greed and arrogance doomed the firstborn children of the Kings of Coin.
- The jeli flower is the magical creation of a witch named Proud Edun. The Kings of Coin negotiated with the witch, promising their firstborn children would be her apprentices in exchange for the jeli flower and the wealth it would bring.
- Nargis talked the other Kings of Coin into murdering Proud Edun to break the bargain. After calling the witch to a secret meeting, they murdered her.

#### Learning about Kala Mabarin

When the effects of the poison end, [Diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md) Luma and her fellow entertainers apologize profusely, explaining they weren't in control of their bodies. If asked about what happened to them prior to going on stage, the performers recall that just before they entered the tavern, a datura introduced herself and offered [Diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md) Luma a fine sachet of glitter as thanks for many inspiring performances. The entertainers confirm that the woman was wearing green pantaloons and a yellow tunic if asked. If a character succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, they get Luma or one of the other performers to recall that the datura boldly and purposefully introduced herself as [Kala Mabarin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kala-mabarin-jttrc.md).

##### Nargis Knows

If Nargis hears the name [Kala Mabarin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kala-mabarin-jttrc.md), the tavern keeper begins to weep. Nargis tells the characters that Proud Edun had a daughter by that name, but she was lost in the jungle years before the Kings of Coin bargained with Proud Edun. Nargis begs the characters to find Kala and put an end to whatever she's scheming.

##### Following Up

Several folks outside the Thornapple recall seeing a figure matching Kala's description heading toward the pier.

## Peril at the Parade

The March of Vice parade begins as the characters make their way to the pier. The parade runs down the River of Gold and ends at the jetty. As the characters come to the city's central thoroughfare, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The streets are alive with joyful music and exuberant festival-goers watching an oncoming parade.
> 
> An open carriage drawn by an ox leads the procession. The carriage bears a large man wearing a white mask and vines of jeli flowers. He waves to the adoring public as figures in gowns and head scarves the color of jeli flowers march after him, sweeping the ground in wide strokes with handmade brooms.
^18f

The parade is a splendid affair, and the streets are flooded with revelers. Nearby, locals call out to the man in the carriage—calling him the "Prince of Vice"—to attract his attention. A character who asks a bystander about the significance of the Prince of Vice, or who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check, learns the details from the "March of Vice" section at the end of this adventure. Revelers can also point out that the Prince of Vice is [Azra Nir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/azra-nir-jttrc.md), the son of Grand Messer Amos Nir, the eldest member of the Kings of Coin.

Characters who follow the parade or search the pier for Kala wind up near the jetty as the parade reaches the end of the thoroughfare.

### Parade Ambush

As the parade nears the jetty, read the following description:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Grasping weeds and vines erupt from the cobblestone street beneath the carriage at the head of the parade. The ox pulling the cart panics, causing the vehicle to careen into a post covered in decorations. The vegetation then wraps around the cart's wheels and the closest bystanders. A pair of revelers produce weapons, revealing themselves to be guards protecting the Prince of Vice.
^191

As bystanders flee the area, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score spots a figure in green and yellow throwing something toward the cart. An instant later, a cloud of pink ashes bursts from a sachet, striking the two guards.

#### Kala's Attack

The parade route appears on map 5.1. The characters are either at the northwest or south side of the map, depending on their path from the Thornapple to the pier. The guards and [Azra Nir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/azra-nir-jttrc.md) cluster around the crashed carriage, while Kala starts on the side of the map farthest from the characters.

##### Azra Nir

Azra uses the [acolyte](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md) stat block and is surprised during the first round of combat. He seeks only to escape the chaos.

##### Guards

The two [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) are affected by the poison [biza's breath](/compendium/items/bizas-breath-jttrc.md) (detailed in a sidebar earlier in this adventure). They automatically fail their saving throws to end the poison's effect. The guards make one melee attack against a randomly determined creature within reach each round for 1 minute before the poison's effect ends.

##### Kala

Kala uses the [druid](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) stat block and has already cast [barkskin](/compendium/spells/barkskin.md), giving her AC 16. She keeps her distance from the poisoned guards as she tries to kill [Azra Nir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/azra-nir-jttrc.md) using [produce flame](/compendium/spells/produce-flame.md) and [thunderwave](/compendium/spells/thunderwave.md). She has three more doses of [biza's breath](/compendium/items/bizas-breath-jttrc.md), but they are prepared for use in combat.

##### Negotiating with Kala

A character can use an action to explain what they learned from Nargis about how Kala's mother was wronged and attempt a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a success, Kala stops attacking for 1 round. If a character succeeds on this check a second time, Kala stops attacking and agrees to discuss bringing her mother's murderers to justice without further bloodshed.

#### Spirit of Vengeance

If Kala is reduced to 0 hit points or apprehended, she calls out to the biza she made a pact with. If the characters convince Kala to call off her attack, this breaks her pact with the spirit, which has the same effect as her calling it. In either case, the biza appears above Kala at the start of the following round and attacks the characters.

The biza uses the [wraith](/compendium/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) stat block but does not have Sunlight Sensitivity.

As the biza attacks, it calls out and curses the names Amos Nir, Nargis Ruba, and the others listed in the "Kings of Coin" section later in this adventure. [Samira Arah](/compendium/bestiary/npc/samira-arah-jttrc.md) is omitted and spared the biza's ire, as she's only recently joined the council. Characters who've heard these names or who succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check recognize them. The biza goes on to accuse the Kings of Coin of killing it, revealing that it is the spirit of Proud Edun—a fact Kala never learned.

## Conclusion

Samira appears on the scene soon after Kala and the biza are defeated. Along with several Silent Verse guards, Samira quickly restores order. [Azra Nir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/azra-nir-jttrc.md) thanks the characters just before Samira has her guards move him somewhere safer.

If the characters defeat Kala and the biza, they can reveal what they've learned to Samira. Exposing the bargain the Kings of Coins made and Proud Edun's murder will bring turmoil to Zinda. Samira asks the characters not to share what they've learned until she determines how to respond.

If Kala survived, Samira is determined to bring her to justice but fears that the other Kings of Coin might seek revenge. At your discretion, Samira might have her guards spirit Kala away to a secret location, or she might ask the characters to take her to a safe place outside Zinda, like the Radiant Citadel. Either way, Samira will decide how to punish Kala and the Kings of Coin for their crimes.

Whatever the outcome, Samira pays the characters the amount agreed upon at the start of the adventure, and she throws in a [bag of holding](/compendium/items/bag-of-holding.md) filled with six flasks of jeli wine worth 25 gp each.

## Zinda Gazetteer

Zinda is a city of spiraling marble towers and turrets, of universities and guildhalls, and of specialty shops lining paved streets. Far below the balconies, the Court of Flowers and the pier ring with the merry laughter and the songs of laborers. Year round, Zinda's plazas and parlors are full of academics, merchants, and pilgrims. But for ten days in the summer, the March of Vice draws even larger crowds as the city celebrates the local wine trade—specifically, the jeli wine that has made Zinda the wealthiest city in the land. Zindanese citizens garb themselves in brightly colored costumes and feathered headdresses and indulge in feasting, song, and dance.

After its recent years of prosperity, a cloud has settled over the city. Political dissidents are rumored to disappear from their beds as the Silent Verse, the enforcers of the ruling Kings of Coin, stalk the streets. The newest member of the Kings of Coin, Madame [Samira Arah](/compendium/bestiary/npc/samira-arah-jttrc.md), grows restless with ambition and regularly hires mercenaries and spies to investigate her rivals' secrets. The Bloodletters laborers' union opposes the leadership of the aristocracy at every turn. And beneath it all, the dire secret on which Zinda's prosperity was built waits to be exposed.

### Features

Those familiar with Zinda know the following facts:

- **Hallmarks.** Zinda's people are known for cultivating the jeli flower, which features prominently in the annual March of Vice celebration.
- **People of Zinda.** Humans make up the majority of Zinda's population and have skin tones ranging from light brown to black. Their hair grows in spiral curls; most grow it long and wear it tucked beneath a headscarf topped by a wide-brimmed hat (if married) or set in scalp-hugging braids (if unmarried). Elves and halflings are also frequently seen in Zinda, along with other nonhumans.
- **Languages.** All Zindanese citizens speak Common and N'warian. Many Zindanese also speak Draconic, since the power and wealth typically attributed to dragons are considered virtuous to the Kings of Coin.

### Noteworthy Sites

In addition to its robust agricultural holdings, Zinda is home to magical universities, conservatories, museums, and other centers of the arts.

#### Court of Flowers

The Court of Flowers is the vibrant heart of commerce and art in Zinda. The district hosts streets lined with multiple palatial homes, towers with overflowing gardens, and museums. Performers gather here throughout the day, and merchants keep their shops open day and night. Most of the city's guilds—known in the city as trades—keep their headquarters among the district's towers. Artisans are expected to register with the headquarters of the appropriate trade and support the furthering of their craft.

#### Covenant

Hunched over brass cauldrons in their manor-like headquarters, members of the Covenant of Magic—an exclusive circle of traditionalist mages—preside over festivals, weddings, funerals, and similar events. Most covenant members are elderly; several have great-great-grandchildren who lead their own trades or are Kings of Coin. Their power stems less from magic and more from their far-reaching connections.

#### Elucidarium

The bardic college of Zinda, the Elucidarium, is the extravagant home of the famous divas of Zinda. Draped in bright silk and exuberant florals, the building is made of sculpted glass set with sparkling gemstones. Inside, musicians, dancers, orators, and thespians hone their talents. In addition to these public skills, students can also study spy-craft and information brokering. Those who visit looking for training in the arts might find themselves embroiled in the machinations of ruthless social climbers.

#### Jeli Gardens

The great gardens that spread to the west of the city are the source of Zinda's wealth. Many Zindanese laborers tend the jeli flowers that grow there, living in wood-and-stone huts in the heart of the gardens. These velvety flowers were discovered several years ago and can't be successfully cultivated elsewhere. Why Zinda is the only place where jeli flowers can grow is a mystery, but this single crop now supplies the city with raw materials for wine, dye, fabric, and paper. Gardeners occasionally fall prey to wicked spirits, zombies, and green hags that lurk in the jungle beyond the city, as Zinda has no standing army to protect these outlying regions.

### Life in Zinda

Art, commerce, and magic fill the lives of Zinda's people and touch on every aspect of society.

#### The Bloodletters

Clad in aprons stained with jeli dye, Bloodletters proselytize a life free from oppression by the elite. The group's name originates from its members' desire to drain the greed from Zinda like blood from a wound. Under the leadership of Captain Adann, the group works in open defiance of the Kings of Coin. The Bloodletters' attacks upon the Court of Flowers and sabotage of the jeli gardens make the group a frequent target of the Silent Verse.

#### Class Divide

Zinda has a stark class divide. The city's wealthy citizens live in large homes and revere academia, a strong work ethic, and wealth. Members of less affluent families sleep together in cramped quarters and often hold multiple jobs to survive. The rich feast on goat, fish, and mutton; wear gold and silk; and drink from spotless glass flutes while boasting of their academic achievements and frivolously displaying magic. The poor eat grains and roots served on palm leaves spread upon straw floors.

#### Faith and Ancestors

Though Zinda welcomes the practices of all citizens, the city's one common faith involves the daturas, also known as spirit shepherds. Daturas speak for and protect the spirits of the jungle. A datura might go years without meeting another member of the order, spending their life escorting caravans, performing exorcisms, and guarding sacred reaches of the forest. Others are hired to escort mourners to the sites of rare silk cotton trees, where the bereaved hang tokens for their recently departed ancestors. In some homes, particularly among the wealthy, whole rooms might be given over to altars intricately decorated to honor a family's ancestors.

#### March of Vice

During the height of summer, the people of Zinda celebrate the cultivation of the jeli flower with a multiday carnival. Built on traditions celebrating the city's wine trade, the March of Vice is overseen by the Prince of Vice—an organizer and theatrical figure. Chosen by the Kings of Coin, the masked Prince of Vice marches in the parade every evening. The parade is followed by the Covenant of Magic, magic-using elders who wave fans and brooms, symbolically sweeping Zinda's sin into the sea. On the tenth night, the Prince of Vice steps into the sea and sheds their mask, bringing the festivities to a close.

#### Kings of Coin

The Kings of Coin are the ruling council of Zinda, a collection of six elders from affluent families that represent specific trades. Their meetings occur weekly at the gilded collection of offices and towers known as the Vault of Justice. The following individuals currently hold positions on the council:

**Grand Messer Amos Nir** is head of the Kings of Coin and represents the Jeli Trade. He is the wealthiest, most influential leader in Zinda.

**Madame Kit Mata** represents the Grocers' Trade.

**Madame Samira Arah** is the newest member of the Kings of Coin. She represents the Jewelers' Trade and oversees the Silent Verse as head of security for the Kings of Coin.

**Messer Solenn Avim** represents the Weavers' Trade.

**Myx Nargis Ruba** represents the Tavern Keepers' Trade.

**Myx Massimo Ain** represents the Smiths' Trade.

The Kings of Coin keep order using their vast wealth, their societal influence, and the Silent Verse—the rulers' police force. The Silent Verse protects the Kings of Coin, collects information, and issues shadowy threats to keep political rivals in line.

#### Names

Zindanese of all origins receive their given name on the tenth day after their birth. The family gathers at this time, and the elders choose an appropriate ancestor's name to bestow upon the child. The following are examples of common names:

- **Feminine.** Inyz, Larisa, Onika, Tanea
- **Masculine.** Emran, Jacapo, Melo, Solenn
- **Gender-Neutral.** Amal, Elar, Jari, Pirro
- **Surnames.** Ain, Aran, Haro, Nir, Sur
- **Titles.** Madame, Messer, Myx

### Legends of Zinda

In the oldest legends, spirits of the jungle and ocean worked together to create Zinda where fire once met the sea, creating the black volcanic sand above which the city stands. These beings raised stone buildings from the earth, shifting rivers and trees to accommodate them. Satisfied with their creations, the ancestral apparitions welcomed the first Zindanese. Lately, the datura who walk the jungles warn that these spirits are agitated and seek appeasement from Zinda for its avarice.

The festival called the March of Vice shares similar supernatural origins. Tales tell of wicked spirits corrupting the people before being cast into the sea by a parade of elders. This legend is commemorated every summer through the March of Vice, with the members of the Covenant of Magic assuming the mantle of the elders.

### Characters from Zinda

If players want to create characters native to Zinda, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**Are you affiliated with any of the organizations in Zinda?** Do you belong to the Bloodletters or the Silent Verse? Should laborers be permitted the same rights as plutocratic rulers?

**How do you celebrate the March of Vice**? Do you revel with friends and local laborers? Do you attend galas among the wealthy? Do you perform in sequins and feathers as a Elucidarium [diva](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/diva-jttrc.md)?

**What do you know of the forest's spirits?** Have you trained as a mystical datura to hear spirits' voices and learn their ways?
