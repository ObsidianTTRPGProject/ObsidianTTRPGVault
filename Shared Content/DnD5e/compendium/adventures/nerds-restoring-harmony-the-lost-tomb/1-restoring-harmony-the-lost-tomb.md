# Restoring Harmony: The Lost Tomb
*Source: NERDS Restoring Harmony: The Lost Tomb, p. 2* 

Welcome to Restoring Harmony, a Dungeons & Dragons adventure series in collaboration with the tasty and colorful world of NERDS.

To run this adventure, you need the fifth edition Basic Rules for D&D, which is available as a free download here. All the magic items and monster stat blocks you need are included at the end of this adventure.

Adventure Together is a campaign that's divided into six 1st-level mini adventures for a solo player and one longer adventure for multiple players. Each mini adventure takes approximately 45 minutes to play and the final adventure takes approximately 60–90 minutes to play.

The mini adventures can be played in any order, but the final adventure should be played last. Here is a list of all the adventures:

- Adventure 1 The Candy Mountain Caper
- Adventure 2 A Voice in the Wilderness
- Adventure 3 A Sticky Situation
- Adventure 4 Circus of Illusions
- Adventure 5 The Lost Tomb
- Adventure 6 A Web of Lies
- Adventure 7 Adventure Together

## Story Summary

Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.

To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more. But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.

The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!

## Solo Play

Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.

You can also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes on rolls, having monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.

### TPK: Total Party Kill

In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd [potion of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md) lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.

In the case of an untimely death, you can have a helpful NPC (like Mr. Honeycutt) save the day and revive them, or you can have them forego death saving throws and wake up as they're being dragged someplace unpleasant.

## Adventure Outline

This is a quick overview of Adventure 5:

- Purple the Wizard gets a mysterious message to meet a "Mr. Honeycutt" at the statue of Filomena within Prism Academy campus.
- Mr. Honeycutt informs Purple that he is looking for the Violet Gem. He believes that the answer is inscribed on an amber stone that he gives to Purple to decipher.
- Purple deciphers the runes. The clues lead to a well-known but off-limits location within Prism Academy called Herald's Crypt.
- Purple finds a way into the crypt and discovers a secret door that leads to a secret tomb where the Violet Gem is hidden.

## Beginning Play

Give the character sheet (see "Purple the Wizard," below) to your player and let them familiarize themselves with Purple.

All creatures or NPCs that are bolded have stat blocks, which are included at the end of the adventure along with any magic items the characters can earn.

Whenever you're both ready, you can start the session.

## Adventure 5: The Lost Tomb

The adventure begins with Purple deep in thought at the School of Evocation in Prism Academy. Lately, researchers at the academy have been hard at work attempting to discover what could be behind the color outages plaguing Harmony, and Purple's mentor has them working overtime to find any clue as to the cause of this mysterious dulling of Harmony. Many theories abound, and each school of magic claims they have working hypotheses, but no one has anything concrete.

When you're ready to start play, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You are in your study, poring over old books about the magical history of Harmony's vibrant color, trying to find an explanation for it fading away, when a beautiful butterfly alights on your windowsill. It looks at you with sparkling eyes and says, "Go to the statue of Filomena the Wise." Then it disappears into twinkling motes of light.
^007

Purple knows this statue. Filomena the Wise was one of the founding wizards of the Prism Academy. The 8-foot-tall statue of Filomena is in a quiet, wooded glade within the campus, about a five-minute walk away from Purple's study.

### Meeting Mr. Honeycutt

A dapper gentleman in a suit with horn-rimmed glasses is waiting for Purple at the statue. The man motions for Purple to come and sit on a bench. The man is [Mr. Honeycutt](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mr-honeycutt-nrh-tcmc.md), the Magister of the Lorekeeper Society. He begs for Purple's understanding for complete secrecy as he unrolls a spell scroll of [silence](/compendium/spells/silence.md) and casts the spell. Mr. Honeycutt previously imbibed a potion of [telepathy](/compendium/spells/telepathy.md), and he then speaks the following in Purple's head:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Forgive the precautions, but there are always ears about. My name is Mr. Honeycutt, and I belong to the Lorekeeper Society. You may not have heard of us, but we have been watching you—and right now, we desperately need your help.
^009

With a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check, Purple has heard a legend about a secret society of wizards and lycanthropes who pledged to defend the magic of Harmony against all manner of enemies. On a failed check, Purple knows only that the society is a secret one that is dedicated to the good of Harmony.

Mr. Honeycutt explains that he needs to find the Violet Gem, a magic stone that he says can help the Lorekeeper Society find the cause of these color outages. He has come to Purple to ask for their help in unlocking the mystery. Honeycutt reaches into his leather satchel and pulls out a piece of polished amber inscribed with runes. Mr. Honeycutt says that this piece of amber is the key to finding the Violet Gem, but no one in the Lorekeeper Society knows how to decipher it. If Purple helps decipher the amber stone and recover the Violet Gem, the Lorekeepers and all Harmony would be forever in Purple's debt. Mr. Honeycutt is also willing to throw in a pouch of 25 gold pieces for the trouble.

Mr. Honeycutt asks Purple to leave a note for him at the tavern when they find the Gem, and he'll meet them back at the statue of Filomena the Wise within the hour.

#### Amber Runestone

The piece of amber is an ancient key that unlocks a secret door in Herald's Crypt—a famous tomb underneath the academy. This [amber runestone](/compendium/items/amber-runestone-nrh-tlt.md) is also a magic item that Purple can attune to by spending a short rest focused on only on the item while in physical contact with it. See the end of the adventure for its game statistics.

### Deciphering the Runes

During their studies, Purple has come across several tomes that had such runes. With two successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) checks, Purple can find the books within Prism Academy's library. If Purple asks for help from the librarian, they make the checks with advantage. With two failures, Purple still finds the books but manages to make noise or otherwise incur the librarian's disapproving look.

Once translated, the runes on the amber say two things. One is a series of numbers: 12, 2, 6, 9, 24, and 36. The other runes are a poem:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Attune the stone to light the way. At Herald's Crypt one kneels to pray, Turn my skull then bow your head, Lest you who seek now join the dead. Once in my tomb, my name speak thrice, A gift of sunlight is the price.
^00c

Purple has heard of Herald's Crypt—a special place, strictly off-limits to students, where the headmasters of Prism Academy are buried. Students have seen the iron door (known as the Flower Door for all the intricately carved flowers in it) that leads to the crypt during school meetings in the Great Hall.

### Getting into Herald's Crypt

The entrance to Herald's Crypt is the massive Flower Door that is off to the side of the Great Hall within Prism Academy. There are two main ways to open the door:

- Convince Headmaster Gustava (Lawful good, human, [archmage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) to allow Purple to open the Flower Door and enter the crypt. Purple must make a successful DC 17 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) or—with a more wizardly argument—a successful DC 17 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to convince the headmaster.
- Sneak in using the [amber runestone](/compendium/items/amber-runestone-nrh-tlt.md). If Purple attunes to the stone, they can shine sunlight on the Flower Door. Doing this reveals a series of glowing numerals, 1–50, that are in the center of each of the flowers on the door. Pressing the numerals in the sequence written on the stone (12, 2, 6, 9, 24, and 36) opens the magic lock. An incorrect sequence sets off an alarm that summons Headmaster Gustava, who appears instantly.

If your player comes up with another clever way to get into the crypt, run with it!

Once the door is opened, Purple sees a set of stone stairs that descend 30 feet into darkness.

## Herald's Crypt Locations

The following locations are keyed to the map included with this adventure.

### H1. Crypt Door

The stone stairs lead to a corridor that ends at a locked iron door. The door has AC 15, 100 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

On the door is inscribed a riddle:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Dust a hand cannot clean, A button a hand cannot push, A cog a hand cannot freeze.
^010

Purple notices a perfect square of what looks like dirt on the door. It can't be cleaned by hand, only with a [prestidigitation](/compendium/spells/prestidigitation.md) spell.

When the dirt is cleaned off, it reveals a small button. Again, the button can't be pushed except by a [mage hand](/compendium/spells/mage-hand.md) spell.

When the button is pushed, it turns into a cog that begins turning. It can only be stopped by targeting it with the [ray of frost](/compendium/spells/ray-of-frost.md) spell.

When the cog is frozen, the door unlocks with an audible click. A carved mouth appears on the door and says, "Enter."

If your player gets too frustrated with the riddle, the mouth can appear early and give Purple some hints.

### H2. Herald's Crypt

This stone room is a sacred place that honors the headmasters of Prism Academy. The walls of this 50-foot-long hall are lined with alcoves, each one holding the tomb of a former headmaster. The crypt is well maintained; the brass fittings are polished and the floors are freshly mopped.

When Purple enters, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You've heard a lot about this place in your time at Prism Academy. Herald's Crypt is a sacred place that is venerated by all the faculty. You see the tombs of the former headmasters in alcoves along the walls, and flowers and notes of appreciation are laid before the tombs in silent reverence. You've also heard that the tombs are warded with powerful magic—anyone attempting to defile them would face certain death.
^012

> [!quote] Looting the Crypt
> 
> Even though the tombs are tempting, they are not meant for Purple to loot. Purple has heard stories told around Prism Academy that the tombs are protected by deadly spells cast by high-level archmages. Some faculty members say that the whole crypt is a dangerous booby trap and that's why it is strictly off-limits.
> 
> Despite this warning, your player may want to forego social decency and try to plunder the tombs. If this happens, let the tomb defend itself—which will most likely result in Purple's spectacular death (see "TPK: Total Party Kill," above).
^looting-the-crypt

Each crypt is engraved with the name of the deceased, and ornately carved and decorated with coats of arms and other heraldry significant to that headmaster.

#### Glyphs of Warding

Each crypt is sealed with a glyph of warding, and only Headmaster Gustava knows the passwords that deactivate the glyphs. To detect the wards, Purple must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check or cast detect magic.

Trying to break into a tomb triggers the glyph. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 45 (10d8) thunder damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Triggering a glyph also alerts Headmaster Gustava, who appears one round later via the teleport spell.

#### A. Professor Magillicus

This tomb has the bas-relief of a wizard holding a wand aloft. The words "A founding member of Prism Academy" are inscribed on the tomb.

Inside the tomb is the corpse of Professor Magillicus in his Prism Academy robes.

#### B. Professor Filomena

This tomb has the bas-relief of a wizard who looks like the statue of Filomena in the wooded glade (see "Meeting Mr. Honeycutt" above), holding an opened book in one hand and a wizard's staff in the other. The words "A founding member of Prism Academy" are inscribed on the tomb.

Inside the tomb is the corpse of Professor Filomena in her Prism Academy robes.

#### C. Professor Orm

This tomb has the bas-relief of a wizard holding a human skull in his hand. The words, "He investigated far into the shadow realms." are inscribed on the tomb.

Inside the tomb are the Prism Academy robes of Professor Orm. His corpse is nowhere to be found.

##### Opening the Secret Door

If the amber runestone is used to shine sunlight on the skull carved on the tomb, the skull glows, becomes three-dimensional, and hovers before Purple.

The runes carved on the amber stone (see "Deciphering the Runes," above) instruct Purple to kneel and bow their head after turning the skull to one side. Doing so causes a bolt of lightning to shoot over the top of Purple's head, opening a secret door to area H3.

If Purple kneels and turns the skull but doesn't bow their head, a lightning bolt lashes out towards Purple in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Solving the Riddle

If the player is struggling with the riddle, have the amber runestone glow or have it telepathically remind them about the runes and the riddle. It can even show them a mental image of what to do with the skull.

If Purple is killed by the lightning bolt, have them wake up in the crypt or back outside the Flower Door and realize that the past several minutes were a vivid vision of what was to come.

#### D. Professor Waziti

This tomb has the bas-relief of a wizard with his hand on a globe. The words, "He opened the doors to the cosmos." are inscribed on the tomb.

Inside the tomb is the corpse of Professor Waziti in his Prism Academy robes.

#### E. Professor Alexandra

This tomb has the bas-relief of a plump wizard surrounded by farm animals and magical creatures. The words "She was [Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)'s mystery and magic made flesh" are inscribed on the tomb.

Inside the tomb is the corpse of Professor Alexandra in her Prism Academy robes.

#### F. Professor Althea

This tomb has the bas-relief of a wizard with an intense expression, encircled by a wreath of fire. The words "She who hurled the fire" are inscribed on the tomb.

Inside the tomb is the corpse of Professor Althea in her Prism Academy robes. Her skeleton wears a [necklace of fireballs](/compendium/items/necklace-of-fireballs.md).

#### G. Professor Wigglewumpus

This tomb has the bas-relief of a gnome wizard surrounded by all manner of mechanical trinkets and toys. The words "Voted the 'Most Fun Professor Ever' by the students of Prism Academy, 200 years in a row" are inscribed on the tomb.

Inside the tomb is the tiny corpse of Professor Wigglewumpus in his Prism Academy robes, as well as a small wind-up duck that quacks and tells the time when activated.

### H3. Secret Passage

If the secret door in Professor Orm's tomb is opened, a stone slab slides back to reveal a 5-foot-wide passage that leads to another stone door. The door is unlocked, and opens into area H4.

### H4. Tomb of Professor Prism

When Purple enters the room, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> In the middle of the room rests a stone sarcophagus atop a black marble bier. The sarcophagus is carved with arcane symbols and an inscription: "Zimandius Prism, founder of Prism Academy." On the lid is a carving of a sleeping wizard. Clasped in the wizard's stone hands is a brilliant violet gem, the same size as the amber stone you're holding.
^021

The gem is indeed the Violet Gem that Mr. Honeycutt wants. If Purple follows the riddle correctly (see "Deciphering the Runes," above), they need to speak the name "Zimandius" or "Zimandius Prism" three times and then swaps the Violet Gem with the [amber runestone](/compendium/items/amber-runestone-nrh-tlt.md).

Purple must make the swap quickly; one round after the Violet Gem is removed, the door to the room is sealed by a heavy block of stone, and the stone hands on top of the sarcophagus begin blindly searching for the amber runestone. As soon as either the Violet Gem or the amber stone is put into the wizard's hands, the block of stone disappears and the room opens.

Again, if the player struggles to solve the riddle and swap the Violet Gem for the amber stone, have the amber runestone guide them telepathically.

#### Inside the Coffin

As with the other tombs, Professor Prism's tomb is protected by a glyph of warding that triggers when the tomb is opened (see "Glyphs of Warding," above). The sarcophagus contains the body of Professor Zimandius Prism.

### Completing the Mission

If all goes well, Purple leaves a note at the tavern for Mr. Honeycutt, then returns to the statue of Filomena the Wise to meet with Mr. Honeycutt and give him the Violet Gem.

Mr. Honeycutt is grateful for the return of the Violet Gem. He wants to hear how Purple deciphered the runes and found the gem, all the while scribbling notes in his black notebook.

As a reward, he gives Purple a [rust bag of tricks](/compendium/items/bag-of-tricks-rust.md) and asks if Purple will join the Lorekeeper Society and help find out how to restore the color to Harmony.
