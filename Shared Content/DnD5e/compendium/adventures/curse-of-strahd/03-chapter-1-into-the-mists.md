# Chapter 1: Into the Mists
*Source: Curse of Strahd, p. 9* 

Eerie mists surround Barovia and bind its inhabitants there. This chapter gives you the information you need to prepare for the adventurers' journey into those mists. The chapter first outlines the history and goals of Count [Strahd von Zarovich](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strahd-von-zarovich-cos.md) so that you are prepared for what awaits the characters. In the "Fortunes of Ravenloft" section, the chapter walks you through the tarokka card reading that helps set the stage for the adventure's action, and the chapter closes with adventure hooks that you can use to draw the characters into the horror of Barovia.

## Strahd von Zarovich

[Strahd von Zarovich](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strahd-von-zarovich-cos.md), a vampire and wizard, has the statistics presented in appendix D. Although he can be encountered almost anywhere in his domain, the vampire is always encountered in the place indicated by the card reading later in this chapter, unless he has been forced into his tomb in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.

### The Vampire's History

In life, [Strahd von Zarovich](/compendium/bestiary/npc/strahd-von-zarovich-cos.md) was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family's enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Barovia, after his deceased father, and was so struck by its scenic beauty that he decided to settle there.

Queen Ravenovia lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he remained. Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him. Unwilling to go the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return for the promise of immortality.

Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of his ancestral homeland. Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his love for her. When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with him. Sergei eventually took up residence at Ravenloft, but Ravenovia passed away while traveling to her namesake. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed his mother's body in a crypt beneath the castle.

Strahd's attention soon turned to Tatyana, a young Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished Tatyana with gifts and attention. Despite Strahd's efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer Sergei. Strahd's pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple's love until the day of Sergei and Tatyana's wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. Strahd murdered Sergei and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. He then chased Sergei's bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. Tatyana hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd's pursuit, plunging to her death. Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows.

But Strahd did not die. The Dark Powers honored the pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a vampire.

After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed the family bloodline and doomed all of Barovia. The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.

Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts—none as beloved as Tatyana, but each a person of beauty. All of them he turned into vampire spawn. Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia, they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to his domain, to play the vampire's game of cat-and-mouse. Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers offer him no lands to conquer, they aren't so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion.

Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever good enough in his eyes. He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father could sway the Dark Powers to release him.

### Strahd's Goals

Strahd has the following goals in the adventure.

#### Turn Ireena Kolyana

Strahd's unrequited love for Tatyana drove him to slay his brother, Sergei. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman [Ireena Kolyana](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos.md) in the village of Barovia and felt extreme déjà vu. Ireena looked exactly like Tatyana! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the latest reincarnation of Tatyana, and thus he seeks to claim her.

Strahd's evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home—the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of Barovia—and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort.

Chapter 3 gives details about Ireena and where to find her in the village of Barovia.

#### Find Rudolph van Richten

Although he is usually focused on making [Ireena Kolyana](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos.md) his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named Rudolph van Richten has come to Barovia. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching Barovia for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and slowly break his spirit.

Chapter 5 describes the town of Vallaki, where van Richten currently resides incognito.

#### Search for a Successor or Consort

Strahd can sense the arrival of new blood in his domain. When newcomers enter Barovia, he shifts his attention from [Ireena Kolyana](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos.md) and van Richten to his new guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn't arrive at this conclusion immediately.)

Strahd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piqued—even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.

### Roleplaying Strahd

Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn't suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate.

When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of Tatyana, but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn't have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone.

In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers still—not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won't yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd's humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he's preying on [Ireena Kolyana](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos.md), he tells them that Ireena's body is the host for Tatyana's soul, and Tatyana's soul belongs to him.

Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a time—playthings to possess or discard as he desires.

If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, Strahd doesn't honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.

### When Strahd Attacks

Strahd isn't a villain who remains out of sight until the final scene. Far from it—he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The characters can and should meet him multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card reading. His combat details are available in appendix D.

When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he pays them a visit, either under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day. If they're indoors, he tries to charm or goad a character into inviting him inside (along with his vampire spawn, if they are present). Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena.

These encounters are meant to test the characters, not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.

## Fortunes of Ravenloft

The events of this adventure are part of dark twists of fate that a fortuneteller can discern with the cards of a tarokka deck. Before you run this adventure, you must draw cards from a deck to determine the following elements of the adventure:

- Strahd's location inside Castle Ravenloft
- The placement of three important treasures that can be used against Strahd—the [Tome of Strahd](/compendium/items/tome-of-strahd-cos.md), the [Holy Symbol of Ravenkind](/compendium/items/holy-symbol-of-ravenkind-cos.md), and the [Sunsword](/compendium/items/sunsword-cos.md)
- The identity of a powerful ally in the fight against Strahd

This card reading can make the adventure different each time you play it.

At some point during the adventure, the characters are likely to meet [Madam Eva](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-eva-cos.md), the old Vistani seer (see chapter 2, area G), who can perform the same card reading for them. Characters can also have [Ezmerelda d'Avenir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ezmerelda-davenir-cos.md) perform a card reading for them, provided she has her deck of tarokka cards. Ezmerelda's cards are hidden in her wagon (chapter 11, area V1).

Appendix E shows all the cards of the tarokka deck and summarizes their symbolic meanings.

> [!quote] Using Regular Playing Cards
> 
> If you like, you can use a regular deck of playing cards in place of the tarokka deck. To do so, separate the numbered cards from the face cards and jokers, and treat them as two separate decks: the common deck (the numbered cards) and the high deck (the face cards and jokers).
> 
> **Common Deck.** Each suit in a regular deck of playing cards corresponds to a suit in the tarokka deck. The ace cards represent the "1" cards in the tarokka deck, and the "10" cards represent the "master" cards in the tarokka deck.

### Card Reading

When you perform a card reading before running the adventure, write down the results for reference later. If the characters have their fortunes read in the adventures, do the card reading again, out loud for the players' benefit. Substitute the new results for the old ones.

When you're ready to begin the card reading, remove the fourteen cards with the crown icon (the high deck) and shuffle them. Then shuffle the remaining cards (the common deck), keeping the two decks separate. Draw the top three cards from the common deck and lay them face down in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Then draw the top two cards from the high deck and lay them face down in the 4 and 5 positions, as shown below:

Once all five cards are drawn and placed face down, follow the instructions below for each card in order.

### Strahd's Enemy

Drawn from the high deck, the fourth card in the card reading determines the location of an NPC who can improve the characters' chances of defeating Strahd. (Some cards offer two possible results, A and B; in such a case, you can pick the one you prefer or that better suits the circumstances of the adventure.)

Strahd senses that this NPC is a danger to him and tries to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible. This NPC, whoever it ends up being, gains the following additional action:

#### Inspire

While within sight of Strahd, this character grants inspiration to one player character he or she can see.

Each of the NPCs described in this section has a role to play in the adventure, even if that individual isn't indicated in the card reading. For the one so designated, however, the information in this section regarding the NPC's behavior takes precedence over whatever is said elsewhere in these pages; that NPC is extraordinary.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Artifact (Joker 1**)
> 
> Look for an entertaining man with a monkey. This man is more than he seems.
^05c

This card refers to [Rictavio](/compendium/bestiary/npc/rictavio-cos.md) (see appendix D), who can be found at the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki (chapter 5, area N2). Normally reluctant to accompany the characters, [Rictavio](/compendium/bestiary/npc/rictavio-cos.md) changes his tune if the characters tell him about the card reading. He sheds his disguise and introduces himself as Dr. Rudolph van Richten.

The characters might think that [Gadof Blinsky](/compendium/bestiary/npc/gadof-blinsky-cos.md), the toymaker of Vallaki (area N7), is the figure they seek, because he has a pet monkey. If they speak to him about this possibility, Blinsky jokes that he and the monkey are "old friends," but if the characters ask him to come with them to fight Strahd, he politely declines. If the characters tell him about the tarokka reading, Blinsky admits that he acquired the monkey from a half-elf carnival ringmaster named [Rictavio](/compendium/bestiary/npc/rictavio-cos.md).

This card refers to the werewolf [Zuleika Toranescu](/compendium/bestiary/npc/zuleika-toranescu-cos.md) (see chapter 15, area Z7). She will accompany the characters if they promise to avenge her mate, Emil, by killing the leader of her pack, [Kiril Stoyanovich](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kiril-stoyanovich-cos.md).

This card refers to [Donavich](/compendium/bestiary/npc/donavich-cos.md), the priest in the village of Barovia (see chapter 3, area E5). He will not accompany the characters until his son, [Doru](/compendium/bestiary/npc/doru-cos.md), is dead and buried.

^061

This card refers to [Victor Vallakovich](/compendium/bestiary/npc/victor-vallakovich-cos.md) (see chapter 5, area N3t). Realizing that the characters are the key to his salvation, he enthusiastically leaves home and accompanies them to Castle Ravenloft.

^062

This card refers to [Stella Wachter](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stella-wachter-cos.md) (see chapter 5, area N4n). She grants the party no benefit unless her madness is cured. With her wits restored, Stella is happy to join the party and leave her rotten family behind.

^063

This card refers to [Kasimir Velikov](/compendium/bestiary/npc/kasimir-velikov-cos.md) (see chapter 5, area N9a). The dusk elf accompanies the characters to Castle Ravenloft only after they lead him to the Amber Temple and help him find the means to resurrect his dead sister, [Patrina Velikovna](/compendium/bestiary/npc/patrina-velikovna-cos.md).

^064

This card refers to the revenant [Sir Godfrey Gwilym](/compendium/bestiary/npc/sir-godfrey-gwilym-cos.md) (see chapter 7, area Q37). Although initially unwilling to accompany the characters, he will do so if the characters convince him that the honor of the Order of the Silver Dragon can be restored with his help. Doing this requires a successful DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

This card refers to Sir Klutz the [phantom warrior](/compendium/bestiary/undead/phantom-warrior-cos.md) (see chapter 4, area K84, crypt 33). If Sir Klutz is Strahd's enemy, then the phantom warrior disappears not after seven days, but only after he or Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points.

This card refers to [Ismark Kolyanovich](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ismark-kolyanovich-cos.md) (see chapter 3, area E2). Ismark won't accompany the characters to Castle Ravenloft until he knows that his sister, [Ireena Kolyana](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos.md), is safe.

> 
> **A. Horseman (Joker 2)**

^067

This card refers to [Nikolai Wachter](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nikolai-wachter-cos.md) the elder, who is dead (see chapter 5, area N4o). If the characters cast a [raise dead](/compendium/spells/raise-dead.md) spell or a [resurrection](/compendium/spells/resurrection.md) spell on his preserved corpse, Nikolai (LN male human [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) agrees to help the characters once he feels well enough, despite his wife's protests. Although his family has long supported Strahd, Nikolai came to realize toward the end of his life that Strahd must be destroyed to save Barovia.

If the characters don't have the means to raise Nikolai from the dead, [Rictavio](/compendium/bestiary/npc/rictavio-cos.md) (see appendix D) gives them a spell scroll of [raise dead](/compendium/spells/raise-dead.md) if he learns of their need. If they're staying at the Blue Water Inn, he leaves the scroll in one of their rooms.

^068

This card refers to the Vistani assassin [Arrigal](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arrigal-cos.md) (see chapter 5, area N9c). If the characters mention this card reading to him, he accepts his fate and accompanies them. If the characters succeed in defeating Strahd, [Arrigal](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arrigal-cos.md) betrays and attacks them, believing that he is destined to become Barovia's new lord.

This card refers to [Parriwimple](/compendium/bestiary/npc/parriwimple-cos.md) (see chapter 3, area E1). Although he's a simpleton, he won't travel to Castle Ravenloft without good cause. Characters can manipulate him into going by preying on his good heart. For instance, he might go there to help rescue missing Barovians, or to save the life of [Ireena Kolyana](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos.md), who is very beautiful. The characters must somehow deal with Bildrath, [Parriwimple](/compendium/bestiary/npc/parriwimple-cos.md)'s employer, who won't let the foolish boy go to the castle for any reason.

This card refers to [Ireena Kolyana](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos.md) (see chapter 3, area E4). Her brother, Ismark, opposes the idea of Ireena's being taken to Castle Ravenloft, but she insists on going there once the characters tell her about the card reading. Ireena won't accompany the characters, however, until Kolyan Indirovich's body is laid to rest in the cemetery.

This card refers to [Clovin Belview](/compendium/bestiary/npc/clovin-belview-cos.md) (see chapter 8, area S17), the two-headed [mongrelfolk](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mongrelfolk-cos.md). Clovin serves [the Abbot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/the-abbot-cos.md) out of fear and a perverse sense of loyalty. His job is to deliver food to the other mongrelfolk, whom he abhors. If [the Abbot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/the-abbot-cos.md) still lives, Clovin doesn't want to earn his Master's ire by attempting to leave, and he refuses to accompany the characters. But if [the Abbot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/the-abbot-cos.md) dies, Clovin doesn't have any reason to remain in the abbey, so he's willing to come along if he is bribed with wine. Clovin provides no benefit to the party without his viol.

The old wereraven, realizing that he has a chance to end Strahd's tyranny, leaves his vineyard and winery in the capable hands of his sons, Adrian and Elvir. But before he travels to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd, Davian insists on reconciling with his third son, Urwin Martikov (see chapter 5, area N2).

### Strahd's Location in the Castle

Drawn from the high deck, the fifth card in the card reading determines the location of the final showdown with Strahd—the place in Castle Ravenloft where the characters are sure to find him. The first time the characters arrive at the foretold location, Strahd is there, provided he hasn't been forced back into his coffin.

> [!quote] ...

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Mists (Queen of Spades)**
> 
> The cards can't see where the evil lurks. The mists obscure all!
^07d

The card offers no clue about where the final showdown with Strahd will occur. It can happen anywhere you like in Castle Ravenloft. Alternatively, [Madam Eva](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-eva-cos.md) tells the characters to return to her after at least three days, and she will consult the cards again for them, but only to discern the location of their enemy.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Raven (Queen of Clubs)**
> 
> Look to the mother's tomb.
^07e

Strahd faces the characters in the tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (area K88).

> [!quote] ...
> 
> **Tempter (Queen of Diamonds)**
> 
> I see a secret place—a vault of temptation hidden behind a woman of great beauty. The evil waits atop his tower of treasure.
^07f

Strahd confronts the characters in the treasury (area K41). "A woman of great beauty" refers to the portrait of Tatyana hanging in the castle's study (area K37), which contains a secret door that leads to the treasury.

## Adventure Hooks

In the event that begins the adventure, the fates of Strahd and the adventurers are entwined as the characters are invited or forced into his domain. Different ways to get the adventurers to Barovia are described in the sections that follow. Use whichever one you favor.

In "Plea for Help," a colorfully dressed stranger approaches the characters while they are staying at a tavern. The stranger delivers a letter from his master, inviting them to the village of Barovia with an urgent request for their assistance. If the characters take the bait, the fog engulfs them as they cross into Strahd's domain.

In "Mysterious Visitors," the characters are asked to scare off a band of rowdy travelers who are camped outside the town of Daggerford, on the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. The travelers welcome the characters to their camp and invite them to sit by their fire while their elder recounts a tragic tale of a cursed yet noble prince. The characters, lulled into a trance by the fire, awaken to find themselves on a foggy road, delivered to Barovia by their Vistani hosts.

In "Werewolves in the Mist," the characters are drawn together by a series of werewolf attacks. The hunt for this pack of lycanthropes leads the characters into a forest, where they are swept into the land of Barovia. This hook assumes the use of the five factions featured in the Adventurers League.

In "Creeping Fog," the characters are traveling a lonely road through the woods when the fog engulfs them, spiriting them away to the land of Barovia.

### Plea for Help

The characters start their adventure in an old tavern, the details of which are for you to decide.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> To a party of seasoned adventurers such as yourselves, what you see is but another dull tavern in another dull town in some nameless province. It is but another span of time between the challenges of true adventuring.
> 
> Outside the tavern, a fog lies over the town this evening. The damp, cobbled pavement glistens as the lights of street lanterns dance across the slick stones. The fog chills the bones and shivers the soul of anyone outside.
> 
> Yet inside these tavern walls the food is hearty, and the ale is warm and frothy. A fire blazes in the hearth, and the tavern is alive with the tumbling voices of country folk.
> 
> Suddenly, the tavern door swings open, and a hush falls over the room. Framed by the lamp-lit fog, a form strides through the doorway. His heavy, booted footfalls and the jingle of his coins shatter the silence. His brightly colored clothes are draped in loose folds about him, and his hat hangs askew, hiding his eyes in shadows. Without hesitation, he walks up to your table and stands proudly in a wide stance with folded arms.
> 
> In an accented voice he says, "I have been sent to you to deliver this message. If you be creatures of honor, you will come to my Master's aid at first light. It is not advisable to travel the Svalich Woods at night!" He pulls from his tunic a sealed letter, addressed to all of you in beautiful flowing script. He drops the letter on the table. "Take the west road from here some five hours march down through the Svalich Woods. There you will find my master in Barovia."
> 
> Amid the silent stares of the patronage, the man strides to the bar and says to the wary barkeep, "Fill the glasses, one and all. Their throats are obviously parched." He drops a purse heavy with gold on the bar. With that, he leaves.
> 
> The babble of tavern voices resumes, although somewhat subdued. The letter is lying before you. The seal is in the shape of a crest you don't recognize.
^082

The characters can interrupt the messenger at any time. His name is [Arrigal](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arrigal-cos.md) (NE male human [assassin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)), and he is a Vistani. The other tavern patrons regard his people as friendly folk who travel about in covered wagons and usually keep to themselves.

[Arrigal](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arrigal-cos.md) describes Barovia as a valley of great beauty and his master as a remarkable man. If the characters question [Arrigal](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arrigal-cos.md) about the identity of his master, he claims to serve Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, but in truth he serves Strahd. After delivering the letter, [Arrigal](/compendium/bestiary/npc/arrigal-cos.md) mounts his horse and rides off. He doesn't wait for the characters to follow him.

The crest depicted on the letter's seal belongs to Strahd, though the characters have never seen it before. Show the players Strahd's crest.

The letter, which seems to have been written by the burgomaster, was actually penned by Strahd. If the characters read the letter, show the players "Kolyan Indirovich's Letter (Version 1)" in appendix F. The letter is bait to lure the adventurers to Barovia. If the characters take the bait, they arrive at area A (see chapter 2, "The Lands of Barovia").

### Mysterious Visitors

The details of this adventure hook assume that your D&D campaign is based in or near Daggerford, a town on the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms, but you can change the location to suit your campaign.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Duchess Morwen of Daggerford is having guests for dinner—and you are invited. No strangers to Daggerford, you have come to the town's defense on more than one occasion, and you count Lady Morwen as a friend and a benefactor.
> 
> A cool autumn breeze blows through the streets as you make your way to the keep. As you dine on hot, spicy soup and tenderly cooked pheasant, you can tell that the duchess seems more out of sorts than usual. Then a pall comes over the occasion as she voices her concern about a band of wayward travelers camped outside the town's walls. They seemed harmless at first, but Morwen has received reports that they have begun harassing townsfolk and other visitors as they come and go, demanding money and wine, and threatening to put hexes on anyone who doesn't pay up.
> 
> Yesterday, the duchess ordered several guards to scare away the mysterious visitors, but they couldn't get the job done. When the guards returned, they spoke sympathetically about the visitors. It seemed as if the guards had been magically charmed.
> 
> Morwen doesn't want an armed conflict, but she aims to send a stern message to the visitors and asks you to deliver it on her behalf. "If they don't leave before dawn," she says, "I'll burn their wagons to the ground."
^084

The characters are asked to deliver Duchess Morwen's message immediately after dinner.

The travelers are camped on the hill outside the gates of Daggerford, near the road. Guards atop the walls watch the camp closely at all hours.

When the characters approach the camp, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> As the evening grows dark, you see a dozen men and women gathered around a crackling bonfire. The folk are in good spirits. A few of them sing and dance around the fire while others find happiness in their flasks and wineskins. Three barrel-topped wagons are parked at odd angles. Tied to a nearby tree, grazing, are half a dozen draft horses wearing bright coats with bangles and tassels.
^085

The men and women are Vistani. They have no interest in Daggerford. Their orders are to deliver the characters safely to Barovia.

The leader of this group is [Stanimir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stanimir-cos.md) (CN male human), an old man with the statistics of a [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) who has the following spells prepared:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> - Cantrips (at will): [friends](/compendium/spells/friends.md), [light](/compendium/spells/light.md), [mage hand](/compendium/spells/mage-hand.md), [prestidigitation](/compendium/spells/prestidigitation.md)
> - 1st level (4 slots): [charm person](/compendium/spells/charm-person.md), [mage armor](/compendium/spells/mage-armor.md), [shield](/compendium/spells/shield.md), [sleep](/compendium/spells/sleep.md)

> - 4th level (3 slots): [greater invisibility](/compendium/spells/greater-invisibility.md), [stoneskin](/compendium/spells/stoneskin.md)
> - 5th level (1 slot): [dominate person](/compendium/spells/dominate-person.md)
^086

[Stanimir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stanimir-cos.md) is joined by his daughter, Damia (CN female human [spy](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/vistana-spy-cos.md)), and his son, Ratka (CN male human [bandit captain](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/vistana-bandit-captain-cos.md)). Nine other Vistani (male and female [bandits](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/vistana-bandit-cos.md)) heed Ratka's commands. The six [draft horses](/compendium/bestiary/beast/draft-horse.md) are used to pull the Vistani wagons, which contain their belongings but nothing of value.

### The Dancing Fire

[Stanimir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stanimir-cos.md) introduces himself and welcomes the characters to his camp. If they deliver Duchess Morwen's warning, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> [Stanimir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stanimir-cos.md) laughs. "Don't worry. We have no wish to make enemies of Lady Morwen. I have a story to tell all of you. First you listen, then we go."
^089

If the characters agree to hear [Stanimir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stanimir-cos.md)'s story, he invites them to gather around the fire and hear his tale:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> [Stanimir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stanimir-cos.md) fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire. The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire's core.
> 
> "We come from an ancient land whose name is long forgotten—a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from our homes, and now we wander the lost roads."
> 
> The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.
> 
> [Stanimir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stanimir-cos.md) continues. "One night, a wounded soldier staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn't say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our own and followed him back toward his homeland. His enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we didn't give him up, even when their assassins fell upon us like wolves."
> 
> Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.
> 
> "This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he thanked us. He said, 'I owe you my life. Stay as long as you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will always be safe here.'"
> 
> The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.
> 
> [Stanimir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stanimir-cos.md)'s face becomes a somber mask. "A curse has befallen our noble prince, turning him into a tyrant. We alone have the power to leave his domain. We've traveled far and wide to find heroes such as yourselves to end our dread lord's curse and put his troubled soul to rest. Our leader, [Madam Eva](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-eva-cos.md), knows all. Will you return to Barovia with us and speak with her?"
^08a

These Vistani refuse to speak the name of their "dread lord" and provide no additional information. If the characters press them for details, the Vistani reply, "[Madam Eva](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-eva-cos.md) has the answers you seek."

If the characters agree to accompany the Vistani, the Vistani lead them south along the Trade Way. After several days of uneventful travel, the mists of Ravenloft engulf the caravan, transporting the characters and the Vistani to Barovia. The Vistani then lead the party safely to their leader, [Madam Eva](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-eva-cos.md), at area G (see chapter 2). The characters arrive at area A and are taken through areas B, E, and F on the way to [Madam Eva](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-eva-cos.md)'s camp. If the characters rid themselves of their Vistani hosts before reaching [Madam Eva](/compendium/bestiary/npc/madam-eva-cos.md)'s camp, they're on the own.

If the characters decline [Stanimir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/stanimir-cos.md)'s invitation, the Vistani are disappointed but leave as promised. A day or two later, use the "Creeping Fog" adventure hook or some variation of it to draw the characters into Barovia.

### Werewolves in the Mist

This adventure hook assumes you're running a campaign in or near Daggerford (see "Mysterious Visitors" for more information). It also assumes you're using the five player factions featured in the Adventurers League.

> "Werewolves in the mist!" You've heard these dreaded words spoken again and again by farmers, merchants, and adventurers alike. The hamlets east of Daggerford have fallen prey to a pack of werewolves that spills out of the Misty Forest on nights of the full moon, cloaked in crawling mist that seems to follow them wherever they go. The beasts spread death and mayhem, slaughtering adults and stealing children before retreating back into the woods. Others have tried to combat the werewolf menace, with little success.
^08c

The Misty Forest lies thirty miles east of Daggerford. Before the characters embark on their quest, those who have faction allegiances receive additional information described in the sections that follow. Take the players aside, and read them the boxed text for their faction.

#### Harpers

> A Harper named Zelraun Roaringhorn knows a metalsmith who will silver your weapons for free. He also provides some helpful magic.
> 
> "We strive to protect the powerless," he says. "If the children kidnapped by the werewolves are still alive, I would see them safely returned."
^08e

Zelraun Roaringhorn (LN male human [mage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) has come to Daggerford to meet with its ruler, Duchess Morwen, and offer the Harpers' support.

Zelraun gives each Harper character a spell scroll of [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md). He has also made arrangements with a metalsmith in Waterdeep to sheathe the characters' weapons in silver. The party can have up to six weapons silvered in this manner. Twenty pieces of ammunition count as one weapon for this purpose.

##### About the Harpers

The Harpers is a network of spellcasters and spies who advocate equality and who covertly oppose the abuse of power. The organization's longevity is largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the autonomy of its members. The Harpers have small cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms. They share information with one another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers' ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their ingenuity and incorruptibility.

#### Order of the Gauntlet

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You met with the heads of the Order of the Gauntlet chapter house in Waterdeep. They've stationed members of the order at various inns and homesteads east of Daggerford, so that locals need not fear the night. Now they're counting on you to find the werewolves' lair in the Misty Forest. Only then can the order mount an organized assault. As you prepare to depart, a [knight of the order](/compendium/bestiary/undead/knight-of-the-order-cos.md) named Lanniver Strayl offers you his blessing.
^091

Lanniver Strayl (LG male human [knight](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md)), a devout follower of Tyr recently arrived in Daggerford, gives a [potion of heroism](/compendium/items/potion-of-heroism.md) to each member of the order in the party.

##### About the Order of the Gauntlet

Founded by paladins and clerics of Helm, Torm, and Tyr, the order is a dedicated group of like-minded individuals driven by religious zeal or a finely honed sense of justice and honor. The order is ready to lash out the moment evil acts, and not a moment before. The order strikes hard and fast, without waiting for the blessings of temples or the permission of rulers. The order believes that evil must be smashed, or it will swiftly overcome all.

#### Emerald Enclave

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You don't need to consult with others in the Emerald Enclave to know that the werewolves are upsetting the natural order. For balance to be restored, they must be eradicated. It seems the gods of nature agree, for they've sent good weather and preserved the monsters' tracks.
^094

Members of the Emerald Enclave in the party gain inspiration whenever the party kills a werewolf.

##### About the Emerald Enclave

This widespread group of wilderness survivalists preserves the natural order while rooting out unnatural threats. Druids, rangers, and barbarians make up most of its membership.

Branches of the organization can be found wherever untamed wilderness exists. Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive, and more important, they want to help others do the same. They aren't opposed to civilization or progress, but they strive to prevent civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another.

#### Lords' Alliance

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A Lords' Alliance operative from Waterdeep named Eravien Haund comes to Daggerford bearing news that alliance agents have not only captured one of the werewolves but also conducted a thorough interrogation before putting the creature out of its misery.
^097

Eravien Haund (LN male half-elf [noble](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) imparts the following information to fellow Lords' Alliance members and tells them not to share it:

- The werewolf pack has almost a dozen members. The leader of the pack is a man named Kiril.
- The werewolves come from a distant land called Barovia. The Lords' Alliance has no information about it.
- The werewolves worship a deity called Mother Night.
- The werewolves leave and return to Barovia through some kind of ancient portal. (This is a deduction on Eravien's part, based on the werewolf prisoner's vague description of how the pack gets to and from Barovia.)

Eravien believes that he can gain prestige within the Lords' Alliance if he learns the whereabouts of the "ancient portal" that the werewolves are using and destroys it. He is convinced that the portal represents a danger not only to Daggerford but also to Waterdeep. Any Lords' Alliance character who agrees to destroy it is given a spell scroll of [magic weapon](/compendium/spells/magic-weapon.md). Eravien also promises to furnish the character with a letter of recommendation (see ""Marks of Prestige"" in chapter 7 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide") once the portal is destroyed.

##### About the Lords' Alliance

The Lords' Alliance is a coalition of political powers concerned with their mutual security and prosperity. Heading the coalition are rulers in the North and along the Sword Coast.

Although alliance members have pledged to join forces against common threats, every lord in it places the fate and fortune of his or her settlement above all others. Agents of the alliance are chosen primarily for their loyalty, and are trained in observation, stealth, innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy, they carry well-made equipment (often disguised to appear common). Alliance operatives are often glory hounds.

#### Zhentarim

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The Black Network sees the werewolf menace as an opportunity to provide lords and nervous landowners with mercenaries to protect their holdings. But at least one of your fellow members has a grudge against the lycanthropes. Davra Jassur, a member of the Zhentarim based in Waterdeep, arranges a private meeting with you.
^09a

Davra Jassur (LE female human [assassin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) poses as a recruiter for the Black Network but is, in fact, a cutthroat who quietly disposes of competitors. Her husband, Yarak, was also a member of the Black Network. He was escorting a caravan traveling from Daggerford to the Way Inn (about sixty miles southeast of Daggerford, along the Trade Way) when the werewolves attacked. Yarak was slain, and Davra wants revenge; she wants the head of the werewolf pack leader. She is too tied up with "business" to engage in a personal vendetta, but if another member of the Black Network were to help, she would owe that individual a special favor (see ""Marks of Prestige"" in chapter 7 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

##### About the Zhentarim

The Zhentarim is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence throughout the Forgotten Realms. The public face of the Black Network appears relatively benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, both legal and illicit, hoping to undercut its competitors.

Members of the Zhentarim think of themselves as members of an extended family and rely on it for resources and security. At the same time, members are granted the autonomy to increase their own wealth and influence. As a whole, the Zhentarim promises "the best for the best," although in truth the organization is more interested in spreading its own propaganda and influence than investing in the improvement of its members.

#### Welcome to Barovia

Strahd is using the werewolves to lure adventurers to his domain. Characters can follow the werewolves' tracks into the Misty Forest. After hours of fruitless searching, the characters are engulfed by thick fog:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The woods darken as the trees begin to close ranks, their needle-covered arms interlocking to blot out the sun. The shroud of mist that covers the ground turns into creeping walls of gray fog that silently envelop you until you can't see more than a few feet in any direction. Soon, even the werewolf tracks disappear.
^09d

No matter which direction they go, the characters come to a lonely dirt road that cuts through the woods, leading to area A (see chapter 2). As an alternative, you can have them enter Barovia near Krezk (see chapter 8).

### Creeping Fog

This scenario assumes that the characters are camping in a forest when the fog engulfs them. They are quietly borne to the edge of Barovia.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The woods are quiet this night, and the air grows chill. Your fire sputters as a low mist gathers around the edges of your camp, growing closer as the night wears on. By morning, the fog hangs thick in the air, turning the trees around you into gray ghosts. Then you notice these aren't the same trees that surrounded you the night before.
^09f

No matter which direction they go, the characters come to a lonely dirt road that cuts through the woods, leading to area A (see chapter 2). As an alternative, you can have them enter Barovia near Krezk (see chapter 8).
