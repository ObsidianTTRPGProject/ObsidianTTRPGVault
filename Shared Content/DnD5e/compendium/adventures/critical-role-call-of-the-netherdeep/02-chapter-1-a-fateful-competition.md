# Chapter 1: A Fateful Competition
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep* 

Like many of the heroic legends that echo throughout the annals of Exandrian history, this tale begins in peace—or what passes for peace in Jigow at festival time. Goblin children run through the streets, screaming with mirth, while orcs, humans, drow, and people of countless other folk clink tankards, hurl hatchets at targets, stuff their faces with meat pies, and plunge into the frigid waters of the Ifolon River—all in the name of friendly competition.

The characters are in Jigow during the city's annual Festival of Merit. Though they are the protagonists of this story, today they are but a small handful of excited festivalgoers amid a merry throng. Many of the Xhorhasians present are famed warriors, skilled athletes, cunning con artists, and talented arcanists. Among those taking part in the festivities are the characters' rivals, another group of adventurers whose fates are entwined with the characters.

At the festival's end, the characters and their rivals are chosen to dive into the waters of the Emerald Gulch in search of a prize. Little do they know that this plunge will start them on an adventure greater than any of them could possibly imagine.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter has two parts: the Festival of Merit and the Emerald Grotto. Each part can be played in a single 3- to 4-hour session. Be sure to review the information about the rival nonplayer characters in the "Rivals" section of the introduction before running this chapter. The rivals' interactions with the characters in this chapter will lay the groundwork for relationships that could last throughout the adventure.

The first half of the chapter is a lighthearted and free-form exploration of Jigow and the Festival of Merit. Familiarize yourself with the map of Jigow and the locations keyed to it so that you can effectively guide the characters as they explore the settlement and partake in the festival games.

The second part is a dangerous but straightforward dungeon delve into the Emerald Grotto near Jigow. The characters must overcome a series of challenges to reach the treasure at the end of the dungeon before the rivals do.

### Rival Impressions

Whenever a rival is present for an event in this chapter, a "Rival Impressions" section explains how that individual might react to the characters' actions. These suggestions will help you develop the relationships between the rivals and the characters. The evolution of a fierce rivalry into a friendship—or even a romance—is an exciting way to enhance the ongoing story of this adventure. Conversely, a friendship crumbling because of a breakdown in communication or a clash of two unbending ideals is a tragedy that echoes the darker tones of this adventure.

A character can try to change a rival's attitude through roleplaying, which you can adjudicate based on the "social interaction rules" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide". You can also improvise and adjust the rivals' attitudes at your discretion, based on how you feel the rivals would react in any given situation.

## Jigow

Jigow is located in northern Xhorhas on the banks of the Emerald Gulch and the Ifolon River. An amalgamation of coastal villages that were originally settled by several nomadic clans of orcs and goblins, Jigow is now home to humans and other folk as well, and the city gained a significant drow population after Jigow became a part of the Kryn Dynasty.

The villages and townships that make up Jigow are loosely divided into three major areas: the Meatwaters, the main dock area on the shores of the Ifolon River; the Wetwalks, a collection of houses on stilts closest to the wetlands and marshes; and the Jumble, the most densely populated region of the city, where houses are built among giant mangrove trees or on the backs of horizonback tortoises and used as traveling homes.

Jigow has a council of elders who help its people resolve internal conflicts and a military presence in the form of the Aurora Watch—the soldiers of the Kryn Dynasty. The dynasty also has a political liaison in Jigow: a drow named Durth Mirimm (see area J9). Serving as an intermediary between Jigow's elders and the court of the Bright Queen Leylas Kryn, Durth cares more about what Jigow can do for the dynasty than how he can improve the lives of Jigow's citizens.

The Jumble is the heart of Jigow and home to a colorful patchwork of local cultures. The traditions of ancient Xhorhasian peoples, many of them orcs and goblins, live on in the peaceful chaos of the Jumble. The twisting, unplanned streets give the district its name—a medley of homes, shops, workshops, athletic fields, amphitheaters, shrines, taverns, stables, and public spaces for lively gatherings.

Jigow was built from the sweat of its founders' brows, the strength of their muscles, and the music of their voices. In Jigow, any chance to show off one's physical, social, or intellectual prowess is a welcome one, and there's no opportunity better than the annual festival. On this day, friendly and not-so-friendly contests between residents are settled. Every public space is filled with festival games, food stalls, or other amenities for the merrymakers, and plenty of shops and private residences have flung their doors wide to join in the revelry.

## Adventure Start

This story begins as the characters enter the Jumble. Read or paraphrase the boxed text below to set the scene:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You have entered the Jumble, a large district of tangled roads and single-story buildings in the town of Jigow. Throngs of people, most of them orcs and goblins, move through the streets, laughing, singing, running, and sightseeing. All are enthralled by the raucous sights and sounds of the town's Festival of Merit.
> 
> You hear snippets of conversations as people pass by: a goblin mother telling her children not to go near the baby horizonback tortoises, a drow guard in shining insectile armor complaining to his partner that his gauntlet was crushed by a hulking orc while arm-wrestling, and a pair of young orcs in swimwear hollering as they rush toward the banks of the Ifolon River.
> 
> All around you, colorful signs and banners point toward festival booths surrounded by cheering people. On this street alone, you can see a meat-pie eating contest near a shop mounted on the back of a massive tortoise, and on the other side of the road, a banner emblazoned with the words "Riddles and Rhymes: Unbeatable Riddles!" That banner points toward a three-story temple in the center of the Jumble. The town is yours to explore—where do you want to go?
^041

### Festival of Merit

Seven festival games and challenges are described in this chapter, as follows:

- **J1 Best Pies in the Jumble..** The Unbroken Tusk inn boasts the best meat pies east of the Ashkeeper Peaks. Its owner has offered a prize to the person who can eat the most pies.
- **J2 One-Shot Solution..** A maze has been constructed in the Jumble. Competitors win a prize if they navigate the maze in one try without coming upon a dead end.
- **J3 The Ifolon Plunge..** Some distance offshore in the Ifolon River, a rusted spear is lodged into a weathered piece of a pier that has long since rotted away. It is a popular spot for Jigow's most talented swimmers to test their speed and skill.
- **J4 Call to Arms..** One of the Aurora Watch soldiers stationed in Jigow has challenged anyone and everyone to best her in an arm-wrestling contest. So far, she remains undefeated.
- **J5 Wetwalks Paddywhack..** Members of the Gakthash and Uvuroh goblin clans time their rice paddy harvests to coincide with the Festival of Merit every year. This event turns the mundane act of harvesting into a spirited competition.
- **J6 Herding the Horizonbacks..** This year's brood of young horizonback tortoises must be relocated from the Wetwalks to the Jumble.
- **J7 Riddles and Rhymes..** One of Jigow's elders is fond of making up riddles. He has come up with several new ones for the festival this year.

Each of these challenges is described in greater detail in its own section. Except where otherwise noted, any number of characters can participate in an event.

The characters might want to look for a particular type of game: a contest of athleticism, a test of puzzle-solving, or a trial of endurance. In that case, they must spend a half-hour strolling through the streets in search of the type of challenge they're looking for.

#### Medals of Merit Cards

A character who wins a festival contest earns one of seven different magical medals. Each medal is described in appendix B, and its description also appears on a card in appendix C. You can hand a copy of this card to each player whose character won the medal.

### Locations in Jigow

The following locations are keyed to the map of Jigow. They include places where Festival of Merit contests are staged (areas J1 through J7) and other important locations that the characters might visit (areas J8 through J10).

#### J1: Best Pies in the Jumble

This contest tests the participants' perseverance and endurance. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The savory scents of meat, pastry, and spices fill the air around a three-story building mounted on the back of a gigantic tortoise. A cooking stand and a festival stage with a long table are set up at the tortoise's feet, where an orc stands over a massive oven. She bustles from the oven to the stage and back, placing delicious-looking hand pies at each seat and stacking more of them on a cooling rack nearby.
> 
> People are already gathered on stage, including a scrawny young human with a mop of brown hair and a scruffy beard. As you approach, the orc calls out in a melodic baritone, "Come to sample the best meat pies this side of the Wastes, yes? I sell 'em for meals up there, but I'm running pie-eating contests down here all day, if you've got an orc-sized stomach."
^046

[Agathe Silverspoon](/compendium/bestiary/npc/agathe-silverspoon-crcotn.md) is a chaotic good [orc](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) who moves from counter to counter, deftly slicing a variety of cooked and spiced meats, then folding them into piecrusts that she places into the oven behind her.

Agathe gestures toward the raised platform next to her cooking station, where three people are already seated: a cocky male [drow](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md) flexing his muscles, pointing at people in the gathering crowd and winking; a female halfling (use the [thug](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) stat block), sitting very still with a smirk on her face; and a young male human, scanning the crowd as if looking for someone. This individual is [Irvan Wastewalker (tier 1)](/compendium/bestiary/npc/irvan-wastewalker-tier-1-crcotn.md), whose stat block appears in appendix A. These contestants have the following modifiers to their Constitution checks and saving throws, which come into play during the pie-eating contest:

- **Male Drow.** +0
- **Female Halfling.** +2
- **Irvan Wastewalker.** +1 on checks, +3 on saving throws

##### Putting Away the Pies

It costs 5 sp to enter this contest. On Agathe's signal, everyone seated at the platform can begin eating. The pies taste great, the meat seasoned to perfection and the crusts light and fluffy. Of course, there's not much chance to savor the flavor of the pies when the goal is to put away as many of them as possible.

All contestants can easily eat their first pie, requiring no check. Eating a second pie requires a successful DC 8 Constitution check. For every pie after the second, the DC increases by 2. The person who eats the most pies before failing a check is the winner (ties are possible). A contestant whose check fails is too full to continue eating and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the contestant becomes [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour and feels queasy.

##### Meeting Irvan

Irvan sits next to one of the characters during the contest. If they speak to him before the contest begins, he merely wishes the character good luck. He talks more after the contest.

##### Rival Impressions

Win or lose, Irvan is friendly toward characters who competed in the contest. His friendliness evaporates quickly if a character insults his scruffy and adolescent appearance.

As a new member of his adventuring party, Irvan isn't keen on revealing that he's part of a group. But he does invite any of the characters that he's friendly with to join him for the festival's closing ceremony at sunset.

##### Treasure

Each winner of this contest receives a tin [medal of the meat pie](/compendium/items/medal-of-the-meat-pie-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) shaped like—you guessed it—a meat pie.

Win or lose, a character can't compete in this contest again until they complete a long rest.

#### J2: One-Shot Solution

This game tests one's memory and navigation skills. To begin, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Near the entrance to the festival grounds, a maze has been constructed out of four-foot-tall walls of wooden planks lashed together with ropes and propped up between sandbags. Banners are hung over the openings to the maze, signifying the entrance and the exit. The passageways of the maze are five feet wide. Off to the side, a tan-feathered aarakocra sits on a chair thirty feet above the ground, giving him a vantage point where he can see the whole area.
> 
> A small crowd is cheering on and heckling the people inside. Near the entrance, an ogre in leather armor is encouraging a reluctant goblin in a breastplate to give the maze a try.
^04d

The way to win is to study the maze from the outside, and then follow the only correct path to the exit in one shot. If a creature reaches a dead end, the judge—a lawful neutral [aarakocra](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/aarakocra.md) named Sharpwatch—swoops down and plucks them from the maze.

[Maggie Keeneyes (tier 1)](/compendium/bestiary/npc/maggie-keeneyes-tier-1-crcotn.md), whose stat block appears in appendix A, has figured out the solution to the maze, but the ogre's size keeps her from entering the maze. She wants her friend, a goblin named [Dermot Wurder (tier 1)](/compendium/bestiary/npc/dermot-wurder-tier-1-crcotn.md), whose stat block also appears in appendix A, to go in her place. Dermot, however, is convinced that even with her instructions, he will come to a dead end.

##### Studying the Maze

A character can study the maze from the outside and make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If this check succeeds, the character has advantage on the check made to navigate the maze.

##### Entering the Maze

It costs 3 sp to participate in this challenge. When a character enters the maze, they must make a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to try to find the correct path. On a success, the character traverses the maze in one shot and emerges victorious on the other side.

On a failed check, the character gets lost and ends up in one of the maze's dead ends. A lost character can make a DC 18 Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to try to backtrack quickly out of the dead end, avoiding Sharpwatch's notice on a success; the character can then make another Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to navigate the maze. If either of these checks is a failure, Sharpwatch swoops down and plucks the character from the maze, depositing them outside.

A character can try the maze as many times as they would like, paying the 3 sp entrance fee each time.

##### Meeting Maggie and Dermot

After the event, Maggie approaches a character who successfully navigated the maze and congratulates them. Dermot follows up, introducing himself and asking if the characters can help him with a small task:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "It's nothing urgent," he says, "but if you find my friend Ayo, would you tell her Dermot's wondering what the plan is after the closing ceremony? She has dark hair and blue skin. She said she was going to compete in a contest by the river—I think."
^051

Ayo Jabe can be found competing in area J3.

##### Rival Impressions

Dermot thinks the best of people and is friendly toward anyone who encourages him to walk the maze or who backs him up by saying he should sit it out. Both Dermot and Maggie are hostile toward characters who insult them—especially if anyone makes fun of the fact that Maggie is too big to navigate the maze or implies that she lacks insight because she's a musclebound ogre.

##### Treasure

Characters who complete the maze are awarded a [medal of the maze](/compendium/items/medal-of-the-maze-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) made of smooth driftwood, hung on a piece of rough twine. A labyrinthine pattern has been carved into the front of the medal.

#### J3: The Ifolon Plunge

This swimming race pits competitors against the surging current and sharks of the Ifolon River. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Several people are gathered on the piers, arguing among themselves and venting their ire at a spry goblin who responds to their anger with an amused expression. Suddenly, a brash voice cuts through the chatter, and a blue-skinned woman pushes her way through the crowd and stands protectively in front of the goblin, yelling, "She's not gonna say it again! If you're here with a team, only one member of your team can participate in the challenge! The rules are clear, and if you can't handle it, get off the pier!" After just a couple of seconds, small groups of people begin to quietly murmur among themselves.
^055

The game is refereed by an impassive, lawful neutral [goblin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) named Omo.

The blue-skinned individual is a water genasi named [Ayo Jabe (tier 1)](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ayo-jabe-tier-1-crcotn.md), whose stat block appears in appendix A. After breaking up the argument on the docks, she returns to her companion, an elegant drow in wizard's robes. This is [Galsariad Ardyth (tier 1)](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galsariad-ardyth-tier-1-crcotn.md), whose stat block also appears in appendix A.

Ayo and Galsariad exchange a few terse words before Ayo motions toward the pier. A character who eavesdrops on them can make a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. On a success, the character learns that the drow offered to cast a [longstrider](/compendium/spells/longstrider.md) spell on the genasi, but she declined; she wants to win on her own.

##### Participating in the Challenge

Entering this contest costs 5 sp. The goal of this challenge is to swim upstream through the rushing waters of the Ifolon to reach a rusted spear sticking out of a rotten wooden post, then bring the spear back to the dock.

Only one of the characters can participate in this challenge. If multiple characters from the party want to take part, anyone after the first must make a DC 14 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. A character who succeeds on this check can compete; those who fail the check are ejected from the pier by Omo.

Other than Ayo, the contestants are a lanky male orc [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), a broad-shouldered female human [thug](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md), and a surly male [goblin](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md). These nonplayer characters have the following modifiers to their Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks, which come into play during the swimming contest:

- **Ayo Jabe.** +4
- **Male Orc.** +0
- **Female Human.** +2
- **Male Goblin.** −1

##### Race for the Spear

On Omo's mark, the contestants plunge into the water and begin swimming. Competitors roll initiative when they dive into the water, with all participants expected to use the dash||Dash action every round. Any contestant who moves more than 30 feet on their turn must make a DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check at the end of that turn. On a failed check, the contestant gains 1 level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) and is pushed 15 feet downstream as they are pummeled by the current.

The distance from the pier to the spear is 75 feet, and it takes an action to wrench the spear free. A character can pull the spear out of another contestant's hands by swimming to within 5 feet of them and succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to 10 + the other contestant's Strength modifier. Whoever returns the spear to Omo is the winner.

##### Danger from Below

After the spear is pulled from the rotten post, two Ifolon striped sharks (use the [reef shark](/compendium/bestiary/beast/reef-shark.md) stat block) emerge from the depths of the river. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 13 or higher notice the water churning more severely as the sharks, riled up by the antics of the swimmers, rise to feed.

Roll initiative for the sharks. They attack contest participants indiscriminately, interested in scoring what they think is an easy meal. A shark tries to flee when it has been reduced to 11 hit points or fewer. Ayo doesn't waste time fighting the sharks; her only goal is to reach the finish line (with the spear, if she isn't already holding it). The other contestants in the water try to fend off the sharks.

##### Meeting Ayo and Galsariad

Prior to the challenge, Ayo is focused on the race and politely brushes off any attempt at conversation. Once the characters are safe and sound on the pier after the race, she and Galsariad approach them.

##### Rival Impressions

Ayo is impressed more by courage and determination than by success. If a character participated in the contest but failed to recover the spear, she claps that character on the shoulder with a crooked grin on her face and says, "I've never seen anyone give it their all like that before. 'Cept for myself, I mean." She goes on to tell the character that she has assembled an adventuring party, and that she'd like to introduce everyone after the festival's closing ceremony at sundown.

Ayo looks poorly on a character who broke the rules of the contest to participate. Galsariad, however, quietly smiles and inclines his head at that character, impressed by their cunning.

##### Treasure

Omo awards the winner a [medal of the conch](/compendium/items/medal-of-the-conch-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) made of sea glass that has been magically crafted into the shape of a conch shell.

#### J4: Call to Arms

This arm-wrestling competition tests a character's strength and determination. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You approach a brick building with a sign that reads, "Beefslab Butchers." A simple table and two chairs have been set up outside. Both chairs are currently occupied by people wearing the armor of the Aurora Watch, their elbows braced against the table and their hands locked in an arm-wrestling duel. Two dozen festivalgoers watch them silently, until—SLAM!—the occupant of the left chair pushes her opponent's arm to the table and the crowd erupts in whoops and cheers.
^05d

The victor in this contest, and the defending champion of the event, is Maryl Bronzefang, a lawful neutral, orc [gladiator](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md). A native of Jigow serving in Bazzoxan's Aurora Watch, she was given leave to return home for the festival. She is flanked by two compatriots, both female drow [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) clad in chitinous splint armor. A quiet male goblin [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)—Vars, the owner of the butcher shop—sits off to the side, managing the wagers made by onlookers.

After prodding Dermot to try the maze in area J2, Maggie Keeneyes can be found here, eager to compete.

Entering this contest is free, though bystanders can talk to Vars to place bets on the participants.

Maryl Bronzefang competes only against the best, and to challenge her, a character must first defeat one of her drow companions. Maryl returns to the table after at least one character has accomplished this, casting a challenging grin at the victor and inviting them to try their luck against her. The first character to defeat Maryl receives a challenge from Maggie. Otherwise, Maggie challenges Maryl after all other contestants fall by the wayside. These nonplayer characters have the following modifiers to their Strength checks, which come into play during the arm-wrestling contest:

- **Maggie Keeneyes.** +4
- **Maryl Bronzefang.** +4
- **Female Drow.** +3

##### Contest Rules

In any arm-wrestling match, have both contestants make a Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check with a DC equal to 10 + the other contestant's Strength modifier. If one contestant succeeds and the other fails, the one who succeeded wins the match. Repeat the checks as needed until one contestant fails and the other succeeds.

A character who loses a match and wants to try again must first succeed on a DC 15 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a failed check, the character is laughed away by the crowd. If a character loses to the same foe twice, that contestant declines any further challenges from that character.

##### Betting

A character can place a bet with Vars by handing him 5 sp and declaring who they think will win the next match. A character whose choice wins the match receives 9 sp, and Vars pockets 1 sp.

##### Treasure

Vars hands anyone who bests Maryl and Maggie a [medal of muscle](/compendium/items/medal-of-muscle-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) made of ebony and shaped like a flexing arm. If one stares at it for long enough, the muscles appear to bulge.

#### J5: Wetwalks Paddywhack

This game requires teamwork and skill with a blade. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> On the eastern edge of the Jumble, the docks rise upward from the river to run alongside wooden shacks built on stilts, casting crooked shadows over the wetlands below. Some areas of the wetlands have been cordoned off to create rice paddies, which are now ready for harvest.
> 
> Blue and green banners wave over one end of the docks, where two elderly goblin farmers preside over the contest. "You know how it goes!" one hollers out in a reedy voice. "First team to harvest the rice from their section wins!"
^062

This event is managed by two neutral good [goblins](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) named Beetle and Zag. Their farm is jointly run by the Gakthash and Uvuroh goblin clans, and every year, the goblin couple uses the festival competitions as a labor-saving way to harvest their crops.

After the pie-eating contest in area J1, Irvan can also be found relaxing here.

##### Harvesting the Rice

A team of two is required to participate in this contest, and there is no entry fee. If a character needs a partner, Irvan grudgingly volunteers to be their teammate for the event. When a team enters the contest, they are asked to designate which is the cutter (who cuts the stalks down) and which is the gatherer (who gathers the stalks and prepares them for drying). Zag provides the cutter with a sickle before Beetle directs the teams to the paddies and asks them to await the signal to start.

Each team is responsible for a 20-foot-long, 5-foot-wide strip of a paddy. On Beetle's signal, the teams race to successfully harvest their strip. Aside from the characters, two other teams are competing in this race: an imposing female [orc](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) and her rambunctious son (who uses the [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block); and a pair of [drow](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md) siblings, who wear broad-brimmed straw hats and constantly bicker with each other. These teams have the following modifiers to their Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) and Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) checks, which come into play during the contest:

##### Orc Team

[Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics) +3, [Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand) +0

##### Drow Team

[Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics) +0, [Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand) +2

At the end of each minute, each team's cutter must make a DC 11 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check; on a success, the cutter clears a 5-foot-square section of their paddy. Once a section has been cleared, the team's gatherer must spend 1 minute trying to gather and bundle the shorn rice, doing so with a successful DC 11 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check; a failed check causes the team's cutter to make their next Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check with disadvantage, as the gatherer's bundling work gets in the way. The first team to clear and bundle the rice from all four 5-foot squares of their strip of paddy wins (ties are possible).

##### Treasure

Beetle and Zag award each member of the winning team a copper [medal of the wetlands](/compendium/items/medal-of-the-wetlands-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) engraved with a sheaf of rice, hung on a necklace woven of reeds.

#### J6: Herding the Horizonbacks

This challenge tests the participants' acrobatic ability and skill with handling animals. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Festivalgoers are clustered around a paddock full of young horizonback tortoises that are shuffling around inside the enclosure. The fifteen-foot-tall tortoises are being tended by young herders, who are fitting them with makeshift bridles. These individuals are overseen by a tall, attractive orc who makes sure the bridles are attached correctly.
> 
> The orc waves at you and says, "Have you come to join the horizonback migration? There's a tortoise for each of you, and a medal to be won if you make it to the end in one piece. Last year we had to rebuild three houses after the festival!"
^068

After the Ifolon Plunge in area J3, Ayo Jabe can be found relaxing here, watching the tortoises. She laughs at characters who refuse the challenge.

The paddock is maintained by a horizonback tortoise trainer named Adan, a lawful good, orc [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md). Adan supervises the transfer of the young tortoises from the paddock to the open fields on the west side of the Jumble, where the tortoises will begin training to become mounts and mobile buildings for the tribes of Jigow.

A [young horizonback tortoise](/compendium/bestiary/beast/young-horizonback-tortoise-crcotn.md) uses the [ankylosaurus](/compendium/bestiary/beast/ankylosaurus.md) stat block, with these changes:

- The tortoise can breathe air and water.
- It understands Goblin but can't speak.
- It has Bite attack that is identical to the ankylosaurus's Tail attack, except that it deals piercing damage.

There are as many tortoises available as there are characters who want to participate in this event. Attached to the front edge of each tortoise's shell is a makeshift seat big enough for a single rider.

##### Maneuvering the Herd

Once all the contestants are seated on their tortoises, Adan climbs onto the back of a larger tortoise outside the paddock. With a yell and a hand signal, Adan begins to lead the group of tortoises out of the paddock.

To successfully maneuver a tortoise to the destination, a character must make three successful Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) checks. The DC for these checks begins at 12 and increases by 1 for each check thereafter. On a failed check, the tortoise tries to buck the character from its back. The character must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall from the tortoise and take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. On a successful check, the character doesn't fall and can try to maneuver the tortoise again.

After a failed saving throw, a character can mount their tortoise by succeeding on a DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If this check fails, the belligerent tortoise makes a Bite attack against the character. Once mounted on the tortoise again, a character can continue trying to move the tortoise along by making another Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check as described above.

If a tortoise is [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by an [animal friendship](/compendium/spells/animal-friendship.md) spell or a similar effect, Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) checks to guide it are made with advantage, and it won't buck its handler on a failed check.

##### Treasure

Once a tortoise reaches its destination, Adan awards its rider a [medal of the horizonback](/compendium/items/medal-of-the-horizonback-crcotn.md) (see appendix B).

No two medals awarded from this contest look the same. Each one appears to be made from some different part of a tortoise: a piece of shell, a claw, or a tooth. Adan assures the characters that these medals were made from tortoises that died naturally.

#### J7: Riddles and Rhymes

This event challenges a character's intellect with a series of riddles. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An elderly goblin in blue robes presides over a set of three tables. One table holds a wooden box, the second displays a glittering star map of the Exandrian sky, and on the third rests a row of colored bottles. A banner hanging over the setup reads, "Test your wit with me, against these riddles three."
^06c

Elder Colbu Kaz, a chaotic neutral, goblin [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md), created these three puzzles. Each attempt to answer one riddle costs 2 sp. Answering at least two of the riddles correctly is enough to win the contest (see "Treasure" below). Various other challengers are trying to solve the riddles, including Galsariad Ardyth. This clever drow solves two of the riddles after a total of four guesses. If the characters solve each riddle on the first try, he is impressed (see "Meeting Galsariad" below).

##### Table 1: The Box's Riddle

On this table are a locked wooden box and four metal keys. On a placard beside the box is written the following riddle in Common:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Bronze, copper, silver, gold—Ancient ones from tales of old. Match the key to the box's lock; A mistaken choice begets a shock.
^06e

A character who inspects the keys can see that each is made of a different metal—one bronze, one copper, one silver, and one gold. Close examination of the box reveals that its lock is shaped like a dragon with a fluted crest, and the edges of the box are decorated with engravings of pearls and shells.

The lock's shape and sea-themed decorations are clues that suggest a bronze dragon—and thus, it's the bronze key that opens the lock. A character who inserts the incorrect key or tries to pick the lock must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 (1d4) lightning damage as the lock emits an electric shock.

A character can make a DC 10 Intelligence check to recognize that the metallic hues of the keys and the first two lines of the riddle are talking about not just metals but also types of metallic dragons. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check recognizes the shape of the dragon lock or the box's aquatic decorations as indicative of a bronze dragon; if a character saw someone get shocked by lightning after an incorrect guess, the DC for this check is reduced to 11.

##### Table 2: The Star Map's Riddle

The star map resting on this table depicts the moons and constellations visible in the Exandrian night sky, accompanied by the following riddle in Common:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Two birds sit in a speckled field, One silver and calm, one scarlet with woe. Nigh all year, the red one yields To silver's illusions, mischief, and shelt'ring glow.
^070

To answer the riddle, a character must identify the "birds" of the riddle and point them out on the star map. The answer is the twin moons of Exandria, Catha and Ruidus.

A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History) or [Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recalls the stories regarding Exandria's moons, recognizing the second line as referring to the superstitions surrounding Ruidus and the last line as referring to the divine portfolio of Sehanine the Moon Weaver. A character who succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check determines that there is only one red object on the star map—Ruidus.

##### Table 3: The Bottles' Riddle

On this table is a row of seven small bottles filled with colored liquids, and the following riddle in Common:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Two of us are brewed from blight And always sat to purple's right. Three are juice, one burns like flame, And no two colors taste the same. Even flasks hold naught but pain, And shade of sky will leave a stain. Though tasty are those at each end, Neither is the winner's friend. A puzzle for the keen and wise, Drink the light to claim your prize.
^072

The bottles, numbered from left to right, have the following contents:

- **Bottle 1..** This purple bottle is filled with berry juice.
- **Bottle 2..** This green bottle is filled with blight brew. A character who sips from this bottle must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute, spending the time retching.
- **Bottle 3..** This sky-blue bottle is filled with berry juice.
- **Bottle 4..** This white bottle is filled with overwhelmingly spicy pepper oil. A character who sips from this bottle must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1 fire damage from the spice.
- **Bottle 5..** This purple bottle is filled with a liquid known in Jigow as glow potion. A character who drinks from this bottle feels warmth settle in their stomach as their skin emits dim silvery light out to a range of 5 feet for 1 minute.
- **Bottle 6..** This green bottle is filled with blight brew, just like bottle 2.
- **Bottle 7..** This red bottle is filled with apple juice.

A character must drink from the correct bottle to win, and anyone who attempts the challenge has only two chances to guess correctly. If someone guesses incorrectly twice, they fail this riddle. Bottle 5, containing the glow potion, is the correct bottle.

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence check comes to one of the following conclusions:

- Bottles 2 and 6 are both directly to the right of a purple bottle and thus must contain blight brew.
- Bottles 2, 4, and 6—the "even" ones—should be avoided, as they hold only "pain."
- If the sky-blue bottle leaves a "stain," it must be harmless juice, but not the correct answer.
- The first and last bottles must also be juice, as they are "tasty" but won't win the riddle.

Characters can make multiple Intelligence checks to gain multiple hints, but a character who fails a check can't make another until they drink from a bottle.

A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or similar effect also reveals the fifth bottle to be the only one containing magical liquid.

##### Meeting Galsariad

If the characters didn't meet him at the Ifolon Plunge in area J3, Galsariad Ardyth approaches the characters after they're done with this challenge, win or lose.

##### Rival Impressions

Unless the characters solve each riddle on the first try, Galsariad brusquely brushes past them, chuckling, "Better luck next time." Nonetheless, he is impressed by characters who display a ruthless drive to succeed. If this is the case, he inclines his head and says, "Your cunning is a cut above that of everyone else in this backwater. Do you plan on participating in the grand finale at sundown? I'd be interested in testing my wits against you."

##### Treasure

If a character answers at least two of the riddles correctly, Elder Colbu Kaz awards that character a [medal of wit](/compendium/items/medal-of-wit-crcotn.md) (see appendix B), which is sculpted and painted to look like the head of a fox.

#### J8: Temple of the Luxon

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls of this three-story temple are crafted from semitranslucent glass that seems to glow with its own faint light. The building, which is shaped like a dodecahedron, is dedicated to the Luxon, the First Radiance and patron deity of the Kryn Dynasty.
^077

The temple is maintained by Belana Zolaed, a neutral good drow [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) who also conducts worship ceremonies.

After the One-Shot Solution contest (see area J2), Dermot can be found here, reciting traditional prayers to the Luxon and committing them to memory.

#### J9: Helter-Skelter

Though official records call this wood-and-stone complex the Dynasty Outpost, the rebellious folk of Jigow have nicknamed it "Helter-Skelter" for the chaotic environment that the Kryn officers often descend into when dealing with the ornery youngsters—and not-so-youngsters—of the town.

The complex consists of two main structures: a low wooden barracks that houses the guards of the Aurora Watch stationed in Jigow, and a two-story stone dodecahedral building that is the residence of Durth Mirimm, a lawful neutral [drow elite warrior](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/drow-elite-warrior.md) who is the Taskhand of the Aurora Watch. Durth governs the settlement alongside the two clan elders, Colbu Kaz and Ushru.

#### J10: Black Islands

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Black basalt islands rise in jagged ridges from the waters of the Ifolon River.
^07a

Visitors and natives alike enjoy mingling, chatting, and watching the sun set over the river waters from the peaks of these islands. The smallest island contains the entrance to the Emerald Grotto.

### Final Contest

Once the characters have participated in as many competitions as they want to, or at a time you feel is appropriate, the sun begins to set, and the sound of rhythmic drumming echoes throughout the Jumble, summoning the participants to the paddock (area J6), which has been cleared of horizonback tortoises. Elder Ushru, a neutral good orc [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md), stands in the middle of the road atop a platform of wooden crates. When all the festival officials and a large throng of revelers are assembled, the drums die down, and the elder speaks:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An elderly orc, dressed in deep blue robes, stands atop a platform of crates. He smiles at the crowd. "Mighty warriors, brilliant strategists, you have impressed us with your feats of strength, your incisive wit, and your sturdy bellies," he booms proudly. "But the main event, as you know, is yet to come. Only two teams will be chosen to compete in the final challenge—a race through the Emerald Grotto, in the depths of which the greatest prize awaits!"
^07c

Elder Ushru explains that he and Elder Colbu Kaz will choose two teams from among the festival's most successful contestants and invite them to engage in a race through a submerged grotto to retrieve a jeweled icon that has symbolized the competitive spirit of Jigow for generations: the Emerald Eye. The winners of the race receive 100 gp and are hailed as the city's Champions of Merit for the next year.

Elder Colbu Kaz joins Elder Ushru on the platform, where they consult briefly, pointing at figures in the crowd and whispering to each other. They eventually decide on two teams: the player characters and the rivals. Both groups are invited to follow the elders to the Emerald Grotto to compete in the grand finale.

## The Emerald Grotto

The Black Islands sit in the mouth of the Ifolon River where it flows into the Emerald Gulch, a sea with a rocky shoreline. A cave in the smallest island offers access to the Emerald Grotto, a twisting network of underwater caves where the grand finale of the festival takes place.

### The Grand Finale Begins

The characters and the rivals proceed with the elders to the southeastern edge of Jigow with what seems like the entire population in a procession behind them. The atmosphere is one of anticipation and excitement.

The characters and their rivals follow the elders as they wade through the shallows, from one island to another. When they reach the smallest island, Elder Colbu Kaz places several [potions of water breathing](/compendium/items/potion-of-water-breathing.md) in front of the contestants—one for each of them. "Their magic lasts for one hour," he says.

Then, Elder Ushru halts the crowd and raises his arms to address all assembled:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Elder Ushru stands before the mouth of a cave and addresses you and your opponents. "You brave and valiant individuals have triumphed in many challenges this day; now, the final Test of Merit awaits you!" He pulls a palm-sized gold-and-emerald amulet from his robes, holds it aloft, and declares: "This medal's twin has been placed in the deepest cavern of the Emerald Grotto. Be the first to claim the Emerald Eye and return it to this place to be declared Jigow's Champions of Merit! Begin now!"
^07f

Have each character make a Dexterity check. If at least half the characters get a total of 13 or higher on the check, the characters enter the grotto first. Otherwise, the rivals enter first.

### Keeping Track of the Race

The progress of the characters and their rivals as they move through the grotto is measured in rounds. You'll need to keep track of the number of rounds it takes for the party to traverse the locations in the grotto, as it affects the encounter in area E10.

The number of rounds it takes to traverse a location and clear its obstacles (if any) is detailed in the "Race Progression" section of each location's description.

If the rivals enter the grotto after the characters, they choose whichever path in area E3 the characters didn't take.

### Emerald Grotto Features

The Emerald Grotto is a natural cave system. Unless otherwise noted, its features are as follows:

- **Ceilings..** Chambers are 15 feet high, and tunnels are 5 feet high.
- **Light..** Unless otherwise specified, there is no natural light.
- **Water..** Most of the Emerald Grotto is underwater (see "Underwater Adventuring" in the introduction).

### Emerald Grotto Locations

The following locations are keyed to the Emerald Grotto map.

#### E1: Grotto Entrance

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The entrance to the grotto is a narrow cavern that leads to a murky pool of water.
^084

Elder Colbu Kaz and Elder Ushru wait here for the contestants to return.

Though the narrow cavern looks like a dead end, characters who enter the pool of water, or who succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, notice that the tunnel dips below sea level. The rest of the cavern beyond this location is underwater.

##### Race Progression

It takes the characters 1 round to dive into the water and traverse this room.

#### E2: Kelp Tangle

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The light that trickles in from the grotto's entrance is blotted out by the thick patches of kelp that fill this underwater chamber. The tops of the kelp fronds brush the ceiling, but between the stalks you can spot a glimmer of light coming from farther ahead.
^087

This is the first fully submerged chamber of the grotto. The characters must make a DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) group check as they try to swim through the mass of kelp (see the "Player's Handbook" for the rules on "group checks"). The result of this check determines the time it takes them to move through the chamber.

##### Race Progression

If the group check is successful, it takes the characters 1 round to traverse the room; otherwise, it takes 2 rounds.

#### E3: Cavern Fork

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Silvery moonlight filters in through a gap in the cavern's stone ceiling. Ahead, the path through the grotto splits into two tunnels: one to the south and one to the east.
^08a

If the rival party entered the grotto first, they take the southern path at the fork (leading to areas E7, E8, and E9). Maggie Keeneyes lingers at the fork, waiting for the characters and then encouraging them to take the eastern path (leading to areas E4, E5, and E6). If the characters try to take the southern path instead, Maggie blocks their way and defends herself if attacked. If the characters take the eastern path, Maggie waits until they're gone and then follows the rest of her group.

##### Race Progression

If the characters dawdled while choosing which path to take, it takes them 2 rounds to traverse the room; otherwise, it takes them 1 round.

#### E4: Ghostgrass Patch

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls, ceiling, and floor of this chamber are covered in bioluminescent algae, which emits a faint bluish glow that dimly lights the wide cavern. Two large, jagged stone pillars, also coated with algae, stand at opposite ends of the chamber. Surrounding the far pillar, in front of the exit from this cavern, is a thick patch of bone-white sea grass.
^08d

The pale plants blocking the exit to the cavern are ghostgrass, a carnivorous variety of sea grass. A creature that tries to swim past the ghostgrass must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and be [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained). A [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns until it escapes.

A creature can use an action to try to free itself or another creature within its reach from the ghostgrass, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A character freed from the ghostgrass emerges on the other side of the patch at the cavern's exit.

##### Algae

A character can harvest some of the algae from the cavern walls with a successful DC 11 Intelligence ([Nature](/rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. A harvested patch of algae can be used as a portable light source, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius. Algae removed from the water dies and ceases to glow after 1 hour.

##### Race Progression

It takes at least 2 rounds to traverse this chamber, plus the number of rounds it takes for characters who are caught in the ghostgrass to get free. If any characters stopped to harvest algae, add 1 round to the total.

#### E5: Landslide

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The tunnel opens into a cavernous space. Rays of moonlight shine through a wide crack in the ceiling, which sits ten feet above the water level. One side of the chamber is covered in the crumbled and muddy remains of a landslide.
> 
> As you swim into this area, ripples course through the water as more rocky debris begins to slide toward you.
^091

Each character must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage from the landslide on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The landslides that plague this chamber have partially blocked the exit. To find the way out, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If everyone making this check fails, the character who rolled the highest eventually locates the exit, but it takes more time. A character who succeeds on this check by 5 or more also spots a hidden cave at the top of the landslide.

##### Hidden Cave

A character who explores this cave discovers a vial containing a [potion of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md) and a soggy but usable spell scroll of [thunderwave](/compendium/spells/thunderwave.md).

##### Race Progression

It takes at least 2 rounds to traverse the room. If no character succeeded on the check to locate the exit, add 2 rounds to the total. If a character stopped to search the hidden cave, add 1 round to the total.

#### E6: Quipper Den

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A school of tiny fish, their bodies shimmering in the dim light, swirls in formation like an undulating silvery pillar.
^095

A [swarm of quippers](/compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-quippers.md) swims in the middle of this cave. The swarm attacks characters who move within 10 feet of it or deal damage to it. The swarm pursues the characters into area E10 or back into E5 if it isn't killed.

##### Race Progression

It takes at least 1 round to traverse this chamber. Keep track of how many rounds of combat the party spends fighting the swarm, and add that number of rounds to the total.

#### E7: Octopus's Garden

> [!quote] ...
> 
> After swimming through a small patch of sea grass, you emerge into a long cavern. The water here doesn't quite reach the ceiling, leaving a small pocket of air near the top. A slight crack in the ceiling allows moonlight to filter through. At the center of the cavern is a pit whose floor is thirty feet deeper than the rest of the cavern—and you catch the faint glint of metal at the bottom.
^098

A [giant octopus](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-octopus.md) dwells at the bottom of the pit and attacks anyone who enters it. A character who enters the pit and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the octopus at the bottom and is not surprised when it attacks. If reduced to 13 hit points or fewer, it uses Ink Cloud and moves 10 feet away, hoping the characters leave it alone.

##### Treasure

Once the octopus is defeated, a character who searches the bottom of the pit finds 57 sp and a pouch containing [dust of dryness](/compendium/items/dust-of-dryness.md) in the form of eight marble-sized pellets that have absorbed hundreds of gallons of water. When a pellet is smashed, the act releases a 15-foot cube of water.

##### Race Progression

It takes at least 1 round to traverse this chamber. Keep track of how many rounds the party spends fighting the octopus and add that number to the total. If one or more characters take the time to search the pit, add 1 round to the total.

#### E8: Riptide Tunnel

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This tunnel rises at a steep incline and contains a strong, opposing current. A heavy stone tablet covered in glyphs and wreathed in sea grass rests on the tunnel floor.
^09c

The tunnel is 30 feet long, and the current rushing through it makes swimming northward difficult. A character who wants to swim against the current must make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a failed check, the character makes no progress on their turn.

##### Tablet

A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals that the tablet radiates an aura of evocation magic. The tablet has AC 15, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying the tablet causes the current to subside, allowing creatures to travel through the tunnel without resistance.

##### Race Progression

Count the number of rounds it takes for the characters to reach area E9 by swimming against the current. If the characters destroy the tablet, they can swim the tunnel's length in 2 rounds.

#### E9: Dead End?

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The tunnel opens into a smooth-walled cavern that appears to be a dead end.
^0a0

An exit tunnel is hidden behind some rocks on the east side of the chamber. A character can locate the exit in one of two ways:

- A character can spend 1 round search||searching the east wall, then succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.
- A character can spend 1 round feeling the currents, finding the exit with a successful DC 11 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check.

If no character succeeds on either check, the character who rolled highest eventually locates the exit, but it takes more time. A character who succeeds on either check by 5 or more also notices a cave concealed behind the kelp on the south side of the chamber.

##### Concealed Cave

A character who searches this cave finds three [potions of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md), likely stashed here by a hopeful contestant planning to gain an advantage in this race.

##### Race Progression

It takes at least 1 round to traverse the room and 1 round to find the eastern exit (or 2 rounds if no character succeeded on a check to locate the exit). If a character stopped to search the concealed cave, add 1 round to the total.

#### E10: Moonshark Lair

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Silvery light dances along the walls of this underwater cave. The water here is a little warmer, and a gentle current pulls you toward a crevice in the south wall that emits shimmering golden light. Prowling around the cave's pillars is a massive shark. A gold amulet hangs from a thick rope tied around the shark's body, and a silver spear protrudes from its side.
^0a4

The amulet is the Emerald Eye—the goal of this race. The silver spear lodged in the shark's hide has been enchanted by the divine power of Sehanine the Moon Weaver. The shark uses the [giant shark](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-shark.md) stat block. A character within 5 feet of the shark can use an action to try to dislodge the spear, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. While the spear is lodged in the [shark](/compendium/bestiary/beast/moonshark-crcotn.md), apply these changes to the shark's stat block:

- The shark glows with silvery illumination, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
- If the shark uses its action to make a Bite attack but misses, it can use a bonus action to swim up to 25 feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attack||opportunity attacks.

The shark immediately attacks any creature that enters its chamber. Depending on how quickly the characters moved through the grotto, the encounter could go one of three ways:

- **Fast Pace (10 or Fewer Rounds)..** The characters outpaced the rivals. The rivals don't appear until after the encounter with the shark is resolved.
- **Moderate Pace (Between 11 and 15 Rounds)..** The characters beat the rivals to the chamber, but not by much. The rivals enter the chamber on the third round of combat and roll initiative. Unless the rivals are hostile toward the characters, they aid the characters in the fight against the shark; otherwise, they focus on acquiring the amulet or try to sabotage the characters (though these attempts are never intentionally lethal).
- **Slow Pace (16 or More Rounds)..** The rivals get to the chamber ahead of the characters. When the characters arrive, the rivals have reduced the shark to 75 hit points. The characters roll initiative when they enter the chamber.

##### Emerald Eye

A druid of Jigow cast [animal friendship](/compendium/spells/animal-friendship.md) on the shark earlier today and tied the Emerald Eye around its body, then made a speedy getaway. A character can cut the amulet free by attacking the rope around the shark instead of the shark itself. The rope has AC 17 and 5 hit points. It can be removed as an action if the shark is killed or [incapacitated](/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). The amulet, which is made of gold and emeralds, is worth 500 gp—though no one in Jigow will buy it, since it must be returned the town elders once the contest is completed.

##### Moonshark's Defeat

When the shark is reduced to 0 hit points, it thrashes about in its death throes and crashes into the stone pillar in the south part of the room, which tumbles into the south wall and cracks it open. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The dying shark slams into the stone pillar in the south end of the cavern. The pillar cracks under the force, teeters, then crashes down against the south wall. The wall fractures and collapses, revealing a passage awash with golden light.
^0a7

The newly opened passage (area E11) leads to a hidden chamber (area E12).

#### E11: Moon Weaver's Gateway

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The cramped passage bends upward until the tunnel becomes vertical. Golden light radiates from the upper end of the shaft.
^0a9

Characters who swim through this passage break the surface of the water and emerge in a glowing, air-filled chamber (area E12).

#### E12: Prayer Site of Sehanine

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The watery environment gives way to a cavern dotted with trees and pools of water. The walls are covered in vines of green ivy interspersed with colorful flowers. Part of the cavern is open to the sky.
> 
> In the middle of the cavern is a sphere of pale light surrounding a crystal pedestal, upon which rests a golden pendant attached to a fine golden chain.
^0ab

The object on the crystal pedestal glitters like the sunrise. This is the Jewel of Three Prayers, a Vestige of Divergence that will drive the course of the adventure from now on. The [Jewel of Three Prayers](/compendium/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-dormant-crcotn.md) is currently in its Dormant State (see appendix B for the description of this magic item).

If the rivals are present, they are hesitant to touch the jewel, giving the characters the first opportunity to do so. If the characters are also hesitant, Ayo Jabe steels herself and strides forward to claim it (see "Disputing Destiny" below). Otherwise, as soon as one of the characters touches the jewel, the entire party experiences the following vision:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The light around the pedestal fades as a spectral figure in the form of a male human rises from the amulet. He is dressed in leather armor and a tattered red cape and wears a shield. His face is framed by curly brown hair and bears a melancholic expression. He pleads, "I am imprisoned. Please help me."
> 
> Suddenly, the ground vanishes beneath your feet, and you fall, tumbling through a vortex of golden light. You fall deeper, deeper, deeper, then suddenly stop. The golden light subsides, and you find yourself suspended in a pitch-black expanse. You feel water buoying you. A vermilion light appears in the distance, illuminating the melancholy warrior, who is shackled to the ground by disgusting strands of a fleshy, crimson substance.
> 
> He raises his gaze to the heavens and, sobbing, chokes out, "Moon Weaver, I beg of you. Guide those with the power to save me to the site where first I prayed to you." He looks around, and his eyes settle on you. "Oh, gods, there you are! My name is Alyxian. I am lost in darkness. Long ago, I prayed to the Change Bringer in the heart of a temple of evil. I beg you, take my jewel and..."
> 
> You feel consciousness leaving you, as if the pressure of the water were crushing the life out of you. Alyxian's voice is the last thing you hear before you pass out. "Save me. Please."
^0ac

If the rivals are present, they can hear the distorted, disembodied voice of Alyxian as if he were speaking underwater. When the vision ends, the characters fall [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute.

What happens next depends on the characters' relationship with the rivals:

- **Friendly or Indifferent Rivals..** The characters awaken to find the rivals attempting to rouse them. Though they didn't see the vision, the rivals sensed a surge of energy erupting from the jewel, then found the characters [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) in the cavern. If the characters retrieved the Emerald Eye, the rivals concede the competition to them. Otherwise, the rivals proudly hold up the amulet, claiming it as theirs, but congratulate the characters on a race well run.
- **Hostile Rivals..** The characters awaken to discover that the rivals have absconded with both the Emerald Eye and the Jewel of Three Prayers.

##### Disputing Destiny

If Ayo or another one of the rivals touched the Jewel of Three Prayers, they are the recipients of the vision instead. The rivals fall [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute, and it is up to the characters to decide what to do with them. In this scenario, which is examined further in chapter 2, the rivals are the "heroes" of the story, and the characters must decide if they want to aid their rivals or take back the jewel and claim their own heroic destiny.

## Next Steps

Whether or not the characters retrieved the Emerald Eye, they can backtrack through the Emerald Grotto and avoid any potential combat. They can also take the time to investigate places that they didn't check out on the way in.

### Characters Triumphant

If the characters present the Emerald Eye to Elder Ushru, he declares them the winners of this year's Festival of Merit. The ecstatic crowd surrounds the characters and offers congratulations.

As the folks of Jigow begin to settle down and turn in for the night, Elder Ushru asks the characters to hand over the Emerald Eye, in exchange for the 100 gp reward and an invitation to stay the night at the Unbroken Tusk inn free of charge.

### Rivals Triumphant

If the rivals present the Emerald Eye to Elder Ushru, he declares them the champions of this year's Festival of Merit, and the crowd acknowledges them with adulation.

While the townsfolk crowd around the rivals, Elder Ushru approaches the characters. Though they lost the race, the elder assures them that he chose their group to compete for a reason—that true merit is something proven not in a single day but rather over the course of an individual's life, one small act at a time. As a consolation prize, he offers them rooms at the Unbroken Tusk inn for the night, free of charge.

### What of the Jewel?

Unless the characters take steps to conceal the Jewel of Three Prayers, Elder Ushru takes notice of the item. Even if they do keep it from his view, Ushru senses a change in the characters' demeanor—something happened to them in the grotto, something no one in Jigow could have expected. This suspicion prompts him to speak to the characters in the morning—leading into the events of chapter 2.
