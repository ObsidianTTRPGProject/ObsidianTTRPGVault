# Chapter 3: Bazzoxan
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep* 

An immense temple of dusky stone called the Betrayers' Rise casts a foreboding shadow over the town of Bazzoxan. The next leg of the adventure sends the characters deep into this ancient stronghold of evil. There, they learn more about Alyxian's past and where he's now imprisoned, thereby awakening new power within the Jewel of Three Prayers.

Bazzoxan is a military outpost locked in a stalemate while trying to protect the rest of the Kryn Dynasty from the demons that surge from the depths of the Betrayers' Rise. Just as the characters enter the town, they find themselves facing an incursion. After the attack, they're welcomed to Bazzoxan by the drow commander of the town's defenders, Taskhand [Verin Thelyss](/compendium/bestiary/npc/verin-thelyss-crcotn.md).

The characters can interact with the locals and investigate the town, where they meet agents of three factions from the distant continent of Marquet. The characters might ally with one of these faction agents, who all want to control the power hidden within the Betrayers' Rise—and the characters' rivals might do the same. The characters' journey through the temple eventually brings them to the place where Alyxian asked the god Avandra for her aid during the Calamity.

At this prayer site, the characters receive another vision, unlock new properties of the Jewel of Three Prayers, and come face to face with their rivals once again. The outcome of this confrontation not only determines who possesses the jewel but also defines the tangled web of relationships between the characters, their rivals, and the Marquesian factions—just before the characters are swept up in a spell that transports them to Marquet.

## Running This Chapter

The first part of this chapter is an exploration sequence in which the characters interact with locals and visit locations in Bazzoxan to learn more about their vision in the Emerald Grotto and the Jewel of Three Prayers. This section and the dungeon exploration that follows are intentionally open-ended and designed to reward inquisitive characters.

Because the characters can go anywhere in town, it's important for you to read both the "Bazzoxan Overview" and "Locations in Bazzoxan" sections to familiarize yourself with the town before running this chapter.

If the characters get stuck or frustrated, you can use friendly nonplayer characters such as [Verin Thelyss](/compendium/bestiary/npc/verin-thelyss-crcotn.md) and the faction agents to give them hints about how they could learn more. Ultimately, the characters need to find the prayer site inside the Betrayers' Rise.

Starting in this chapter, the characters' rivals use their tier 2 stat blocks (see appendix A).

### Who Has the Jewel?

The path to the prayer site can be opened only by using the Jewel of Three Prayers. Doing so allows access to a segment of the Betrayers' Rise that has never been explored by the Aurora Watch. If the characters don't have the jewel, they might need to take it from the rivals—by stealth, by force, or by barter—as described in area B7, later in the chapter.

In addition, the final confrontation in this chapter is a duel for the possession of the jewel. Regardless of whether the rivals or the characters end up with the jewel, the adventure continues on the far-off continent of Marquet. The "Next Steps" section of the chapter explains how to transition the characters from Bazzoxan to their new location.

## No Time for Pleasantries

This chapter begins as two Aurora Watch [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) guide the characters from the gate of Bazzoxan toward the Gatehold Barracks. Read or paraphrase the following as the characters enter the town:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> From around the corner of a crumbling building, five twitching, skinless masses of blinking eyes and slavering mouths wriggle into view. One of them is shredding the flesh of a hapless soldier in three of its amorphous maws. Trumpets blare an alarm, and several Aurora Watch soldiers hurry into the streets. One of them, a male drow, pauses to address you. "Newcomers? No time for pleasantries—draw your weapons or get to safety! Find me at the barracks after!"
^0e4

Five [gibbering mouthers](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) have sneaked into Bazzoxan and are intent on consuming anyone in their path. Opposing them are members of the Aurora Watch led by Taskhand [Verin Thelyss](/compendium/bestiary/npc/verin-thelyss-crcotn.md) (see the accompanying stat block).

To the people of Bazzoxan, Verin is a beacon of hope amid the darkness that shrouds the town. But the weight of responsibility colors Verin's otherwise bright and youthful demeanor with melancholy. He cares about the town he has sworn to protect, but he is weary of the incessant threat posed by the denizens of the Betrayers' Rise.

The alarms sounding from watchtowers across the town indicate that similar attacks are happening in other areas. Civilians head for secure buildings while members of the Aurora Watch mobilize to engage the threat. Characters can tell from everyone's drawn faces and practiced movements that attacks like this occur often. The characters can either get involved in the fight or run for safety.

### Fight!

If the characters choose to help the Aurora Watch, everyone rolls initiative. [Verin](/compendium/bestiary/npc/verin-thelyss-crcotn.md) and two orc [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) of the Aurora Watch stay with the party, while the rest of the soldiers leave to secure other parts of the city.

#### Rivals

If the rivals are accompanying the characters when they enter Bazzoxan, Verin directs the rivals to assist in defense of the infirmary (area B3). They're momentarily indignant at being ordered around, but they fall in line when Ayo echoes the command.

### Flight!

If the characters flee, they must find a safe building in which to hide. It quickly becomes clear that most such places have already been barricaded shut by the residents holed up inside them. A character who wants to get into one of these safe houses must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to convince its occupants to open the door. Alternatively, a character can make a DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to scan the area, finding an available safe house on a success. A character can make either check once per minute. Every time a character gets a failure on one of these checks, a [gibbering mouther](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) emerges from hiding and attacks that character.

#### Rivals

If the rivals are with the characters when they enter Bazzoxan, Verin orders the rivals to stay and fight while the characters flee. Ayo Jabe doesn't like taking orders, but she falls in line—as do her companions.

### Aftermath

The alarms stop after 5 minutes, signaling that the danger has been quelled. The uneasy calm of daily life in Bazzoxan resumes. The monsters that attacked other parts of town have been handled by Aurora Watch soldiers.

After the gibbering mouthers have been defeated, Aurora Watch soldiers begin carrying the wounded to the infirmary (area B3). One way or another, the rivals end up in the infirmary after the battle, and their condition depends on the actions of the characters:

- If the characters fought alongside Verin, the rivals are safe at the infirmary and eager for news.
- If the characters fled with the civilians, leaving the rivals to fight alongside Verin, Ayo Jabe was gravely wounded in the battle. Maggie Keeneyes carried Ayo to the infirmary, where she is treated by Dermot Wurder. Irvan and Galsariad linger outside the infirmary, concerned about their group's future.

#### Chatting with Verin

If the characters are with Verin when the battle ends, he formally introduces himself as the leader of Bazzoxan and apologizes that their arrival was complicated by the gibbering mouther attack. He answers general questions about Bazzoxan (anything found in the "Bazzoxan Overview" section below) but soon excuses himself to check on the rest of the town. He leaves the characters to explore Bazzoxan at their leisure and invites them to meet with him later at the Gatehold Barracks (area B4).

## Bazzoxan Overview

Bazzoxan hums with activity. People are cleaning up debris from the last attack, tending to the injured, performing last rites for the dead, repairing fortifications, and preparing for the next incursion. Gibbering mouthers—created by demons in the Betrayers' Rise—are common threats, as are dretches, quasits, and other lesser demons. On rare occasions, more powerful demons attack, or demonic energy animates the bodies of dead Aurora Watch soldiers.

Most of the town's inhabitants are soldiers who understand that their role here is not to defeat the horrors in the Betrayers' Rise, but to keep them in check for as long as possible. The town's civilian residents go about their lives as normally as they can, and few complain about their situation.

Details about locations in the town can be found in the "Locations in Bazzoxan" section later in the chapter.

### Geography

Bazzoxan is built into the base of a rust-red mountain range north of the valley known as the Barbed Fields. The craggy, rocky landscape is mostly devoid of plant life, except for a few scraggly pines and patches of scrub.

Bazzoxan was once a thriving mining town, but it was ravaged when explorers awakened a portal to the Abyss in the depths of the Betrayers' Rise. Many of the town's buildings were destroyed when the first surge of demons attacked, and the town was hastily converted into a military outpost to hold the demons at bay. The only structures regularly tended to are the Aurora Watch barracks, most of which are buildings converted from their original purpose.

#### Sacrifice Engines

Among the most prominent features of Bazzoxan are the town's two sacrifice engines, each one a 30-foot-deep pit lined with rows of silver blades. The blades can be made to spin by pulling a lever near the edge of the pit. A creature in the pit while the blades are spinning takes 44 (8d10) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns.

In bygone days, servants of the Betrayer Gods threw mortals into these pits to appease their evil lords. Now, the Aurora Watch herds demons and other monsters into them to avoid prolonged battles.

### Populace

The majority of Bazzoxan's inhabitants are members of the Aurora Watch. Also residing here are a handful of Kryn Dynasty arcanists attempting to find and seal the planar rifts that threaten the city. Dealing with these phenomena is far beyond the characters' abilities at present, and in any event they can't afford to linger in Bazzoxan, lest their rivals find the prayer site of Avandra before them. Nonetheless, this chapter provides an opportunity for you to foreshadow the devastation that the rift to the Netherdeep can cause for Ank'Harel later in the adventure.

The few civilians who remain in Bazzoxan support the soldiers as well as they can and are trained in the basics of combat in case the forces from the Betrayers' Rise begin to overwhelm the military. Most residents are drow, but some goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, orcs, and other Xhorhasian folk live here as well.

Most residents of Bazzoxan avoid conversation, citing the need to tend to their duties if they are approached. The Bazzoxan Scenes table provides suggestions for small engagements the characters can experience while exploring the town.

### Rivals in Bazzoxan

After the encounter with the gibbering mouthers, the rivals lose some of their bluster. Though they try to keep up appearances, they are severely shaken by the experience. Galsariad is the most deeply affected, his already sarcastic demeanor becoming close to insulting toward friend and foe alike as his insecurities threaten to rise to the surface. Irvan becomes withdrawn, overwhelmed by the oppressive atmosphere in Bazzoxan and the morbid humor of the locals. Dermot throws himself fervently into following the Luxon's precepts, determined to do whatever it takes to protect his friends and rarely leaving Ayo's side. If he is persuaded to take a moment away from the group, he talks openly about his concerns. He recognizes that his friends have been traumatized and would like them to go home rather than continuing. No matter what, he intends to support them to the end.

If Ayo was injured in the encounter as a result of the characters' decision to run and hide, the rivals are hostile toward whomever they see as the characters' leader, and Maggie Keeneyes is hostile toward the entire party because of their cowardice. Ayo is shaken by the injuries, causing her to question her skill as a leader, but she bears no ill will toward the characters for putting their safety first.

### Locations in Bazzoxan

The following locations are keyed to the map of Bazzoxan.

#### B1: Gate of Bazzoxan

The entrance to Bazzoxan is a wide gate that is opened or closed from atop its battlements by operating a series of wheels, chains, and pulleys.

#### B2: Crematorium

The crematorium is a simple stone building built against the mountainside.

When the characters approach the building, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Thick, acrid smoke billows from the chimneys of this stone building. Corpses wrapped in beige cloth are stacked in a small yard northeast of the building.
> 
> A willowy man wearing a leather apron greets you at the entrance with surprising cheer. "New bodies for Bazzoxan, I see!" Behind him stands a giant of a man: muscular, blue-eyed, with short-cropped hair and a missing arm.
^0f5

The two men are Reynard Allerton, a chaotic good [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), and his bigger, older brother, Sebastian Allerton, a neutral good [thug](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md). Their crematorium has two furnaces, each of which can hold up to four Medium bodies or one Large body at a time. The brothers are responsible for the proper disposal of corpses. Reynard seems to be the more gregarious of the siblings, although if the characters can coax Sebastian out of his silence with a joke or a kind remark, the older brother is also revealed to be a good-natured chatterbox.

When the characters arrive, the brothers are burning the latest batch of corpses. Reynard promptly asks the characters to help him and his brother with their task.

##### Corpse Disposal

As the brothers (and any characters who decide to assist them) work through the stack of corpses, Reynard becomes increasingly reluctant to continue, asking the characters to tend to the bodies and making excuses for why he should tend the fire. A character who succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check can tell that he's deliberately avoiding one of the large corpses near the bottom of the pile, out of disdain and horror.

Characters who are helping with the pile of bodies find the source of Reynard's disgust: a dead vrock whose body reeks of offal and blood. Reynard has been putting off the task of burning it because he finds the demon repulsive and because the corpse hasn't dissolved into a pool of demonic ichor as it should have, which suggests some sort of abnormality.

Before anyone can dispose of the vrock's remains, a commotion arises nearby:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Wait! Stop!" a voice shouts from down the street. A bookish tiefling jogs into view. A variety of archaeology tools hang at his waist along with a satchel holding his notebooks. "You can't burn that yet. I need to study it!" Reaching into the satchel, he pulls out a badge and holds it up, as if the badge alone explained his reason for being here.
^0f7

The tiefling is [Prolix Yusaf](/compendium/bestiary/npc/prolix-yusaf-crcotn.md), a lawful neutral [scholarly agent](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-agent-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) from the Allegiance of Allsight. His badge displays the symbol of his faction: a scroll bearing a single, watchful eye.

Prolix introduces himself as an archaeologist from Ank'Harel, a city on the distant continent of Marquet. He nervously explains that because vrocks often swallow jewelry and other ornamental objects, he has reason to believe that the vrock might have a few valuable items from the Betrayers' Rise in its stomach—and he'd like to try to cut them out before the Allertons burn the corpse.

Lacking experience with dead bodies, Prolix turns to the characters for assistance. A character who wants to extract the contents of the vrock's stomach must first cleave through the vrock's hide. To do so, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. A failed check triggers an eruption of spores from the vrock's corpse that fill a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the corpse. All creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). A creature [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

##### Treasure

The vrock's gullet contains a pair of gold-trimmed [eyes of the eagle](/compendium/items/eyes-of-the-eagle.md), three gaudy rings worth 2 gp each, and a cube-shaped puzzle box made of onyx and measuring 3 inches on a side. A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the box, which is locked. Prolix grabs it before anyone else can do so, leaving the other items for the characters. As soon as the puzzle box is removed from the dead vrock's gullet, the enchantment on the vrock fades, and it begins to dissolve into a puddle of reeking ichor.

Anyone who tinkers with the puzzle box's locking mechanism for 1 minute can make a DC 20 Intelligence check, opening the box on a success. The box contains a folded-up spell scroll of [bestow curse](/compendium/spells/bestow-curse.md).

##### Roleplaying Prolix

Once he has obtained the puzzle box, Prolix's demeanor turns from friendly to reserved. He claims that he knows how to unlock the puzzle box but insists on doing so in an isolated location to prevent the "danger" contained within from hurting anyone. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check can determine that Prolix is lying and trying to sound important.

A character who presses Prolix for answers can make a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If the check succeeds, Prolix gives one of the following answers; if the check succeeds by 5 or more, he becomes friendly toward the characters and shares everything he knows freely:

##### Why are you here

"I'm an archaeologist, but I'm not here to perform archaeology, per se. I was sent by the Allegiance of Allsight to spy on a rival agent of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream." Prolix says that the Allegiance doesn't know why the Consortium dispatched someone to Bazzoxan, but the reason can't be good.

##### Who is your rival

"Aloysia. That's her name. She's looking for something in the Betrayers' Rise. She's not hard to spot. Tall, pale, dressed in red. Cold-blooded. Seems like she'd do anything to get what she wants. And what she wants is... well, that's what I'd like to know!" Prolix goes on to say that both he and Aloysia are staying at the Ready Room (area R7).

##### Do you know how to open the puzzle box or not

"Of course not! But it came from inside the temple—it must hold something important." Prolix intends to keep the box and its contents from falling into Aloysia's hands.

If the characters let Prolix keep the puzzle box, he offers them a deal: if they find out what Aloysia is up to and stop her, he will give them 200 gp, as well as the box and whatever might be inside it.

##### Prolix and the Jewel

If the characters have the Jewel of Three Prayers and show it to Prolix, he says he doesn't know what the jewel represents, although he recognizes it as something both powerful and ancient. If the characters give him the opportunity, he draws a quick sketch of the item, jots down some notes, and invites the characters to return with him to the Crystal Chateau, his university in Ank'Harel, once their respective missions in Bazzoxan are complete. He suggests the university's libraries might have more information about the jewel's purpose.

If the characters seem eager to learn more about the jewel, Prolix mentions meeting a "real smartie" who is also staying at the Ready Room (area B7). This other scholar is a tiefling named Question, who Prolix believes is visiting Bazzoxan for research as well. Prolix relates having an animated discussion with Question the other night about key historical figures of the Calamity.

#### B3: Infirmary

Three buildings on the perimeter of the central square have doors marked with a symbol of a hand alight with magic, identifying them as places of healing. When the characters enter one of the buildings, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls are lined with shelves that hold old books and medical supplies. The floor is crammed with narrow cots. There's a small office in the back, its door ajar, and the air reeks of medicinal poultices.
^0ff

Inside, the characters find a lawful neutral, drow [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) chatting with a young female drow, whose Aurora Watch armor and satchel are stacked nearby. Other wounded patients—most of them asleep—fill the infirmary beds.

When she sees the characters, the priest leaves her patient's side to greet them, introducing herself as Bautha Dyrr. She then asks them about their health. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check identifies a pin in the shape of a black wing attached to Bautha's cloak as the holy symbol of Xalicas, a legendary solar who served as the right hand of Corellon the Arch Heart before falling in the Calamity. As a follower of Xalicas, Bautha disapproves of the reclamation efforts in Bazzoxan; though she supports the effort to hold back the forces of the Abyss, she believes the Kryn Dynasty's military presence here is creating needless casualties with little to show for it. Nevertheless, Bautha strives to heal and protect those in Bazzoxan, and she casts [cure wounds](/compendium/spells/cure-wounds.md) or [lesser restoration](/compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) on victims for free, as long as she has spell slots to spare.

Bautha also has a spell scroll of [greater restoration](/compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md). She must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom check to cast the spell from the scroll; otherwise, the scroll is destroyed with no effect. She will sell it to the characters for 500 gp.

Bautha is familiar with [Prolix Yusaf](/compendium/bestiary/npc/prolix-yusaf-crcotn.md) and [Aloysia Telfan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aloysia-telfan-crcotn.md), since both individuals have visited the infirmary for care in the past week. She sees them as reckless and naive, and she thinks that their obsession with researching the Betrayers' Rise can lead to no good end. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check gets her to reveal that Aloysia was injured when she tried to delve into the Betrayers' Rise alone—and now she's looking for mercenaries to explore it on her behalf.

##### Bautha and the Jewel

If the characters show Bautha the Jewel of Three Prayers, identify it by name, and ask her about it, she doesn't recognize it, but something about the name reminds her of an old tale. She thinks for a moment, then says:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Three prayers... Oh! You know, it must be that old story about the champion of three gods. Goodness gracious, I can't believe I remembered it. It's a fragment of a fragment of a legend, even in temples in Vasselheim and Ank'Harel." She clears her throat. "Long ago, a hero of the Calamity begged for aid from three different gods in his time of need. Avandra the Change Bringer was one of them, and I think Sehanine the Moon Weaver was another. And, uh, I'm afraid I don't remember anything else."
^101

As the characters prepare to leave the infirmary, Bautha suddenly recalls one other detail:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "This might be a fiction, but Avandra is said to have grieved for the hero—not because he had died, but because she feared her aid forced him to give up so much of himself that he would be robbed of a future."
^102

##### Naevyn's Request

As the characters make their way to the exit, the wounded member of the Aurora Watch calls for the characters to approach her cot. Her body is covered with wounds she received in the gibbering mouther attack.

The drow is Naevyn Tasithar, a neutral good [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md). She weakly salutes the characters, then asks them to hand her her satchel. She pulls out a small tiger's eye carving of a rabbit with her name carved into the bottom. Naevyn explains that she was planning to visit the Wall of the Unforgotten (area B6) and place this trinket there. If asked why, she looks away and refuses to answer, but asks the characters to place it by the wall. Characters who speak to Kalym, a priest stationed at the wall, can learn Naevyn's reason.

#### B4: Gatehold Barracks

The Aurora Watch's command center is located in the Gatehold Barracks. The complex contains lodgings for Taskhand [Verin Thelyss](/compendium/bestiary/npc/verin-thelyss-crcotn.md) and his senior officers, as well as accommodations for regular soldiers. Like most of Bazzoxan's buildings, these are in a constant state of reconstruction; splintered boards and broken shingles are salvaged to be sorted and repurposed, and canvas is tacked up on walls to cover holes that have yet to be repaired.

When the characters enter this area for the first time, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> These barracks are filled with the sounds of chatter, voices shouting orders, and clanging metal. Armored Aurora Watch soldiers go about their business, performing drills and sharpening weapons.
^105

The barracks are divided into four main sections: the war room, the mess hall, the training area, and the sleeping quarters. If Taskhand [Verin Thelyss](/compendium/bestiary/npc/verin-thelyss-crcotn.md) is expecting the characters, a soldier is waiting for them and leads them to the war room.

##### War Room

The war room is a small, sparsely furnished office Verin uses to discuss battle strategy and political concerns with his officers. A circular table in the center of the room is covered with maps of Bazzoxan; updated barricade designs; and notes regarding various horrid creatures, their redoubts, and the rifts they spawn from.

Verin greets the characters with warmth and gentle concern. After the initial pleasantries, he politely asks the characters to state their intended business in Bazzoxan.

As the conversation unfolds, Verin shares the following information:

- An expedition from the Library of the Cobalt Soul is currently in the Betrayers' Rise with an Aurora Watch escort, researching battles of the Calamity that took place within its halls.
- An agent of a foreign organization calling itself the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is staying in Bazzoxan. This agent, an elf named Aloysia, has been reprimanded for trying to bribe Aurora Watch soldiers to protect her while she searches for an ancient holy site she claims is within the Betrayers' Rise.
- An archaeologist named Prolix from the Allegiance of Allsight in Ank'Harel also recently arrived in Bazzoxan. He is ostensibly assisting Aurora Watch arcanists who are researching ways to seal the rift within the Betrayers' Rise. Verin suspects that the archaeologist has other motives, because he was seen earlier in the day lurking around the crematorium (area B2).

If the characters ask Verin to share his thoughts regarding Bazzoxan's connection to the Calamity, he dissembles. A character who presses Verin for more information can make a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If the check succeeds, Verin admits he believes the Betrayers' Rise might hold the solution to breaking the stalemate that grips the town, and he has sent out scouting parties and arcane experts to confirm that idea. None of the expeditions have been fruitful so far, and Verin can't spare any more personnel to expand the effort.

If the characters tell Verin that they intend to journey to the Betrayers' Rise, he asks them to proceed with caution—and to retreat if they think they're getting in over their heads, since he can't afford to send soldiers to help them. He explains:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "The Betrayers' Rise is... challenging to navigate. Its passages shift to confuse mapmakers and search parties. I think the power of the Abyss flows through it, warping the environment so no two groups follow the same path through it. Whether it's demon magic or not doesn't really matter; all I know is that if you get lost down there, my soldiers won't be able to find you."
^107

##### Mess Hall

The mess hall, on the west side of the area, is filled with tables and plain wooden chairs. Though it's meant to be for soldiers, food here is doled out to anyone who asks. The repast consists of gruel, plain vegetables, bread, tough meat, and smoked fish.

The soldiers gathered here are relaxing and sharing gossip about recent events in the town. Characters who loiter in the mess hall overhear the following pieces of information, which they can also learn by engaging any of the soldiers in conversation:

- One member of the Cobalt Soul expedition, a tiefling named Question, went with his group up to the gate of the Betrayers' Rise but elected not to enter the place. He's holed up at the Ready Room (area B7), ready to talk about his research with anyone who will listen.
- An elf named Aloysia tried to bribe some soldiers into escorting her into the Betrayers' Rise. Some people believe that she wants only to ransack the temple, but others think her concern is religious and she is searching for long-lost lore about the Prime Deities.

##### Training Area

One of the buildings in the center of the barracks is used as a training area, where new soldiers learn their trade under the watch of officers. The characters can engage with the soldiers in three ways:

- **Shooting Match..** If a character carries a ranged weapon, a grizzled orc [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) challenges that character to a friendly shooting match. The match consists of 3 rounds, during each of which a participant makes one attack with the ranged weapon of their choice at a target 40 feet away. The target has a bullseye surrounded by three concentric rings, each one corresponding to a point value. A hit inside the outer ring (AC 14) is worth 1 point, a hit inside the middle ring (AC 16) is worth 3 points, and a hit inside the inner ring (AC 18) is worth 5 points. A critical hit scores a bullseye, which is worth 10 points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the 3 rounds is the victor (ties are possible).
- **Sparring Match..** A character can challenge an Aurora Watch soldier, or vice versa, to a sparring match with training weapons. This match can be run as a combat encounter, using the [veteran](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) stat block for the character's opponent. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a training weapon falls [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) and is stable. The match ends when one participant falls [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) or concedes defeat.
- **Wrestling Match..** A character can challenge an Aurora Watch soldier, or vice versa, to a wrestling match. Have a character make three DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) checks in a row (character's choice of which skill to use). If at least two of these checks succeed, the character's opponent taps out; otherwise, the character loses the match.

##### Sleeping Quarters

The sleeping quarters in the Gatehold Barracks contain small armories where the soldiers can store their weapons and equipment when they're off duty.

The characters aren't permitted in this location, and there is no treasure to be found here.

#### B5: Dilapidated Temple

What was once a flourishing, spiral-shaped temple has fallen into disrepair after those who tended to it were driven away or slain by demons. It has been transformed into an indoor farming plot to grow Xhorhasian vegetables that don't require sunlight.

When the characters enter the area, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Glass crunches underfoot amid overgrown weeds. Collapsed walls have been replaced with rows of wooden shelves that hold earthenware pots. Numerous alcoves are being used as planters for stubborn flora. Just outside the far end of the enclosure, a smashed mosaic of stained glass sits in a splintered window frame next to a withered, skeletal tree.
^10c

A character who makes a successful DC 17 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check can piece together that the mosaic once depicted a woman's face on a golden disk: the iconography of Avandra the Change Bringer.

##### Foghome the Gardener

A neutral good, firbolg [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) named Foghome moves through the temple at all hours of the day. For more information on firbolgs, see the accompanying "Firbolgs of Exandria" sidebar.

Foghome is here as a guest of Taskhand [Verin Thelyss](/compendium/bestiary/npc/verin-thelyss-crcotn.md) because he has offered to help the Aurora Watch create its own food source. Foghome can tell the characters several things:

- No vegetation survives for long in Bazzoxan. Foghome thinks this is the result of the corrupting influence of the Betrayers' Rise.
- He is a follower of Melora the Wild Mother, but he recognizes the temple as a former holy place of Avandra the Change Bringer. He hopes to honor both deities by cultivating new life in the midst of the death and destruction that haunts this place.
- While meditating the other night, he felt something surge within the earth nearby—a warm and kindly presence reminiscent of the Prime Deities. He suspects the presence is a sign that a relic of the Calamity has awakened within the Betrayers' Rise.

> [!quote] Firbolgs of Exandria
> 
> Firbolgs are forest-dwelling Humanoids native to the Greying Wildlands of Wildemount. They are on the tall side of Medium, and their bodies are covered with thick fur ranging in color from tones of brown and ruddy red to cool gray and blue, and occasionally in hues of pink or green. They have floppy, pointed ears and broad, pink noses.
> 
> A firbolg nonplayer character encountered in Exandria might have one or both of the following traits:
> 
> **Powerful Build.** The firbolg counts as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift.
> 
> **Speech of Beast and Leaf.** The firbolg can communicate in a limited way with Beasts and Plants. These creatures understand the meaning of the firbolg's words, though the firbolg has no ability to understand their languages. In addition, the firbolg has advantage on Charisma checks it makes to influence a Beast or Plant.
^firbolgs-of-exandria

##### Foghome and the Jewel

If asked about the Jewel of Three Prayers, Foghome has no recollection of an item bearing that name. If he examines the jewel, he correctly senses three fragments of divine power within it, one awake and two slumbering. He also tells the characters that one of the fragments in the jewel is similar to the presence he felt within the earth while he was meditating.

Foghome invites the characters to visit him at the temple any time. He mentions that he meditates to commune with the Wild Mother in the evenings, and he would be happy to reach out to her for more answers on the characters' behalf if they decide to join him one night.

If the characters take him up on his offer, they receive a vision during Foghome's meditation:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You see a young human, curls plastered to his brow by sweat, sinking to his knees in the garden. His eyes betray a lack of sleep, and despite the softness of his features, he looks like he has experienced more pain than any one person should bear. "They're counting on me," he whispers. "They need me, but I'm exhausted and frightened. What do I do? Please. Someone tell me—what do I do?"
> 
> The moons race across the sky, soon replaced by the angry red sun that rises before a fateful battle. Five silhouettes approach the temple, and one claps the kneeling figure on the back. Their voices are muffled, as if coming at you through water, but you see them embrace, standing strong, before marching off to war.
^112

When the vision concludes, the characters fall [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) on the ground, having momentarily passed out. Foghome doesn't see the vision, but he sees the characters fall [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) and then awaken moments later. If they admit to seeing the vision, he asks them to describe it before nodding slowly and explaining he has seen the vision before. He believes the central figure in the vision to be a hero of the Calamity and recounts the old stories of Bazzoxan's origin:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "The Kryn capital of Rosohna was the Betrayer Gods' citadel of Ghor Dranas in the time before the Calamity, and the Betrayers' Rise was once a fortress protecting Ghor Dranas. In the darkest days of the Calamity, the Prime Deities and their most loyal champions laid siege to Ghor Dranas before capturing the Betrayers' Rise and routing the Betrayer Gods' forces there. Though storytellers have long since forgotten the names of many of those heroes, the force of their bonds still resonates across the land."
^113

If the characters ask him to elaborate, Foghome draws their attention to several alcoves where the plants are markedly healthier than the rest of those within the temple. Engraved on the back walls of the alcoves are the following timeworn words in Common (parts of the messages that are no longer legible are indicated by dashes):

- "Friends forever. Don't——forget——"
- "You owe me a drink in Marquet, A——"
- "I am writing this——record of me stating——I will never, ever duel you again."
- "This——written proof——promise to show you the mountains of my home one day."
- "We love you. We will always be with you."

#### B6: Wall of the Unforgotten

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A stretch of stone wall is carved with names and wreathed in dried flowers, silver necklaces, and ropes weighted with good-luck charms. The ground near the wall is cluttered with trinkets left there as offerings. A drow of the Aurora Watch prays near a corner of the wall.
^115

The Wall of the Unforgotten is a memorial site for the soldiers of the Aurora Watch. The wall is crowded with names, most scratched into the surface with knives.

The praying figure is a lawful neutral, drow [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of the Luxon named Kalym Telaarin. Kalym is 300 years old and has many scars on his otherwise handsome face. His left leg from the knee down is an intricate prosthetic carved from chitinous black rock and ringed with bands of pale purple light. As the characters approach, Kalym rises to his feet and says sternly, "Be respectful. They've earned their rest, and they deserve to have that rest honored."

If the characters show Kalym the carving they received from the young drow in the infirmary (area B3), his demeanor softens. He explains that it's part of a recent practice taken up by younger members of the Aurora Watch: when a soldier is not sure of living long enough to make friends that will hold a memorial for them, they arrange to have a keepsake of theirs placed by the wall in their honor.

Kalym directs the characters to place the scout's carving amid the items strewn at the base of the wall. After the characters do this, Kalym kneels and resumes praying. If the characters stay until he is done a couple minutes later, Kalym rises and gifts each willing character with a magical Mote of Possibility, which manifests as a flash of silver light as he touches each character's forehead in turn. A character who fails a saving throw or misses on an attack roll can use a reaction to expend their Mote of Possibility, allowing them to reroll the d20. The character must use the new roll. A Mote of Possibility vanishes from a character after 24 hours or when it is expended.

Kalym returns to duty after imparting his gifts. He has no useful information about the Betrayers' Rise, the Jewel of Three Prayers, or the comings and goings of faction agents in Bazzoxan.

#### B7: The Ready Room

The Ready Room is Bazzoxan's only inn and one of the only structures in town that doesn't look like a military barracks:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A large barn with a steeply pointed roof looms over the battered structures near the center of town. Over the double door hangs a sign that bears the tavern's name, The Ready Room, in Undercommon, Orc, Goblin, and Common.
^117

The Ready Room is run by Delez and Prima Demona, a brother-and-sister team who are both lawful neutral [drow](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md). Delez runs the bar and the kitchen and handles most interactions with customers, while Prima manages the finances and inventory.

The ground floor contains piles of tools (lanterns, shovels, ladders, and the like) and a dozen wooden stalls that have been turned into curtained sleeping quarters, each one holding five wooden cots. A rope-and-pulley hoist functions like an elevator, allowing access to a spacious loft where the proprietors have equipped a bar and surrounded it with two dozen stools that are mostly occupied by patrons whenever the place is open for business. Behind the bar is a cooking space with a stove, where Derez prepares food for guests. A curtain behind the bar conceals a small office and storage room, where Prima spends much of her time.

A tankard of beer costs 1 cp, while a bowl of mushy rice and overcooked fish costs 2 cp. The use of a cot costs 2 sp per night. Characters can purchase any common adventuring equipment at the Ready Room, but all such items sell for double their normal price. Although Prima doesn't appreciate her prices being questioned, a character who makes a successful DC 17 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can get her to lower the prices to only a 50 percent markup.

##### Rivals

The rivals like to gather for food and drinks at the bar. This is a good place for the characters to sit and chat with them, especially if the two groups didn't interact much in chapter 2. It's also a chance to show how the rivals' travels have begun to weigh on them; there is a different quality to the tone of their boasts, as well as the way they address each other and the characters (see "Rivals in Bazzoxan" earlier in the chapter).

##### Question and Answers

Question, a chaotic neutral, tiefling [monastic operative](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/monastic-operative-crcotn.md) (see appendix A), can be found lounging around the Ready Room at all hours. Unlike most others in Bazzoxan, Question almost always has a smile on her face.

The tiefling doesn't take notice of the characters unless they make contact first, at which point she performs an awkward little bow. After introducing herself, Question launches into an excited spiel:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Tell me you feel it, too," says the tiefling with a grin. "My comrades don't, but I do. The history surrounding this place. The romance of heroes fighting against impossible odds, sacrificing everything for the sake of defending the world. All done for people who would never know them, never think of them, never be able to thank them. Simply because it was the right thing to do. And ages later, we now see the Aurora Watch somehow doing the same. And they don't even know it!"
^11a

Question calls this phenomenon, related to the cyclical nature of history, "mythic resonance." She believes that acts of monumental courage leave an impression on the world that lingers after all memory of the deeds has faded. Question theorizes that this has occurred in Bazzoxan, and the ancient battles of the Calamity are still echoing here today.

##### What Question Knows

Question is eager to show characters her sketchbook. She explains that her drawings are based on research she conducted in the archives of the Cobalt Soul in Ank'Harel, the city where she has lived for the past five years. On the pages of the sketchbook, characters can see the following drawings:

- A sketch of an island bathed in the moonlight of Catha and Ruidus, both full. The island is covered with trees, marble pillars, and crystal shards and resembles the final chamber in the Emerald Grotto.
- A rough drawing of what appears to be a more elaborate version of the Jewel of Three Prayers. It is larger and has three delicate spires inlaid with stones.
- A rubbing of a symbol that depicts a long-haired woman peering into the distance. A character who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check identifies this as the holy symbol of Avandra the Change Bringer. Question explains that this rubbing was taken from a wall carving in the Betrayers' Rise (see area R1 later in the chapter).
- A folk ballad, written in Undercommon, that speaks of an unnamed "halfway god," a champion who was given so much power by three of the Prime Deities during the Calamity that he became nearly divine himself.

##### Question and the Jewel

If asked about the Jewel of Three Prayers, Question speaks of it with reverent awe, calling it a "lost Vestige." Though she doesn't know the relic's true nature, she believes the jewel was an ordinary amulet until it was filled with divine power during the Calamity.

If the characters show Question the jewel, the tiefling quivers with excitement and immediately requests a closer look. After a minute of inspection, she says that this object is the key to the mythic cycle that resonates throughout Bazzoxan. She begs the characters to contact her again if they learn more about the jewel during their stay in Bazzoxan.

##### Question's Allies

Question doesn't have much to say about the other members of her expedition, dismissing them as the sort who prefer excitement over introspection. A character who succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check discerns that Question is hiding something; if confronted, she admits that she is terrified of going inside the Betrayers' Rise. She explains that after entering the temple with the other expedition members, she heard voices calling to her, which nearly caused her to run away screaming. Instead, she feigned sudden illness and returned to town after promising to make the next trip inside. She expresses concern that her compatriots have yet to return, but she holds out hope that they'll make it back out.

##### Aloysia Telfan

During their conversation with Question, characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 12 or higher notice a gaunt figure in scarlet robes nearby, eavesdropping. This figure, [Aloysia Telfan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aloysia-telfan-crcotn.md), is a lawful evil, elf [occult initiate](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-initiate-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) who thirsts for knowledge and power. She approaches the characters, if they don't accost her first, and greets them politely.

Aloysia gets right to the point: she wants to find an ancient prayer site deep inside the Betrayers' Rise—and based on what she has learned of the characters from their conversation with Question, she surmises that such a mission would be beneficial to them as well. She offers to pay the characters 50 gp each to accompany her, though they can get her up to 100 gp each with a successful DC 13 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check if they haggle. If pressed to reveal what she's after, Aloysia explains that she's looking for a crimson mineral called ruidium that is said to be infused with the power of Ruidus. She says nothing about her organization, the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream, unless someone asks about it by name. In that case, she says that the Consortium is a group of folklore aficionados.

##### What Aloysia Knows

Aloysia believes the following facts to be true:

- Fragmented historical records tell of an unidentified hero of the Calamity who hailed from the lands of Wildemount. He was born under the full moon of Ruidus and wields the vermilion moon's power. (Partially true. Alyxian was marked by Ruidus, but he creates ruidium on his own, not by drawing on the moon's power.)
- This hero participated in climactic battles across the continents of Wildemount and Marquet—including the battle at the Betrayers' Rise. (True.)
- The hero died in the battle at the Betrayers' Rise and was brought back to life as a vengeful revenant by Avandra the Change Bringer. (Mostly false. Alyxian nearly died but was healed and granted further power by Avandra.)
- The hero wore a pendant that contained the power of three gods. This pendant is the key to acquiring the ruidium her organization seeks. (Partially true. The Jewel of Three Prayers holds the power of three gods and, in its Exalted State, can be used to open the rift to the Netherdeep in Cael Morrow, as described in chapter 5.)

##### Roleplaying Aloysia

Assuming the characters are cordial, the ambitious occultist steers the conversation to her interests at every turn, while maintaining a pleasant demeanor and answering just enough of the characters' questions to keep them from walking away.

If the characters turn down her offer, Aloysia's charm vanishes immediately, replaced by cold disdain. Additionally, if any character mentions having received a vision from the Apotheon or reveals that the characters possess the Jewel of Three Prayers, Aloysia becomes fixated on obtaining the jewel for her faction.

## Betrayers' Rise

Any time while in Bazzoxan, the characters can choose to travel north to the Betrayers' Rise, which looms over Bazzoxan.

A steep, winding staircase, wide enough for four Medium creatures to walk abreast, leads to a large gate built into the facade of the Betrayers' Rise. Read or paraphrase the following when the characters come close enough to see the details of the structure:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The Betrayers' Rise is both ominous and beautiful. Its black walls are carved with intricate reliefs, many of them depicting scenes of torture. Lifelike grotesques of leering demons perch high above, peering down at you with contempt.
> 
> An immense double door forms the entrance. This gate is made of onyx inlaid with copper and silver. Guards of the Aurora Watch stand between you and the demonic fortress.
^122

The Betrayer Gods used demons to defend this fortress-temple against the Prime Deities. The scenes depicted on the fortress walls depict the Prime Deities being tormented. The outer doors are extremely heavy but well balanced and require a combined Strength of 44 to open or close.

The Aurora Watch has 2d6 [veterans](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) (drow, humans, and orcs) stationed outside the Betrayers' Rise at any time. These guards ensure that the doors remain closed to prevent demons and other evil creatures from escaping. At least one character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check before the guards will allow one or more characters to get within 30 feet of the outer doors.

### Gloomstalker Escape

As the characters examine the Betrayers' Rise and its entrance more closely, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Shouting erupts from the soldiers just as the colossal doors fly open. Two shadowy, winged creatures burst through the opening, immediately take flight, and screech as they dive toward you, their ebon talons extended.
^124

The escaped creatures are two [gloomstalkers](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/gloomstalker-egw.md) (see appendix A). The soldiers stationed outside can assist the characters in battling the gloomstalkers, or you can have them rush inside to help three gravely injured Aurora Watch soldiers (lawful good, orc [knights](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md)) in area R1.

Each gloomstalker fights until it is reduced to half its hit points or fewer, then soars away. After seeing the characters in combat against the gloomstalkers, the Aurora Watch soldiers hold the party in high regard. From now on, the characters can freely enter the Betrayers' Rise whenever they like—including right away, if they so desire. After the characters have either entered the Betrayers' Rise or returned to town, the soldiers tend to their wounded and close the doors.

### Features of the Betrayers' Rise

The interior of the Betrayers' Rise has the following features:

- **Black Stone..** Unless otherwise noted, all surfaces in the Betrayers' Rise are made of smooth, shiny black stone. The power that pervades the place prevents the architecture from being affected by magic such as [stone shape](/compendium/spells/stone-shape.md).
- **Ceilings..** Unless otherwise noted, the vaulted ceilings of the temple's chambers are 50 feet high, and its hallways are 20 feet high.
- **Light..** The interior of the Betrayers' Rise contains no light sources unless otherwise noted.
- **Shifting Halls..** The interior of the Betrayers' Rise is different for each group that enters. The chaotic magic of the Abyss warps the configuration to stymie explorers and baffle cartographers. The characters experience a particular version of the temple—the one shown on the Betrayers' Rise map. If Aurora Watch soldiers or the rivals enter, they experience a different configuration.

#### Expanding the Betrayers' Rise

If you want to or need to, you can create new maps for the Betrayers' Rise, new encounters there, and other routes through it. The Betrayers' Rise Encounters table provides some suggestions for unsettling creatures that a group might encounter while delving into these new areas, and you can use the "treasure tables" in "chapter 7" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" to generate treasure guarded by these creatures.

**Betrayers' Rise Encounters**

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | The characters enter a room lined with flickering candles, only to discover that their shadows have detached from them and transformed into [shadow demons](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/shadow-demon.md) (one per character). |
| 2 | Four [ochre jellies](/compendium/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md) burble along the walls of a hallway, looking for prey to devour. |
| 3 | A [yochlol](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/yochlol.md) in giant spider form skitters around in an antechamber draped in spider webs. |
| 4 | A [yochlol](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/yochlol.md) in drow form wears the insectile armor of the Aurora Watch. Claiming to be a lost Aurora Watch soldier, the demon tries to lure the characters into greater danger. |
| 5 | Two [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) [barlguras](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) ambush the characters. |
| 6 | A passageway opens into what was once a coliseum and now contains three enraged [nightmares](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/nightmare.md). |
| 7 | A gurgling, acidic river cuts through a cavern where three [ropers](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/roper.md) stealthily await. |
| 8 | Three [chasmes](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/chasme.md) emerge from their hive, which has overtaken what was once a chandelier. |
| 9 | A [glabrezu](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/glabrezu.md) tempts all who come into its chamber with promises of riches. Anyone it can't bribe into serving it is attacked. |
| 10 | Orange light emanates from the depths of a chasm, where a [balor](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/balor.md) sleeps in molten lava. If it is attacked, the demon wakes. The characters, who have no chance of defeating this powerful demon in combat, must flee or die. |
^betrayers-rise-encounters

### Retreat and Reinforcements

To survive the trials of the Betrayers' Rise, the characters might need to retreat to Bazzoxan to regroup and rest. If the characters retreat from the Betrayers' Rise, new demons emerge from the Abyssal portals in the depths of the temple after 8 hours to populate empty areas. Roll a d6 for each area in the Betrayers' Rise that the characters explored on their previous trip. On a roll of 6, the area has become home to one or more new creatures, determined by rolling another d6 and consulting the Betrayers' Rise Reinforcements table.

**Betrayers' Rise Reinforcements**

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 1d6 [quasits](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) nesting in the corpses of the area's previous inhabitants or crawling on the walls in centipede form |
| 2 | 1 [chasme](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/chasme.md) clinging to the ceiling |
| 3 | 1 [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) [barlgura](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) standing guard |
| 4 | 1d4 [shadow demons](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/shadow-demon.md) lurking in the darkness |
| 5 | 3d6 [manes](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/manes.md) looking for a more powerful demon to lead them |
| 6 | 1 [gloomstalker](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/gloomstalker-egw.md) (see appendix A) feeding on the corpse of a giant rat and hungry for more food |
^betrayers-rise-reinforcements

### Locations in the Betrayers' Rise (R1-R8)

The following locations are keyed to the Betrayers' Rise map.

#### R1: Entrance

When the characters enter the Betrayers' Rise, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You stand on a bloodstained bridge that extends over a chasm of swirling silver mist. On the far side of the bridge is a closed double door of black stone inscribed with a circle containing the profile of a smiling woman. The symbol is gouged with deep marks, as if something with claws has tried, but failed, to scour it from the stone.
^12a

A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the engraving as the symbol of Avandra the Change Bringer. If the characters have the Jewel of Three Prayers, add:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This double door begins to radiate faint crimson light. The light slowly pulses, as if beckoning you to touch it. The _Jewel of Three Prayers_ grows warm to the touch and pulses in sync with the glowing door.
^12b

The characters can't pass through the double door leading to area R2 unless they have the Jewel of Three Prayers. The doors glow whenever the jewel comes within 20 feet of them. While the doors glow, they can be opened with a gentle touch; they can't be opened by any other method. If the characters don't have the jewel, they must turn back and try to acquire it from their rivals, or they can descend into the misty chasm beneath them (see "Misty Chasm" below) if they have the means to do so safely.

##### Outer Doors

The Aurora Watch won't allow the outer doors to remain open. If the characters want to leave the Betrayers' Rise after the outer doors are closed, they must open the doors themselves.

##### Misty Chasm

Beneath the bridge is an 80-foot-long vertical shaft that opens into a 1,000-foot-deep chasm (see area R15) shrouded in silvery mist. Any character who listens intently hears hissing voices emanating from inside the chasm. The voices say the following in Common:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "Together. Yes, we can break them together. Come to us. Let us catch you. Let us have you. Come to us. We won't let you fall."
^12e

The shaft leading down to the chasm is too sheer to climb without the use of magic or climbing gear. Any character who falls into the chasm takes 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage from the plunge.

#### R2: Hall of Holes

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls of this hallway are covered with carvings that depict a great battle involving mortals, celestials, and fiends. A faint whistling noise emerges from the walls, sounding almost like snoring.
^130

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check recognizes that the wall carvings depict the Battle of the Barbed Fields. This fight was a climactic battle of the Calamity, in which the devotees of the Prime Deities broke through the garrison at the Betrayers' Rise and reached the walls of Ghor Dranas. Prominently depicted in one scene is a proud, melancholy warrior with curly hair and carrying a spear and shield. By his side are two figures; a white-haired girl no more than twelve years old, and a young adult woman with hair that flows behind her, turning into a road upon which countless soldiers march. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check realizes that the latter two figures are common depictions of the gods Sehanine the Moon Weaver and Avandra the Change Bringer.

No check is needed to identify the source of the snoring sound: it comes from the walls. Close examination reveals that the walls have scores of 1-inch-diameter holes drilled into them. As the characters move along the corridor, eyeballs, teeth, and liquid flesh begin to ooze from the holes, pooling on the floor. After 1 round, this grotesque slurry forms into three [gibbering mouthers](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) that attack the characters. One mouther appears at each end of the hall, and the third appears in the middle of the hallway to the west.

##### Escape Route

The double door leading to area R1 closes behind the characters unless it is held or wedged open. It glows red when the Jewel of Three Prayers is within 20 feet of it. While the double door is glowing, it opens with a touch; otherwise, it can't be opened.

#### R3: Vestibule

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This chamber is empty except for a skull-shaped vase on a small, semicircular table resting against the back wall of an alcove in the north wall. Six narrower alcoves line the east and west walls. The northeast alcove seems to have once led to a hallway, but it has caved in.
^133

A character can clear the rubble blocking the northeast hallway in 1 hour; reduce the time proportionately if other characters assist. If the rubble is cleared, characters can follow the tunnel beyond it that leads to area R8.

##### Northwest Alcove

On the back wall of this alcove is scrawled the following message in Abyssal: "To me, touch your hand. To me, relinquish hope. To you, accept death. To you, invite hollowness." A character who places their hand on this wall feels it writhe beneath their touch. If the character succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check, they understand that the wall seems to want to devour their body, but that the wall can consume only someone who has accepted that they'll die and doesn't struggle against that fate.

While touching the wall, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom check to make peace with their own death. On a failed check, nothing happens, and the character must rest for at least 1 hour before they can attempt the check again. On a successful check, the wall churns and pulls the character through it, whereupon the character emerges in a narrow hallway (the southern part of area R4). Anyone or anything that character is holding is also pulled through the wall.

A character who succeeds on the check gains the following benefit and drawback:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> - **Benefit..** The character has advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for the next 24 hours.
> - **Drawback..** The character has disadvantage on death saving throws for the next 24 hours.
^135

##### Secrets of the Skull

The skull vase and the table in the north alcove are the keys to revealing the hidden entrance to the Basilica of Revelry (area R9). Close examination reveals that the vase contains the withered remains of a bouquet of lilies.

A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 13 or higher notices jagged markings along the edge of the table, which make up the following phrase in Abyssal: "Cast that which you value into Oblivion." A character who can read the writing and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes that "Oblivion" refers to Tharizdun, the Betrayer God of emptiness and entropy, also known as the Chained Oblivion.

To open the entrance, a character must place something of value inside the vase, such as a bouquet of fresh flowers, a gemstone, coins totaling at least 25 gp, or anything else the character regards as valuable. Once a satisfactory offering has been placed within the skull-shaped vase, its eye sockets flash red, the offering decays to the point of being worthless, and the wall behind the table slides upward, revealing a long tunnel that eventually leads down to area R12.

#### R4: Path of Emptiness

Characters are [deafened](/rules/conditions.md#deafened) while in this corridor. The only sound any of them can hear is the beating of their own heart.

##### One-Way Secret Door

The wall that lies between area R4 and area R3 is a featureless surface when viewed from this side, offering no way of returning to area R3. This one-way passage can't be navigated, except with a [passwall](/compendium/spells/passwall.md) spell or similar magic.

#### R5: Flagellant's Path

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You enter a chamber that reeks of death and incense. To the west is an open archway that leads into a small side room, and to the north is a hallway flanked by two statues of swollen, worm-bodied abominations, each with three arms and the hairless head of a howling, fang-toothed man wearing a crown of black spikes.
> 
> The hallway past the statues is lined with dozens of curved, quivering blades and ends at a double door. Mounted above the double doors is an eight-inch-tall canister made of translucent crystal.
^13a

A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the statues as depictions of Torog the Crawling King, god of enslavement and torture. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 12 or higher notice a phrase written in Undercommon on the floor between the two statues that reads: "Revel in the pain you inflict on others. Relish the pain you suffer yourself as an offering to the Crawling King."

##### Bladed Corridor

The corridor north of the statues has twitching silver blades protruding from its walls. Whenever one or more creatures are in the hall, the floor tilts to one side and then the other so that creatures stumble into the blades. A creature that moves into the corridor or starts its turn there must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) slashing damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The first time a character takes damage from the blades, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A dim burgundy glow suffuses the corridor, illuminating every razor-sharp bit of metal as dark fluid begins to pour into the canister above the double door.
^13c

##### Opening the Double Door

The double door at the north end of the corridor can be opened only after the crystal canister is filled with blood or demonic ichor. To meet this requirement, the bladed walls must deal a total of 70 slashing damage to creatures that have blood or demonic ichor in their bodies. A character within reach of the canister can pour blood into it; each ounce of blood poured into the canister reduces by 5 the amount of damage needed to open the doors.

If the crystal canister is destroyed, the characters have no way to disable the hall's trap. The canister is a Tiny object with AC 13, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

##### Trap Reset

The corridor stops tilting and resets itself after 1 hour or when the double door is opened, whereupon all blood in the crystal canister disappears.

#### R6: Cloister of Penitence

Opening the door to this room releases three hostile [flameskulls](/compendium/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md)—the remains of torturers who served the Betrayer Gods long ago.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The floor of this small room is crusted with dried blood, and the walls are lined with hooks, spiked whips, and other implements of torture or self-flagellation. Slouched in a corner is a desiccated human body in acolyte's robes.
^140

##### Treasure

A character who searches the corpse finds a pouch containing 22 gp and four stoppered vials that each contain 1 ounce of blood. This blood can be poured into the canister at the north end of the Flagellant's Path (see area R5 for details).

#### R7: Stairs Down

Five-foot-wide stairs of black stone cling to the walls of a rectangular shaft. The stairs descend 100 feet to area R11.

As the characters make their descent, the sound of distant wailing (emanating from the statue in area R12) grows louder.

#### R8: Spiders' Chancel

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A haunting song echoes through this half-collapsed chamber, interspersed with a clicking sound that seems to reverberate in your bones. Thick spiderwebs, giving off a pale green glow, stretch from floor to ceiling. Crawling in the webs are two giant spiders and two creatures that look like drow but with the lower bodies of monstrous spiders. Four corpses cocooned in webs rest atop the debris near the west wall.
^144

The two [driders](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/drider.md) are former drow warriors of the Aurora Watch mutated by the demonic magic of Lolth the Spider Queen. The two [giant spiders](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) in this area have also been tainted, changing their type to Fiend.

The driders and the giant spiders attack intruders on sight, pursuing those that flee.

##### Hidden Singers

A [see invisibility](/compendium/spells/see-invisibility.md) spell or similar magic reveals a mural composed of ghostly figures on the walls of the chamber. The figures all have their mouths open as though singing or screaming. One figure in the middle of the north wall holds a large book that glows faintly and is warm to the touch. Pressing on the book in the mural opens a secret door in the northeast corner of the room, which can also be found by examining that section of wall and succeeding on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Beyond the secret door is a small room lined with moldering, leather-bound books. Each tome contains barely legible scrawlings in Abyssal written by an unsteady hand, detailing the demon lords' alliances with the Betrayer Gods during the Calamity.

A character who spends 10 minutes searching the small chamber finds a book buried in the debris, opened to a page that shows a drawing of a stained-glass window. Written beneath the drawing is the following mantra:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> "First praise be to the Spider Queen, whose kingdom was forsaken. Next, exult the Ruiner, whose spear shook the green earth. In turn, pay homage to Oblivion and the ending of all things. And last, I give myself to the Crawling King."
^146

A character who can read the writing and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence check realizes that this is a code or instruction. (It provides the correct sequence of sigils to touch to open the stained-glass mural in area R9.)

##### Treasure

The corpses are the remains of an Aurora Watch expedition that was trapped in the Betrayers' Rise. A character who searches the bodies finds an onyx-hilted longsword that has become a sword of vengeance haunted by the spirit of its former wielder.

### Locations in the Betrayers' Rise (R9-R16)

#### R9: Basilica of Revelry

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Two rows of black stone pillars marbled with white veins support the vaulted ceiling of this hall, the floor of which is polished to a mirror-like sheen. Ornate brass braziers rest at the feet of four of the pillars, and faint music fills the hall.
^14a

The music has no readily identifiable source, and the four braziers are bolted to the floor. If one or more characters enter the room, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The four braziers ignite, their bowls filling with pale flames that coalesce into dancing, humanoid forms. The glow from the flames glints off the north wall, where a towering mosaic of stained glass depicts a maelstrom of color, within which are nine symbols. The image shifts even as you stare at it.
^14b

Each [dancing flame](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/dancing-flame-crcotn.md) uses the [succubus](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/succubus.md)/[incubus](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md) stat block, with these changes:

- The flame sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If it leaves the hall or is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and can't re-form for 24 hours.
- It lacks the Shapechanger trait and the Etherealness action.
- Its Claw attack deals fire damage instead of slashing damage.

The dancing flames appear to beckon to characters who are closest to them. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check intuits, based on the way they move in time with the music, that the flames are looking for dance partners.

A character who uses an action to dance within 5 feet of a flame creature can make a DC 12 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) or Charisma ([Performance](/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check. On a successful check, the dancing flame flickers brightly with joy and uses its reaction to fly to the stained-glass mosaic and touch the next symbol in the sequence needed to open it (see "Stained-Glass Mosaic" below). On a failed check, or if a character approaches within 5 feet of a flame but refuses to dance, the flame attacks.

##### Stained-Glass Mosaic

The 10-foot-wide section of wall at the north end of the basilica resembles a tall, stained-glass window. Its imagery changes constantly, like the patterns in a kaleidoscope, but the nine symbols remain static. A character who succeeds on a DC 11 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes these as the symbols of evil gods. The symbols and the gods they represent are summarized in the Symbols of the Gods table.

If four of the symbols are pressed in the correct order, as noted in the Symbol Sequence table, a door opens at the base of the wall, leading to a hallway (area R10). A creature that presses an incorrect symbol must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The stained-glass mosaic can be bypassed by breaking through it with a successful DC 12 Strength check or by destroying it. The mosaic has AC 11, 10 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying the mosaic causes the flame creatures in the hall to attack. Moreover, each creature in the hall when the mosaic breaks must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw unless it is a Construct, a Fiend, or an Undead. On a failed save, the creature is cursed and can't regain hit points until the effect on that creature is ended by a [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic.

If destroyed, the stained-glass window repairs itself after 1 hour.

#### R10: Supplicant's Pit

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls of this hallway are decorated with carvings of supine figures and chained bodies. The floor is covered by a nest of black chains.
> 
> The sound of distant wailing comes from a dark, circular hole in the floor at the north end of the hall.
^14e

A creature that enters this hall immediately feels weighed down and senses a terrible dread clawing at the back of its mind. The creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw and succeeds automatically if it is immune to the [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition. On a failed save, the creature falls [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) and its speed is reduced to 0 as it is forced to grovel before an unseen presence. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it gains immunity to this effect for the next 24 hours.

##### Chains of Darkness

When a creature falls [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) in this hall, the chains on the floor slither toward it, and the figures carved in the walls drone in low voices, "Imprison those who cannot resist you. Drag all life into darkness." The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be [grappled](/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the chains (escape DC 15). Until it escapes, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. Any creature that is not [grappled](/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the chains can use an action to try to free a chained creature within reach, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Whatever the result of the check, the creature making the attempt takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage.

##### Circular Hole

The circular hole at the north end of the hall is the mouth of a shaft that descends 10 feet before opening in the ceiling of area R12. The distance from the floor of this hallway to the floor of area R12 is 100 feet. A character who falls down the hole can try to catch the outstretched hand of the northernmost stone arm in area R12, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw and reducing the fall from 100 feet to 30 feet. The character can climb down the rest of the way with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### R11: Stairs Up

Five-foot-wide stairs of black stone cling to the walls of a rectangular shaft. The stairs ascend 100 feet to area R7.

From this area, the wailing in R12 is loud and impossible to ignore.

#### R12: Threshold of the Excoriated

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The awful wailing noise gets even louder as you approach this chamber. A beam of light from above illuminates a statue in the middle of the room. The statue, made of pale marble, is shaped like a man on his knees, arms pinioned behind his back, trussed up in chains that cut into his skin. Hooks line the corners of the figure's mouth, pulling his lips away from his teeth, and smaller barbs encircle his eyes, holding the eyelids open. All the while, hideous noise comes out of the statue's open mouth—yet still, its expression is one of ecstasy. A double door made of iron is set into the statue's chest; these surfaces have no handles.
> 
> A triangle, each side forty feet long, is carved into the floor around the statue, surrounding it. At each of the triangle's points, a stone arm juts up from the floor with its hand outstretched.
^153

A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic emanating from the iron doors in the statue's chest. Similar auras are apparent in the palms of the stone arms that are within the spell's range.

##### Wailing Statue

Any creature within 30 feet of the statue that can hear the wailing sound coming from it must make a successful DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become cursed by Torog's hunger. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to the effect of the wailing statue for 24 hours. The curse has the following effects on a creature:

- At the start of each of its turns, the creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must use its action to harm another creature it can see, using a spell or an attack that deals the greatest amount of damage.
- While the creature has fewer than half its hit points, its successful weapon attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) psychic damage.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the curse of Torog remains in effect on the creature until ended by a [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic, or until the creature enters area R16.

##### Arms of Torog

The northernmost of these three statues is 70 feet tall, the one to the east is 40 feet tall, and the one to the west is 20 feet tall. Each arm ends in an outstretched hand.

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 13 or higher notice that each one of the arms bears a throbbing, purple-black pustule on its palm. Each pustule has AC 17, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. When a pustule is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and one side of the triangle engraved on the floor begins to glow white. Destroying all three pustules lights up the entire triangle and unlocks the doors embedded in the statue's chest. If the pustules are all destroyed, they re-form after 1 hour, at which point the doors close and become locked again unless they are held open or are opened from the inside.

##### Iron Doors

The doors in the statue's chest open only if the three pustules on the palms of the stone arms have been destroyed. Beyond the doors is a narrow passage that descends to area R16.

##### South Hallway

When one or more characters enter the hallway to the south, they hear a loud grinding noise. This is the sound of a stone slab rising from the floor to block the entrance to area R14. This slab has no handle or keyhole. Defeating the fiendish orcs in area R14 or using a [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic causes the slab to sink back into the floor; it can't be moved or breached otherwise.

#### R13: Lightless Labyrinth

This network of 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-high tunnels zigzags in incomprehensible directions.

##### Entrances

The tunnel leading north from this labyrinth connects with area R12. The south entrance is a 3-foot-tall crawlway that ends 45 feet above the floor of area R14.

##### Navigating the Labyrinth

When the characters enter the labyrinth, they're faced with a choice of three paths: one lit by violet [continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md) spells, one by red [continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md) spells, and one shrouded in impenetrable magical darkness. Following any of the paths leads them to another three-way fork with the same choices available, and then another. The way to get through the labyrinth most quickly is always to take the fork shrouded in darkness.

After choosing three paths, the characters emerge at one of the entrances. If they chose the darkened path all three times, they emerge at the opposite side from where they entered. If they chose any of the illuminated paths, they emerge at the same place where they entered, and each character must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) as the endlessly zigzagging pathways drain their resolve.

##### Hints

A character who makes a successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recalls one of Torog's commandments: "Seek and exalt places where no light touches." If they aren't sure what that means, a character can guess that the darkened passages of the labyrinth are related to this commandment by making a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.

#### R14: Blood Font of the Ruiner

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This chamber has a flat, fifty-foot-high ceiling, and its black stone walls are covered with deep gouges and lined with alcoves to the east and west. In the middle of the area is a circular pool filled to the brim with blood. Standing in the pool are two seven-foot-tall orcs, one pouring blood from a golden bowl over the other's head. The creatures snarl and turn to you.
^15d

The [creatures](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/fiendish-orc-crcotn.md) are two [orc war chiefs](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc-war-chief.md) that were once valiant soldiers of the Aurora Watch. Both have been corrupted by demonic magic and have the following changes to their statistics:

- Their creature type is Fiend.
- They speak Abyssal as well as Common and Orc.
- They have immunity to fire and poison damage.

On their first turn in combat, the orcs bellow a prayer to Gruumsh in Abyssal, activating the power of the blood font.

##### Blood Font

This pool is 2 feet deep and filled with blood kept fresh by demonic magic. When the orcs pray to Gruumsh, they activate the blood font, causing the following effects to occur:

- Stone slabs rise from the floor to block the north and south exits (unless both slabs were already closed). A [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic can force a slab to sink back into the floor.
- When both exits are sealed after the orcs pray to Gruumsh, the pool of blood begins to boil and overflow. The boiling blood starts to flood the room, rising at a rate of 5 feet per minute to a maximum depth of 45 feet.
- A creature that ends its turn in the boiling blood takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.

Killing both orcs or forcing open either exit causes the boiling blood to drain out of the room through holes that open in the floor, lowering the blood's depth by 5 feet per round.

##### Crawlway

A character who searches for a way out of the sealed-off room can use an action to make a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. On a successful check, the character spots a 3-foot-high opening in the back wall of the southeast alcove, 45 feet above the ground. The opening is the entrance to a crawlway that leads to area R13. Climbing the wall to reach this opening requires a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### R15: Misty Chasm

A short hallway connects area R14 with the chasm south of it. The archway at the south end of the corridor is carved to resemble the open-mouthed, fanged visage of Gruumsh the Ruiner when seen from inside the chasm. Fire fills one of the visage's eye sockets, courtesy of a [continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md) spell.

Describe the stone-carved face as follows when one or more characters can see it:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A snarling face of stone is carved into the north wall of the foggy chasm, its gaping mouth forming the entrance to a hallway. Fire blazes in one of the face's eye sockets, and its fangs are stained with blood.
^161

The 1,000-foot-deep chasm swirls with fog that makes the entire area "lightly obscured". The carving of Gruumsh's face is 100 feet below the opening in the ceiling to area R1 and 900 feet above the chasm's floor.

When a creature passes through the gaping mouth of the stone-carved face, a planar rift opens in the floor on the east side of the chasm (see "Abyssal Rift" below), and a hostile [vrock](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md) flies out of it. The vrock begins searching the chasm for food, attacking the characters on sight.

##### Abyssal Rift

The planar rift is a gateway to the Abyss and looks like a 10-foot-wide, 20-foot-long orifice filled with impenetrable darkness. Horrible shrieks emanate from the rift and can be heard throughout the chasm for as long as the rift remains open. The rift closes after 1 minute, but a new one appears whenever a creature passes through the carving of Gruumsh's face.

A creature that enters the rift from this side is magically transported, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, to the Abyss. The creature emerges from a similar rift located inside a colossal cyclone of poisonous gas. Trapped in the cyclone are the shrieking spirits of countless evil souls condemned to the Abyss. Demons and other creatures are sometimes swept up in the cyclone as well, where they remain trapped until a planar rift appears and they can escape through it. Even if the rift closes, the cyclone remains.

A creature caught in the cyclone is trapped there and takes 14 (4d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature that has a flying speed can escape the cyclone by flying into the rift; a creature without a flying speed can use an action to try to harness the winds of the cyclone, propelling itself through the rift with a successful DC 19 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check.

##### Climbing the Chasm Walls

The chasm's walls are honeycombed with niches, each no more than 5 feet wide and 10 feet deep, set between stucco statues of people bearing expressions of horror and pain. A character can climb a section of wall without magic or climbing gear by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A failed check indicates that no progress is made; if a check fails by 5 or more, the character slips and plunges to the cavern floor, taking damage from the fall as normal.

##### Bodies of the Fallen

Lying in a heap on the chasm floor directly below the shaft that leads to area R1 are a dozen corpses. These are the remains of people who fell to their doom. Most are clad in the chitinous armor of the Aurora Watch. Two of the bodies look more recently deceased and wear the blue garb of the Cobalt Soul; these are the unlucky allies of Question the tiefling.

##### Treasure

A character who inspects the remains of the two Cobalt Soul explorers finds a [cloak of protection](/compendium/items/cloak-of-protection.md) and a [cracked driftglobe](/compendium/items/cracked-driftglobe-cm.md). In its damaged state, the [driftglobe](/compendium/items/cracked-driftglobe-cm.md) can be used only to cast the [light](/compendium/spells/light.md) spell.

#### R16: Prayer Site of Avandra

The only way to access this chamber is by going through the doors in the statue in area R12. When the characters follow the passageway inside the statue, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The passage defies reality, distorting any sense of direction as it twists and turns, making its way through the earth to another place deep inside the Betrayers' Rise. The passage ends on the east side of a circular chamber. Its walls are covered with softly glowing amber-colored crystals that fill a crater at the room's center. At the bottom of the crater sits an altar made of the same crystal.
^167

This location is the prayer site where Avandra saved Alyxian from death and granted him the ability to stand against the Betrayer Gods. The crater is roughly 30 feet deep. At its base is a cleared area about 10 feet in diameter. A creature can climb down the crater's crystal slope with a successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a failed check, the creature slips and tumbles to the bottom, taking 10 (3d6) slashing damage from the sharp crystals.

##### Curse of the Crawling King

Creatures that were affected by the curse of Torog in area R12 can rid themselves of the curse by entering this area. If any of the characters were cursed when they arrived here, describe the end of the effect as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Your incessant urge to kill is gone, replaced by a torrent of noise that coalesces into a threatening scream.
> 
> "Change Bringer! Your luck shall not hold!"
> 
> The voice echoes in your mind and then becomes silent. The sheltering embrace of Avandra's lingering presence has dispelled the curse of the Crawling King.
^169

##### The Jewel Awakens

If a character who has the Jewel of Three Prayers reaches the bottom of the crater, the jewel tugs the character in the direction of the altar, as if it wants to be placed there. If the jewel is placed on the altar, all the characters in this chamber experience the following vision:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A spectral figure blossoms forth from the amulet. This warrior, who called himself Alyxian in your previous vision, looks up at you with a faint smile and says, "You came... you followed... you can find me." The crystals around you glow brightly, and your vision goes white. Then you see a company of armored soldiers, Alyxian among them, marching into the Betrayers' Rise. Their expressions are grim. Though they do not speak, you can tell that none of them expects to come home.
> 
> The vision shifts again, and everyone in the company of soldiers is dead except for Alyxian, who continues to fight while surrounded by the corpses of mortals and demons. He is hurled across the battlefield by the claws of a gorilla-like demon. The scene blurs, and he falls to his knees, pleading, before a simple wooden altar that bears the holy symbol of Avandra. At the end of his prayer, he's lifted to his feet by a tall young woman with light brown skin and flowing black hair.
> 
> A foreboding voice cuts through this scene of divine intervention, and Alyxian freezes. "The Change Bringer and a mortal," the voice intones. "What brings you into my sacred, devouring darkness? Even if you save him, Change Bringer, he will suffer. He will die. He will be forgotten. All that he has worked to save will crumble and be devoured by worms. Why invite further suffering? Let go. Give in. All is futile in the end, so why..."
> 
> As the voice trails off, Alyxian turns to face you and falls to his knees in tears. The scenery shifts, and the forsaken warrior is now underwater, amid the ruins of a sunken city. "The Crawling King spoke true," he mutters. "All was futile. All has been forgotten... and I am lost in darkness. Please, help me set it right."

The final scene of the vision takes place in the Drowned City of Cael Morrow; recalling the appearance of this location will help the characters as they seek more information about the Apotheon in chapter 4.

The vision persists long enough for the characters to speak to Alyxian for a few moments. Once the characters have had three questions answered, the vision ends as new arrivals come on the scene (see "Confrontation for the Jewel" below). Alyxian addresses the characters' questions with the following information:

- Alyxian was born in the lands of Wildemount under full Ruidus, which cursed him to endure a life of suffering. He decided to spend his life shielding others from pain, since he was already doomed to suffer.
- He fought in the Calamity and was called the Apotheon because he beseeched the gods for power three times and three times received it—first on the shores of Wildemount, again in the depths of the Betrayers' Rise, and once more in a temple of Corellon the Arch Heart in a city of elves and orcs in the jungles of Marquet. These divine gifts transformed him from a mortal being into something more. Alyxian says that the city of elves and orcs was destroyed centuries ago. (This is partly true; the city Alyxian speaks of is now the underwater ruin called Cael Morrow, described in chapter 5.)
- Alyxian is imprisoned in an underwater place lit by a crimson glow. He grows angry as he explains that mortals are harvesting the source of the glow and leaving him in darkness, and that this act is torture for him. (This is both true and an indication of the Apotheon's emotional state; his fury is simmering beneath his sorrowful demeanor.)

Alyxian answers other questions as well as he can, drawing from information in the "Story Overview" section of the introduction. He portrays himself as sympathetic and helpless.

The next time the characters look at the Jewel of Three Prayers, they find it has transformed into its [Awakened State](/compendium/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-awakened-crcotn.md) (as described in appendix B). The transformed jewel can be removed from the altar safely.

### Confrontation for the Jewel

The following boxed text assumes that [Aloysia Telfan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aloysia-telfan-crcotn.md) is still alive; if that's not the case, replace Aloysia with another [occult initiate](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-initiate-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) from the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Just as the vision of Alyxian fades, you become aware of the presence of intruders. Your rivals appear at the edge of the crater, along with a red-robed figure. "Well done, heroes!" says [Aloysia Telfan](/compendium/bestiary/npc/aloysia-telfan-crcotn.md). "Now, if you would simply hand over the jewel, we can all get out of here without spilling any more blood."
^16d

Aloysia and the rivals did not use the same route as the characters to reach area R16. They were transported to the crater's edge by a magical force they encountered in their version of the Betrayers' Rise.

Aloysia is determined to claim the Jewel of Three Prayers. The rival adventurers stand arrayed behind her with their hands on their weapons.

If characters refuse to surrender the jewel, Aloysia orders the rivals to kill them and take the jewel by force.

Before running this encounter, consider who among the rivals is friendly, indifferent, or hostile toward the characters. The rivals' overall attitude determines how they respond to Aloysia's order, and if there is a tie, Ayo Jabe's opinion breaks it:

- **Friendly Rivals..** Ayo Jabe congratulates the characters for reaching the prayer site and awakening the Jewel of Three Prayers. The rivals not only allow the characters to keep the jewel but also offer to help them return to Bazzoxan. Aloysia is shocked by the rivals' betrayal.
- **Indifferent Rivals..** The rivals try to knock the characters [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious), take the jewel, and give it to Aloysia.
- **Hostile Rivals..** Ayo strides to the edge of the crater and snarls, "I guess this is the end of your hunt, huh?" The rivals attack with intent to kill.

#### Aloysia's Next Move

Aloysia carries a satchel that holds three [teleportation tablets](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) (see appendix B), all connected to the same teleportation circle in Ank'Harel (see chapter 4). Her next actions are determined by who winds up with the Jewel of Three Prayers.

##### Aloysia Gets the Jewel

If Aloysia gets the jewel, she uses a [teleportation tablet](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) to transport herself to Ank'Harel. She invites the rivals to follow her, assuming they didn't betray her; any creature that enters the circle before the start of Aloysia's next turn is also teleported.

##### Aloysia Doesn't Get the Jewel

If the characters retain possession of the jewel, Aloysia loses her temper and begins ranting on her next turn. Midway through her rant, she pulls a scroll from her belt. The scroll is a spell scroll of [earthquake](/compendium/spells/earthquake.md), which she casts (choosing the Structures option) as an action on her turn. Aloysia then flees up the passageway, accidentally dropping two [teleportation tablets](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) while she rummages through her satchel. A huge chunk of stone falls from the ceiling behind her, separating her from the characters and blocking their only exit. On her next turn, she uses her third and final [teleportation tablet](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) to escape to Ank'Harel.

Each creature in the prayer site when Aloysia casts [earthquake](/compendium/spells/earthquake.md) must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage from falling rubble on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The boulder that seals off the prayer site can be cleared if creatures with a combined Strength of 70 or higher spend a total of 10 hours working to move it, or if creatures with a combined Strength score of 50 or higher spend a total of 20 hours working to move it.

## Next Steps

The characters' choices at the end of this chapter determine which allies and enemies await their arrival in Ank'Harel.

If the rivals took the Jewel of Three Prayers, or if Aloysia fled to Ank'Harel on her own, the characters can use Aloysia's [teleportation tablets](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) to travel to Ank'Harel directly, without backtracking or spending more time in Bazzoxan. Otherwise, they can find their way out of the Betrayers' Rise, return to Bazzoxan, and plan their next move with or without the help of the following nonplayer characters:

- **Prolix Yusaf..** Prolix has his own [teleportation tablet](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md), which he can use to teleport himself, the characters, and Question the tiefling (see below) to Ank'Harel. Prolix offers to introduce the characters to his peers in the Allegiance of Allsight, who can help the characters learn more about the Apotheon and the Jewel of Three Prayers.
- **Question..** If the characters tell Question what happened in the prayer site of Avandra, she is happy to learn what they discovered but sad to hear that her Cobalt Soul colleagues were lost. That news makes her determined to ensure that her colleagues' deaths were not in vain. She tells the characters that her organization could use people of their skills and invites them to Ank'Harel to report their findings to the monks of the Cobalt Soul. She says she has made plans with [Prolix Yusaf](/compendium/bestiary/npc/prolix-yusaf-crcotn.md) to return to Ank'Harel together if the Library of the Cobalt Soul's expedition was lost.
- **Taskhand Verin Thelyss..** If the characters report to Verin, he is eager to hear about their experiences in the Betrayers' Rise. If they show him one of Aloysia's [teleportation tablets](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md), Verin has a mage of the Aurora Watch cast [identify](/compendium/spells/identify.md) on the item. The mage says that the tablet is linked to a teleportation circle on the continent of Marquet. Verin encourages the characters to travel there, telling them that he believes their fates are somehow intertwined with "divine forces that can't be ignored." He bids them farewell and looks forward to seeing them again, after their adventure has concluded.
