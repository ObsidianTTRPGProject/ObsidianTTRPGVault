# Chapter 5: The Drowned City
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep* 

Cael Morrow lies in a flooded cavern deep beneath the foundations of Ank'Harel. Only ruins of the place remain, but even so there is no doubt that Cael Morrow was one of the most magnificent cities in the world before the Calamity. (The city's original name is unknown; "Cael Morrow" is the name given to the place by the archaeologists of the Allegiance of Allsight.) In those days, it was home to elves of all kinds—including those who were transformed into Exandria's first orcs by the blood of Gruumsh the Ruiner after Corellon pierced his eye on the field of battle. The city was a bastion of hope, its magical wards blessed by the Arch Heart.

Infuriated by his loss to Corellon, Gruumsh swore to annihilate Cael Morrow. The Betrayer stood more than a hundred feet tall, looming over a temple to Corellon in the center of the city. There, he raised his terrible spear, intending to strike the earth with such force that all of Marquet would be reduced to ash—only to have his blow parried by Alyxian the Apotheon at the last second.

Cael Morrow, the Drowned City, is the grave of thousands of Gruumsh's victims. Even Alyxian's sacrifice, which protected much of the land of Marquet at the cost of his freedom, could not save the city. Now, the center of Cael Morrow is a planar rift born from the place where Gruumsh's spear struck the earth. This rift is the gateway to the Netherdeep, the fountainhead of the corrupting element ruidium, and an object of fascination to Ank'Harel's factions. The rift will draw the characters and their rivals into conflict once more—with the chance to become heroes.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter contains a description of the ruins of Cael Morrow, which the characters explore over the course of the various faction missions detailed in the previous chapter. These missions, which differ depending on which faction the characters have allied themselves with, form the story of this chapter. The missions aren't necessary for advancing the adventure plot; if the characters want to save Alyxian and enter the Netherdeep, they can do so without the prompting of their faction. But if they need a push to enter the Netherdeep, the missions in chapter 4 can help motivate them.

### Rival Developments

Like the characters, the rivals entered Cael Morrow on behalf of their faction. But the treacherous ruins and horrific creatures have taken their toll on the group.

When the characters encounter their rivals in Cael Morrow, it might be the first time they've met since Bazzoxan. In the meantime, the rivals have been working with an opposing faction, exploring Cael Morrow and the Netherdeep in their own way—and facing the eerie beings within.

By the time the characters meet them again in Cael Morrow, the rivals have changed dramatically. They now use their tier 3 stat blocks (see appendix A). The changes the rivals have undergone are as follows:

[Ayo Jabe](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ayo-jabe-tier-3-crcotn.md). Ayo's drive to prove herself a hero, and to prove herself superior to the characters, has brought her to this place. She is aware of the trauma that her quest has put her friends through. This feeling has led her to doubt her leadership abilities. Ayo is filled with cold fury toward anything that stands in her way, including her own insecurities.

[Dermot Wurder](/compendium/bestiary/npc/dermot-wurder-tier-3-crcotn.md). Dermot's desire to protect his friends is still at the core of his being. But dozens of battles and near-death experiences have turned his uncertainty into steely confidence.

[Galsariad Ardyth](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galsariad-ardyth-tier-3-crcotn.md). Galsariad's haughtiness has drained from his heart—as have all his other emotions. He has witnessed unspeakable horrors in the name of gaining greater magical power and has protected himself from being overcome by fear and self-loathing by suppressing all his feelings.

[Irvan Wastewalker](/compendium/bestiary/npc/irvan-wastewalker-tier-3-crcotn.md). Irvan's cavalier demeanor disappeared when he lost his arm in a battle with a slithering bloodfin in Cael Morrow. His faction allies fitted him with a stylish and functional arcane prosthetic, but this brush with death has made him short-tempered, cautious, and mistrustful. Irvan fears that any further mistake could cost him his life—permanently.

[Maggie Keeneyes](/compendium/bestiary/npc/maggie-keeneyes-tier-3-crcotn.md). A deep melancholy has taken root in Maggie's heart. She continues the mission out of love for Ayo, but she fears that her leader's determination might not be enough to achieve victory. Maggie doesn't trust the Allegiance of Allsight agents in Cael Morrow (even if the rivals have allied with that faction), believing them to be influenced by a malevolent force. She has shared her misgivings about this organization with Ayo on several occasions.

#### Encountering the Rivals

The rivals have become affiliated with a faction of your choice, most likely the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream. Their reason for joining their faction and coming into conflict with the characters depends on how the characters have interacted with them so far:

- **Friendly Rivals..** Rivals who are friendly toward the characters are happy for the groups to work together.
- **Indifferent Rivals..** If the rivals are indifferent to the characters, then this competition is nothing personal—it's just business, and they happen to be on different sides. If they are working for the same faction, the rivals are willing to cooperate, but they make it clear they intend to come out on top and be considered the real heroes.
- **Hostile Rivals..** Rivals who are hostile toward the characters hold a grudge against them and aim to prove their superiority.

A good time for the characters to encounter the rivals is when the characters try to leave Cael Morrow with something valuable in their possession, such as the Key to the Netherdeep (see the faction story tracks in chapter 4) or the Jewel of Three Prayers in its [Exalted State](/compendium/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-exalted-crcotn.md) (see area M9).

If the characters get the better of the rivals in this chapter, you can use the rivals' defeat to change the pace of the exploration of the Netherdeep in the next chapter. The rivals could take a few days to lick their wounds and prepare for the next encounter with the characters. Or the rivals' defeat could reenergize them, prompting them to try to get a head start on exploring the Netherdeep.

> Cael Morrow is currently under the jurisdiction of the Allegiance of Allsight, whose members wear badges inside their robes. (For more information on these badges and how the characters can obtain them, see chapter 4.) Interlopers who don't show their official badge when asked are attacked on sight. Allegiance agents try to apprehend intruders by knocking them [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) and then take them to Professor [Insight Acuere](/compendium/bestiary/npc/insight-acuere-crcotn.md) (see area M3) for questioning.

## Cael Morrow Overview

Rare are the things that remain beautiful after their deaths—Cael Morrow is one of them. Through the efforts of the Allegiance of Allsight, portions of the sunken city have been reclaimed and magically warded against the pervasive deluge. In the last few months, the faction has done its best to reinforce the city's eroding architecture, securing the place for the sake of the faction's archaeological pursuits.

Despite these efforts, though, Cael Morrow remains a largely inhospitable place. Otherworldly aquatic creatures thrive in the ruins, some adapted to and warped by the impenetrable darkness and others aberrant growths spawned in the Netherdeep. To make matters worse, the spirits of the dead and the damned from the Calamity long ago still haunt the wreckage of the city.

### Features of Cael Morrow

The areas of the Drowned City, depicted on the map of Cael Morrow, have the features described below.

#### Architecture

Unless otherwise noted, the areas in Cael Morrow have 30-foot-high ceilings, and the ceilings in the connecting hallways are 20 feet high. Doorways are 8 feet high and 3 feet wide.

#### Flooded Cavern

The cavern that contains the sunken city is 500 feet below ground and filled with fresh water that flows out of the Netherdeep rift (area M17). The water bubbles up to Ank'Harel through a narrow, natural channel in the roof of the cavern (not shown on the map).

The characters first enter the flooded cavern by descending the hollow interior of a natural stone column (area M1) that stretches from the top of the cavern to the bottom.

#### Light

Unless otherwise noted, all keyed locations on the map are lit by [continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md) spells. The only areas not illuminated in this way are places where the Allegiance of Allsight hasn't yet erected protective wards (described below).

#### Magical Barriers and Keystones

The Allegiance of Allsight has constructed 1-inch-thick magical barriers of shimmering, light blue force around certain areas of Cael Morrow, as indicated on the map. These wards have forced the water out of those areas, leaving behind dry, air-filled chambers and hallways. The rest of the Drowned City is underwater.

The barriers are soundproof, and their edges overlap with walls, doors, ceilings, and floors without harming those features. In places where a barrier overlaps with a stone wall, door, ceiling, or floor, it is [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) and untouchable.

Any ward that encloses an area also creates a barrier across the doorways leading to and from that area. These barriers function as airlocks.

A barrier is immune to all damage, is impermeable to liquids, and can't be dispelled. A creature can pass through a barrier, in either direction, by spending 5 feet of movement, but no creature can be pushed or pulled through by another one. As a creature passes through a barrier, it experiences a harmless tingling sensation.

Each warded area has a keystone located somewhere in it. For example, a keystone might be inserted into the top of a door frame or set into the floor. A keystone is a cube of solid gray stone measuring 6 inches on a side, each side inscribed with arcane runes that emit the same blue light as the barriers. A keystone has AC 17, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying an area's keystone, removing a keystone from the area it affects, or targeting a keystone with a [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell causes the barrier around that area to dissipate. If that happens, each creature in the area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one, as the area fills with water.

### The Alyxian Aboleth

Lurking in the waters of Cael Morrow is an aboleth that believes it is the physical embodiment of the Apotheon. It uses the [Alyxian Aboleth](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/alyxian-aboleth-crcotn.md) stat block in appendix A.

#### Where Is the Aboleth?

The aboleth's lair is in Cael Morrow's kelp forest (area M11). The creature routinely swims about in the ruins, striking fear into those who are delving into the remains of the city. If the Alyxian Aboleth is reduced to half its hit points or fewer, it retreats to its lair and tries to take an uninterrupted short rest, regaining 9d10 + 36 hit points at the end of it.

To determine the aboleth's whereabouts while the characters explore Cael Morrow, roll a d20 and consult the Aboleth's Location table, or choose one of the suggested locations. The aboleth has free access to all the submerged map locations. It's recommended that you determine a new location for the aboleth whenever the characters move from one area to another, though the creature can move less frequently if you see fit.

**Aboleth's Location**

| dice: d20 | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| 1–10 | Brooding in its lair in area M11 |
| 11–15 | Searching area M8 for archaeologists to devour |
| 16–20 | Patrolling the rift in area M17 |
^aboleths-location

#### Poisoned Emotions

The aboleth's psychic powers have been amplified by the ruidium that pervades its flesh.

The first time the characters enter each of several keyed locations (areas M2, M4, M5a, M7c, M8, M10, and M15), the aboleth transmits a telepathic message to one randomly determined character, who hears the aboleth's voice—a distorted version of the true voice of Alyxian that they've heard in their visions—echo in their mind. Roll on the Poisoned Emotions table to determine the aboleth's message. After receiving the message, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the message's corresponding effect, as noted in the table. A character can repeat the saving throw after finishing a short or long rest, ending the effect on themself on a success. The effect can also be removed from a character by any magic that ends a curse.

The aboleth loses this ability when the consciousness of the Apotheon manifests in the Temple of Corellon (see "Second Vision" in area M9), and any creatures currently affected by it feel its effects end immediately.

**Poisoned Emotions**

| dice: d10 | Message | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1–2 | "Ungrateful wretches—they have forgotten all I have done!" | The character has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws. |
| 3–4 | "My power was not enough. It never will be." | The character has disadvantage on attack rolls. |
| 5–6 | "Why have the gods forsaken me?" | The character has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws. |
| 7–8 | "They were right. I bring nothing but despair." | The character has disadvantage on Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws. |
| 9–10 | "If I can't live, I will burn this world with me." | Whenever the character hits a creature with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage, and the character also takes 1d6 psychic damage. |
^poisoned-emotions

### Uncharted Waters

Many areas of Cael Morrow have yet to be secured by the Allegiance of Allsight. Exploring areas unprotected by magical wards is a dangerous proposition, with hungry sea creatures liable to be lurking around any corner. When the characters enter an area of Cael Morrow not protected by a ward, roll on the Cael Morrow Encounters table to determine what they face. Don't roll on this table if hostile creatures are already in the area.

Cael Morrow includes many other areas beyond what this book describes. You can use the encounters from this table to populate other parts of the sunken city for the party to explore.

**Cael Morrow Encounters**

| dice: d12 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | A [swarm of sorrowfish](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/swarm-of-sorrowfish-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) flocks around the detritus of a shark's corpse, ravenous for more prey. |
| 2 | Three [scuttling serpentmaws](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/scuttling-serpentmaw-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) search for food. |
| 3 | A [giant octopus](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-octopus.md) wrestles with a locked chest. The chest contains 1,000 ep in coins minted long ago in Cael Morrow. |
| 4 | Tentacles burst from the darkness as a [death embrace](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/death-embrace-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) notices the characters. |
| 5 | Two [slithering bloodfins](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/slithering-bloodfin-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) streak through the water, eager for a meal. |
| 6 | Two [aboleth spawn](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/aboleth-spawn-crcotn.md) (see their stat block later in the chapter) spot the characters and flee to alert the Alyxian Aboleth, which appears 1 minute later. |
| 7–12 | No encounter occurs. |
^cael-morrow-encounters

### Cael Morrow Locations (M1-M8)

The locations described below are keyed to the Cael Morrow map. This map doesn't show the sunken city in its entirety, just the areas important to the adventure. You can expand Cael Morrow by adding locations and encounters of your own design.

#### M1: Stone Column

A 10-foot-wide spiral staircase descends along the interior of a hollow stone column that extends down from the Maw of Cael Morrow in Ank'Harel's Sigil District (described in chapter 4).

Read or paraphrase the following when the characters reach the bottom of the column for the first time:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You descend a spiral staircase for hundreds of feet. Windows in the nearby wall offer glimpses of a sunken city below Ank'Harel. Magical lights illuminate several of its ruins, but most of the city is hidden from view.
> 
> At the bottom of the staircase is a plain, windowless room containing boxes of archaeological tools and crates marked with the emblem of the Allegiance of Allsight. Not far away is a passage that leads to a stone door also marked with the Allegiance's symbol. Leaning against the wall next to the door is an orc wearing the badge of an Allegiance of Allsight member. He doesn't seem to have noticed you.
^286

The person near the door is a sullen, lawful neutral orc named Gortag Inkdrinker (use the [scholarly agent](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-agent-crcotn.md) stat block in appendix A). The characters can surprise him if they act quickly. If the characters are members of the Allegiance of Allsight or the Library of the Cobalt Soul, Gortag treats them as allies and invites them to meet with his superior, Professor [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) Acuere, in the Allegiance base camp (area M3). If the characters accept the invitation, he escorts them there.

If one or more characters aren't wearing Allegiance badges or claim to be in league with the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream, Gortag tells them to halt and return up the stairs and does his best to hinder their progress without provoking conflict. If combat breaks out, he opens the door he's guarding, pushes himself through the magical barrier that extends across the doorway (see "Features of Cael Morrow" earlier in the chapter), and alerts the guards in area M2. If he's successful, he runs to area M3 to warn [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) that enemies have entered the Drowned City. If Gortag is unable to flee, he throws himself on the characters' mercy and can be persuaded to lead the party past the guards in area M2, if only to avoid harm.

##### Crates

The crates contain recovered relics and specimens in glass jars, all packed for transport.

#### M2: Warded Entrance Hall

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A corridor framed by shimmering blue light extends ahead of you. This airtight tunnel ends before a door set into the wall of a submerged building. Above the doorway is a small stone cube inscribed with glowing blue symbols. Standing in front of the door are two guards, a human and a halfling, wearing Allegiance of Allsight apparel and badges. Verdant patches of kelp grow just outside the tunnel's shimmering walls, and colorful fish flit between the swaying strands.
^289

The first time the characters enter this area, one among them (determined randomly) receives a telepathic message from the Alyxian Aboleth (see "Poisoned Emotions" earlier in the chapter).

This hall is composed entirely of magical barriers created by the keystone placed above the doorway to area M3. See the "Features of Cael Morrow" section for more information.

Two [scholarly agents](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-agent-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) stand outside the door to area M3. One is a lawful neutral human named Kal, and the other is a lawful good halfling named Nadiya.

These guards have dealt with raiders and infiltrators before. They are hostile to anyone who tries to get past them without a badge. If the characters are members of the Allegiance of Allsight or are accompanied by Gortag, the two guards let the group through with minimal questioning. If they believe the characters to be lying, the guards turn hostile and attack.

##### Keystone

The stone cube above the door to area M3 is a keystone (see "Features of Cael Morrow" earlier in the chapter). Destroying the keystone or removing it from this area causes the magical barriers that enclose area M2 to disappear. When that happens, all creatures in the corridor are engulfed by water. The barriers around area M3 remain intact.

#### M3: Allegiance Base Camp

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This storage building has three floors connected by a spiral staircase. The archaeologists are using the shelf space to store journals, recovered relics, and excavation equipment. Windows warded by barriers of shimmering blue light offer views of the underwater cavern outside this structure.
> 
> Three individuals wearing Allegiance of Allsight garb and badges—a tiefling, a goliath, and a kenku—bustle about the space, engrossed in their work.
^28c

The Allegiance's base of operations in the ruins is maintained by an adjunct professor of archaeology named [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) Acuere, a lawful good tiefling. Most of her team has been recalled to the Crystal Chateau, but she still has two research technicians helping her: the laconic [Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md), a chaotic neutral kenku, and the rambunctious [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md), a neutral good goliath (see the "Goliaths of Exandria" sidebar in chapter 4). See below for their statistics and roleplaying information.

Nearly inseparable, [Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md) and [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) have been working together at the camp for months. They complement each other as friends and scholars. [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) tends to talk ceaselessly about her latest discoveries, and [Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md) patiently listens, absorbing many of [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md)'s excited ramblings into his own speech.

If [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight), [Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md), and [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) become hostile toward intruders, they fight to kill. On the first turn of combat, [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) uses a [sending stone](/compendium/items/sending-stone-ai.md) to contact Headmaster Cryon in the Crystal Chateau and request aid. Twenty minutes later, ten [scholarly agents](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-agent-crcotn.md) and five [scholarly excavators](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-excavator-crcotn.md) (see appendix A for both stat blocks) arrive by way of area M1 to secure the base camp.

##### Insight Acuere

The [tiefling professor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/insight-acuere-crcotn.md) uses the [scholarly mastermind](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-mastermind-crcotn.md) stat block (see appendix A), with these changes:

- The professor speaks Aquan, Common, Infernal, and Orc.
- She has resistance to fire damage and [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.

[Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) won't cooperate with the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream unless she is tricked or magically compelled into doing so. If the characters are members of the Allegiance of Allsight, [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) informs them that they have arrived earlier than she expected, but she's nonetheless happy to see them. If they're allied with the Cobalt Soul, she requires them to prove their usefulness before she reveals any information (see "Insight's Quest" in mission 4 of the Cobalt Soul Story Track in chapter 4).

[Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) is the primary archivist for the Cael Morrow archaeological project and would put her life on the line to ensure its success. She is willing to share the results of her research with fellow Allegiance members. [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) can offer the following information in response to the characters' questions:

- The wards keeping the water at bay are magically generated by keystones in each warded location. These keystones look like small stone cubes with glowing runes carved into their sides. Removing a keystone from the area it protects causes the barriers around that location to vanish, allowing the water in.
- The wards that have been erected end at an ancient temple to Corellon the Arch Heart, which seems to have its own magical way of holding back the water. Allegiance members have yet to breach the temple's ward.
- A fourth member of the expedition, [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)'s friend [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md), a high elf professor of ancient literature, hasn't been seen in three days. [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) is concerned but hasn't yet considered raising a search party because [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) has a shield guardian to protect her.

##### Scribble

[Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md) uses the [scholarly agent](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-agent-crcotn.md) stat block (see appendix A), with this change:

- [Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md) understands Auran and Common but speaks only through mimicry. He can imitate any sounds he has heard, including voices.

[Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md) seems pleasant enough, but a character who spends more than 10 minutes with him can tell that the kenku is haunted. While scouring Cael Morrow for relics, he received telepathic threats from the Alyxian Aboleth but lacks the vocabulary to convey the horror of that experience; however, he can repeat any of the phrases listed on the Poisoned Emotions table.

##### Xot

This goliath uses the [scholarly excavator](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scholarly-excavator-crcotn.md) stat block (see appendix A), with these changes:

- [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) speaks Common and Giant.
- She has resistance to cold damage and counts as one size larger when determining her carrying capacity and the weight she can push, drag, or lift.

If the characters are members of the Allegiance of Allsight or if they succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) shows them the items she and [Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md) have stored on the second floor of the building. She explains that these objects were deemed too damaged or insignificant to warrant their transport topside, but she found them too charming to discard entirely.

[Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md)'s collection consists of ancient baubles, rusted spear heads, and worthless bits of jewelry—but a character who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a [ring of the ram](/compendium/items/ring-of-the-ram.md) and a sludgy but still potent [potion of healing (superior)](/compendium/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md). [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) can be convinced to give up these two items from her collection by a character who makes a successful DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

##### Double Agent

Characters who are following the Allegiance Story Track might come to Cael Morrow hoping to expose a double agent in the expedition. A character who speaks with [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) Acuere, [Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md), or [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check to get a sense of that person's loyalty. On a successful check, it's apparent to the character that the individual is fully dedicated to the expedition and doesn't have any intention of betraying their faction.

##### Exploring the Building

The map of Cael Morrow shows only the first floor of area M3, but the upper two floors have a similar floor plan. The floors are described below.

- **First and Second Floors..** These floors have shelves holding organic and mineral specimens taken from Cael Morrow. Characters interested in Exandrian history might find several clay tablets, sound-storing magic crystals, and water-damaged vellum manuscripts containing accounts and images of daily life in the city before the events of the Calamity that brought it to ruin. Tucked among the specimens is a selection of baubles that [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) has hoarded.
- **Third Floor..** Allegiance members come up here to rest. Large holes in the roof are covered by magical barriers of blue force, thanks to a keystone hidden on this floor (see "Keystone" below). This former attic holds six small crates of preserved food, a dozen casks of fresh water, six cots with soft pillows and blankets, and an unlocked wooden case containing two [breathing bubbles](/compendium/items/breathing-bubble-egw.md) (see appendix B) with full air supplies and three [potions of water breathing](/compendium/items/potion-of-water-breathing.md). [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) and her companions won't permit the theft of these items, but [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) is willing to share them with the characters if they request her aid and their goals align with hers.

##### Keystone

The keystone that keeps the water out of this building and the L-shaped corridor linking it to area M4 (see "Features of Cael Morrow" earlier in the chapter) is hidden in a wall on the building's third floor behind a loose stone. [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight), [Scribble](/compendium/bestiary/npc/scribble-crcotn.md), and [Xot](/compendium/bestiary/npc/xot-crcotn.md) know where the keystone is, but they won't divulge its location to others if doing so might endanger them or any other Allegiance members.

It takes 10 minutes for a character to thoroughly search the third floor. At the end of that time, the character can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, finding the keystone on a successful check. If the keystone is destroyed or removed from this area, water comes gushing in through the rooftop. In addition, the barriers that form the corridor to M4 disappear, engulfing the corridor's occupants in water.

#### M4: Royal Guest House

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Before you are the ruins of a once-magnificent house of white stone. The ceiling has fallen through, leaving the marble floors littered with masonry, broken bed frames, and other furniture from at least three collapsed stories. A staircase leads from the entrance hall to the upper level of the main room. Walls of blue light hold back the water on all sides, leaving the interior dry.
^294

The first time the characters enter this area, one among them (determined randomly) receives a telepathic message from the Alyxian Aboleth (see "Poisoned Emotions" earlier in the chapter).

Long ago this building was a guest house for royal visitors to Cael Morrow. Now it is an empty husk, mostly picked clean of valuables by the researchers of the Allegiance of Allsight. The keystone for the wards in this location (see "Features of Cael Morrow" earlier in the chapter) is above the north door.

#### M4a: Parlor

This roofless chamber is filled with rubble from the collapsed upper floors and the staircase that once led up to them.

#### M4b: Private Study

This ruined study is filled with enormous chunks of fallen masonry.

##### Treasure

Any character who spends 10 minutes searching through the rubble can make a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a successful check, the character finds a spell scroll of [teleport](/compendium/spells/teleport.md). Only one such scroll can be found here.

#### M5: Access Corridor

This corridor of shimmering blue barriers intersects with the remains of a guard tower (area M5a), which is enclosed by barriers as well. The keystone that maintains the barriers is set into the floor of the tower. See the "Features of Cael Morrow" section for more information on the magical barriers and keystones.

As they traverse this hall, the characters can see a deep reddish glow to the east (emanating from the ruidium spines in area M17).

#### M5a: Crumbling Guard Tower

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Cold water drips from above as the wards surrounding this ruined tower flicker. Resting in a shallow indentation in the middle of the floor is a stone cube six inches on a side that hisses and sparks.
^29a

The first time the characters enter this area, one among them (determined randomly) receives a telepathic message from the Alyxian Aboleth (see "Poisoned Emotions" earlier in the chapter).

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher notice the silhouette of a giant shark circling the tower. As long as the barriers remain in place, the shark doesn't pose a threat.

##### Malfunctioning Keystone

Any character who examines the keystone closely and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check determines that its magic is weakening, but there's no way to tell when it will cease to function. The Allegiance of Allsight explorers in Cael Morrow are unaware of the problem, since the keystone began to malfunction only recently.

It's only a matter of time before the faulty keystone fails, causing the barriers around the tower and the barriers that protect the adjoining hallways to disappear. Removing the keystone from the floor also causes this to happen. In its defective state, this cube has 25 hit points instead of the normal 50.

If the characters leave the keystone undisturbed, they can pass through the tower safely and continue onward. If any of them return to the tower a second time, the keystone makes a loud popping noise in their presence and cracks in half, bringing down the magical barriers. The shark, which is a [corrupted giant shark](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/corrupted-giant-shark-crcotn.md) (see appendix A), attacks characters who now find themselves underwater.

#### M6: Sunken Tavern

This stone-walled tavern is underwater. Sections of its exterior walls have collapsed, leaving openings through which the interior can be seen:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Cracked stone tiles and fields of kelp surround a submerged building with light emanating from its interior. Through a hole in one wall, you see a blue-skinned elf with long, white hair. It's hard to see exactly what she's doing from this viewpoint, but she appears to be tending bar.
^29d

[Continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md) spells illuminate the interior of this underwater tavern, which is strewn with detritus. A neutral good sea elf named [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) floats behind a granite countertop. If approached, the barkeep cheerfully introduces herself and welcomes the characters to what she calls the Last Willow Tavern. [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) uses the [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) stat block, with these changes:

- She has a swimming speed equal to her walking speed, and she can breathe air and water.
- She has [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.
- She has resistance to cold damage and advantage on saving throws to end the [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition on herself. Magic can't put her to sleep.

[Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) speaks an ancient dialect that formed the basis for both Elvish and Orc, and any character who speaks and understands either of those languages can converse with her. This is a trait she shares with some of the ghosts of her kinfolk that still haunt the ruins of Cael Morrow, but [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) is no ghost; she is one of the few mortals who survived Gruumsh's attack centuries ago. She subsists on the kelp growing throughout the Drowned City.

Decades spent near the Netherdeep and the Alyxian Aboleth have damaged [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md)'s memories. A few of the Allegiance of Allsight archaeologists have interacted with [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md), to no avail, and since she shows no sign of hostility toward their efforts, they have decided to leave her alone.

##### Buying Goods from Olara

[Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) treats the characters as she would patrons of her tavern in any normal setting, commenting on the fact that, though the tavern is out of food and spirits, she can still offer some special brews. If the characters humor her, [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) shows off her collection of mundane wines and magic potions—their containers all tightly sealed. Characters can purchase any of these items:

- **Magically Preserved Wine..** [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) has three bottles of this delicious, pre-Divergence vintage in stock and asks 50 gp per bottle. An Ank'Hareli sommelier will pay up to 1,000 gp for a bottle of this rare vintage.
- **Potions of Healing..** [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) has five of [potions of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md) in stock and sells them for 50 gp each.
- **Potions of Heroism..** [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) has two [potions of heroism](/compendium/items/potion-of-heroism.md) in stock and sells them for 300 gp each.

##### Clearing Olara's Mind

The haze that clouds [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md)'s mind is magically induced, a result of many years spent near the Alyxian Aboleth and the Netherdeep. Any magic that ends a curse cures [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md)'s affliction. Killing the aboleth also ends the effect.

If the characters ask [Olara](/compendium/bestiary/npc/olara-crcotn.md) about Alyxian after clearing her mind, she fondly recalls serving wine to him on one occasion. She remembers Alyxian as a haunted and tragic figure, but beautiful in a way.

#### M7: Hall of the Royal Library

A dry, air-filled hallway enclosed by magical barriers and illuminated by [continual flame](/compendium/spells/continual-flame.md) spells runs along the south side of a crumbling stone building. The keystone that maintains the hallway's barriers is set above the western door. See the "Features of Cael Morrow" section for more information on the magical barriers and keystones.

A door in the north wall of the corridor leads to a dry, air-filled library (area M7a). A door in the south wall has a flooded chamber (area M8) beyond it, with a protective barrier across the doorway that holds back the water. A door at the east end of the hallway has a similar barrier, through which characters can see the Temple of the Arch Heart (area M9).

#### M7a: Royal Reading Room

Magical barriers enclose this room, keeping the water out. The room's keystone is set above the south door. If the keystone is destroyed or taken from this area, the barriers around the room disappear, causing water to burst in through the north doors and seep through cracks in the walls and roof. It takes 1 minute for the room to become entirely flooded. See the "Features of Cael Morrow" section for more information on the magical barriers and keystones.

The first time the characters enter this area, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Even though this magically illuminated room has been drained of water, the smell of rotting, waterlogged wood fills the air. Bookshelves lining the walls are filled with tomes and scrolls that have been turned to mush by centuries of submersion.
> 
> A female elf is sifting through the room's detritus, seeming exasperated. Standing near her but looking in your direction is a ten-foot-tall construct, its bipedal form made of metal, stone, and wood.
^2a2

A neutral evil, high elf [occult extollant](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/occult-extollant-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) named [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) has set up camp in this room along with Crescent, her [shield guardian](/compendium/bestiary/construct/shield-guardian.md). [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) wears the [shield guardian's amulet](/compendium/items/masters-amulet.md) around her neck but hides it under her shirt.

Modify [Galeokaerda's](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) stat block as follows:

- [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) speaks Celestial, Common, and Elvish.
- She has [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.
- She has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put her to sleep.

As described in the faction story tracks in chapter 4, [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) has long posed as a professor of the Allegiance of Allsight and has become [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)'s friend. Now she regrets betraying her friend and secretly hopes that she can convince [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) to turn against the Allegiance of Allsight when [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) and the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream take over Cael Morrow.

If the characters are on a mission that doesn't involve [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md), she tells them to get lost while claiming that she's doing research for the Allegiance of Allsight. If the characters refuse to leave, she threatens to unleash her shield guardian. But if the characters call her bluff, she doesn't follow through on her threat, afraid that doing so will lead to her defeat. If the characters attack [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) or Crescent, however, the two of them react in kind.

[Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) is suspicious of anyone she doesn't recognize, even someone affiliated with the Consortium. If the characters are on a mission that involves [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) and portray themselves as fellow explorers, she demands that they prove their worth by retrieving a clay tablet, which she describes as having a "sigil sequence" inscribed on it, from area M7b. If they do so, she tells them that she has identified the location of the Key to the Netherdeep: a ruined villa on the southern cliffs (area M13).

##### Double Agent

At the end of any conversation with [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md), a character can discern her true intentions and affiliation by making a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. Any character who observes [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) closely can, with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, spot the telltale markings of ruidium corruption on her arms. If a character calls attention to the marks, [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) hastily tries to explain how she got them in the line of duty; then she realizes that any explanation is fruitless and attacks.

#### M7b: Royal Study Chamber

This damaged, water-filled chamber contains a hungry [swarm of sorrowfish](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/swarm-of-sorrowfish-crcotn.md) (see appendix A).

##### Treasure

Lying on the floor in the middle of the room is a [teleportation tablet](/compendium/items/teleportation-tablet-crcotn.md) (see appendix B) that was left behind by a member of the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream. This individual was searching the area for relics when a giant shark entered through a hole in the roof. The agent panicked and fled, dropping the tablet on their way back to area M7a. [Galeokaerda](/compendium/bestiary/npc/galeokaerda-crcotn.md) wants to acquire the tablet, which connects to a teleportation circle on the roof of First Eclipse in Ank'Harel's Suncut Bazaar (see chapter 4).

#### M7c: Royal Ritual Chamber

This flooded chamber has been stripped bare by water and time.

The first time the characters enter this area, one among them (determined randomly) receives a telepathic message from the Alyxian Aboleth (see "Poisoned Emotions" earlier in the chapter).

A character who spends at least 1 minute searching the area can make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, uncovering a permanent teleportation circle on a success. A character who knows this circle's sigil sequence (which can be learned by studying the circle for 1 minute) can teleport to it using the [teleportation circle](/compendium/spells/teleportation-circle.md) spell.

#### M8: Submerged Library

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Broken clay tablets inscribed with writing lie among the detritus of this former library. What were once polished marble shelves are now coral-encrusted ruins overgrown with kelp. The shattered remains of a circular glass window give off flashes of reddish light.
^2a8

The first time the characters enter this area, one among them (determined randomly) receives a telepathic message from the Alyxian Aboleth (see "Poisoned Emotions" earlier in the chapter).

The writing on the tablets is in a script that has elements familiar to anyone who understands Elvish or Orc. Any character who spends at least 10 minutes searching through the detritus can make a DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, finding three unbroken tablets amid the rubble on a success.

When placed side by side in the proper order, the three tablets tell the story of the gathering of elves across Exandria; the blessing of Corellon upon their settlement, Cael Morrow; and the birth of the first orcs. Before the tablets can be manipulated in this way, however, the characters must deal with the ancient ghosts that haunt them.

##### Haunted Tablets

Each of the three unbroken tablets is inhabited by a lawful neutral [ghost](/compendium/bestiary/undead/ghost.md), desperate for a peaceful end to its suffering. When a Humanoid first touches a tablet, the ghost inside tries to possess the creature using its Possession action. If the creature resists that attempt, the ghost appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the tablet. After one ghost has emerged from its tablet, whether by possessing a creature or otherwise, the other two ghosts appear alongside it.

Two of the ghosts look like male elves, and the third looks like a female orc. All three are dressed in elegant robes trimmed with fine embroidery. The ghosts are not hostile; they try to possess creatures only so they can share their stories and thus find peace after death, but they defend themselves if attacked. While possessing a creature, a ghost moves the creature's body as far from combat as possible and doesn't force the creature to attack.

Any character who is possessed by one of the ghosts experiences a vision of the ghost's past life: their families and friends, the shining alabaster spires of their city in its prime, and the frantic attempts at evacuation as Gruumsh began his assault. The vision ends with a scene showing the two elves and the orc in a splendid library, about to sacrifice their lives in a futile attempt to preserve their history so that those they loved would not be forgotten. They look out from a library window and behold a nearby temple. A lone warrior with a spear and shield—Alyxian—stands atop the building. He is cast in shadow while the hundred-foot-tall figure of Gruumsh looms over him and laughs. As Gruumsh's spear descends on the temple, the vision goes dark. The vision takes 1 minute to play out in full. When it is over, the ghost ends the possession.

##### Speaking with the Ghosts

Characters who speak Elvish or Orc can converse with the ghosts, who speak an ancient dialect that forms the basis for both modern languages. The ghosts respect Alyxian the Apotheon, who they believe died in a vain attempt to defy Gruumsh. They know little about Alyxian beyond his divine connection to Sehanine, Avandra, and Corellon, and they are unaware of the Netherdeep and the existence of ruidium.

##### Laying the Dead to Rest

The ghosts find peace if they are reassured that they and their city will be remembered. A character can try to bring peace to the ghosts by offering reassuring words and then making a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. A character who was possessed by one of the ghosts has advantage on the check. On a successful check, the ghosts thank the character before disappearing in a shimmer of light. As a token of the ghosts' gratitude, the character gains "inspiration" (see the "Player's Handbook"). On a failed check, the ghosts are not laid to rest, and further attempts by that character to reassure the ghosts fail automatically.

### Cael Morrow Locations (M9-M17)

#### M9: Temple of the Arch Heart

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A once-majestic stone temple stands in the middle of a sunken courtyard. Alabaster pillars, glowing softly, surround the open area. Pulsing red light issues from an archway that leads inside the temple.
^2ae

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher notice a distortion in the light filtering through the water between the alabaster pillars and the center of the temple. The pillars project an [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) protective dome of divine magic around the temple. Only characters who are accompanied by a devout worshiper of Corellon can pass through this dome; otherwise, the dome can't be penetrated, is immune to all damage, and can't be dispelled in any way. If no characters in the party meet this requirement, the ghost of one of Corellon's priests can be found in area M14.

##### Temple Interior

If the characters move to a position where they can see through the archway in the temple's south wall, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The interior of the temple is dry. Lavishly sculpted pillars line the interior walls, and the floor is adorned with a mosaic of silver and green glass that depicts two verdant crescent moons atop a four-pointed star. At the center of the mosaic is a red crystal shard, pulsing with light in a mockery of a heartbeat. Scarlet tendrils radiate from it and crawl across the stonework. Against the north wall stands a statue of Corellon.
^2b0

The air in the temple is fresh and smells faintly of incense, although the source of the odor is not apparent. Corellon's divine magic hedges out the water, and the barrier stays in place as long as the statue of Corellon remains intact. The statue has AC 20; 80 hit points; and immunity to poison, psychic, and radiant damage. If the statue is destroyed, the divine ward around the temple ends, allowing water to pour in through the entrance and enabling creatures to enter the temple without being accompanied by a priest or cleric of Corellon.

##### First Vision

When the characters enter the temple for the first time, a sense of peace descends upon them, and a vision fills their minds:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> An image comes into focus. Alyxian is on his knees in this place, his head bent and his expression haggard. He looks old beyond his years. He raises his gaze to the statue of Corellon, his eyes clear despite the [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) showing on his face.
> 
> "Whatever it takes," he whispers, his voice filling the room. "Even if it costs my life and my soul. I will do what it takes to protect them."
^2b2

Any creature that comes within 10 feet of the pulsating red crystal at the center of the temple must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of it. This effect lasts until the creature leaves the temple. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw becomes immune to the crystal's fear-inducing effect.

##### Second Vision

The ruidium shard protruding from the mosaic is clearly out of place in the temple. The character who first makes physical contact with the crystal experiences a second vision:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A wash of light engulfs you, as does the sensation of traveling at great speed. You are going down, faster than you thought possible, as a sharp pain blooms above your breastbone. You keep plummeting. The light diminishes and then goes out.
> 
> Suddenly, you are looking down upon Alyxian as he floats in the blackness. His expression is one of slowly growing horror. He stretches an arm up to you, as though begging you to take his hand and save him.
> 
> "When you see me, permit me to leave," he says. "I can't do it myself. You must. You will!"
^2b4

The vision ends, and the red crystal lets out a loud hiss just before it cracks and explodes. Creatures in the temple who did not experience the second vision see the red crystal flare with light as it shatters. For a moment, a translucent image of Alyxian, his face stern and impatient, appears in the center of the temple. It then disappears, and all is quiet once more.

When the crystal shatters, the character who touched it must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the character takes 33 (6d10) psychic damage and gains 1 level of [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). If the character isn't already suffering from ruidium corruption, the character becomes corrupted when they fail the save. On a successful save, the character takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

When a character experiences the second vision, the Alyxian Aboleth loses its ability to poison the emotions of nearby creatures, and the Jewel of Three Prayers (see appendix B) transforms into its [Exalted State](/compendium/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-exalted-crcotn.md)—both consequences of gaining the blessing of Corellon the Arch Heart.

#### M10: Crumbling Building

This structure appears to be on the verge of collapse. Small, harmless fish dart in and out of the many cracks in the walls.

The first time the characters enter this area, one among them (determined randomly) receives a telepathic message from the Alyxian Aboleth (see "Poisoned Emotions" earlier in the chapter).

If the characters explore the interior of the building, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The walls are covered in faded murals that depict orcs and drow working together to build a city in the heart of a verdant jungle. Dozens of clay tablets are scattered across the floor.
^2b6

Four [scuttling serpentmaws](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/scuttling-serpentmaw-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) lurk amid the rubble and scuttle across the floor to attack characters who investigate the room. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 18 or higher notice the serpentmaws and aren't surprised when they attack.

##### Clay Tablets

Characters who spend 10 minutes searching the floor of the building find, among other clay tablets that describe ancient prayers and catechisms of the monks of the temple of Corellon, the particular tablet that [Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight) has been seeking (see "Insight's Quest" in mission 4 of the Cobalt Soul Story Track in chapter 4). This tablet is written in Celestial script. It reads:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> I know not who will read this, for if I survive, reading it will not be necessary, and if I die, none will be alive to do so. Yet I feel compelled to record my thoughts. The Ruiner and his legions close upon us. The walls are breached, reduced to rubble by the one-eyed god. Thousands have already died, and thousands more will as well, unless I can muster the courage to stop him.
> 
> Already the people call me "Apotheon." I do not deserve the title—but I shall claim it. If calling me a demigod gives them the courage to fight alongside me, I shall bear this mantle. And even if I am to fall in the hours to come, they will honor me by letting this sacrifice fuel their fight against the Betrayers. To that end, may the memory of this day never die.
^2b8

#### M11: Kelp Forest

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Once a lush garden, this area is now filled with strands of kelp that rise to a height of about thirty feet. Small shrines built of pale stone stand among the growth. Their surfaces are carved with images of the face of Corellon, serene and benevolent.
^2ba

Two [aboleth spawn](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/aboleth-spawn-crcotn.md) (see the accompanying stat block) guard the kelp forest. These tentacled creatures are bound to the Alyxian Aboleth and do its bidding. Their task is to guard the aboleth's treasure (see "Treasure" below).

The kelp forest is the lair of the [Alyxian Aboleth](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/alyxian-aboleth-crcotn.md) (see appendix A). If the aboleth retreated here to take a short rest, it tries to hide from interlopers until its rest is finished before attacking them. If the aboleth is not present but returns to find any of its treasure missing (see below), it scours Cael Morrow in search of the thieves, determined to destroy them.

##### Treasure

Any character who spends at least 5 minutes searching the kelp forest can make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, finding the aboleth's accumulated treasure on a success. This hoard consists of a pouch that holds 156 gp, a [ruidium shield](/compendium/items/ruidium-shield-crcotn.md) (see appendix B), a ruidium shortsword (see appendix B), and a [brooch of shielding](/compendium/items/brooch-of-shielding.md) still pinned to the garments of a water-bloated human corpse (the remains of an Allegiance of Allsight explorer).

#### M12: Cliffside Path

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A narrow, winding path ascends a steep, rocky slope strewn with oddly shaped chunks of stone. The path splits into two branches that each wind up a different eighty-foot-high peak. What's left of a once-elegant villa rests on one peak, and a crumbling watchtower adorns the other.
^2bd

Closer examination reveals that the chunks of stone are shaped like the dismembered hands, arms, legs, heads, and torsos of Humanoids. The head-shaped chunks all have screaming faces. These are the [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified) remains of the victims of the creature that has taken up residence in the villa (see area M13). A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes the signs of petrification and knows that the bodies are too broken to be restored to life.

#### M13: Villa

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The roof of this building has collapsed, but its twenty-foot-high walls remain mostly intact. Coral grows around a closed stone door at the base of the structure.
^2bf

The characters might run into their rivals in this location. The rivals, if present, are gathered in front of the villa and debating whether to enter through the door or by way of the open roof. Use the following text to describe what's inside:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Floating in the middle of the ruined villa is a huge, jellyfish-like creature with barbed tentacles. Its bell is covered with a crystalline lattice and has a greataxe with veins of ruidium arcing up the blade wedged in it. Beneath the bell, a tendrilous crimson mass crackles with energy and provides shelter for a school of tiny, sharp-toothed fish.
^2c0

A [death embrace](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/death-embrace-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) has made its lair in the ruins of this once magnificent location and attacks anyone who comes within reach of its tentacles. A [swarm of sorrowfish](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/swarm-of-sorrowfish-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) lurks among the tendrils of the [death embrace](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/death-embrace-crcotn.md), gaining half cover. When the [death embrace](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/death-embrace-crcotn.md) grapple||grapples a creature, the swarm loses its cover and the sorrowfish emerge to feed on the [grappled](/rules/conditions.md#grappled) creature.

##### Treasure

Embedded in the [death embrace](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/death-embrace-crcotn.md)'s bell is a ruidium greataxe (see appendix B), the so-called Key to the Netherdeep that the Allegiance of Allsight and the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream are after (see chapter 4). The axe can be removed from the [death embrace](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/death-embrace-crcotn.md) only after the creature is dead.

A character who spends 10 minutes searching the villa and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a locked jewelry box. The jewelry box can be opened by a character who makes either a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) or a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Inside are two emerald rings (1,500 gp each), a string of pearls (750 gp), and a [ring of shooting stars](/compendium/items/ring-of-shooting-stars.md).

#### M14: Watchtower

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This watchtower is perched on a high hilltop overlooking the rest of the sunken city. The structure is roughly thirty feet high but used to be taller. Part of it has collapsed, leaving the remaining structure with a jagged crown of loose-fitting stone. A single stone door leads into the tower at ground level.
^2c3

Characters who peer into the tower, either through the open door or by swimming up to the roof and looking down, view the following scene:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A crumbling staircase follows the inside wall as it climbs to a fifteen-foot-high balcony. The stairs continue upward until they disappear a few feet short of the open top of the tower. Armed, wraith-like forms move about inside the tower, like a battle-ready garrison that doesn't know the war is long over. Floating a few feet above the balcony is a pale, spectral orc.
^2c4

The tower is haunted by eight [sword wraith warriors](/compendium/bestiary/undead/sword-wraith-warrior-mpmm.md) under the command of Beltreath, a lawful neutral [sword wraith commander](/compendium/bestiary/undead/sword-wraith-commander-mpmm.md). See appendix A for these creatures' stat blocks.

The sword wraiths are former defenders of Cael Morrow who fell during the battle against Gruumsh. They are protecting the [ghost](/compendium/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) of Hadarai, a neutral good, orc priest of Corellon. Hadarai is soft-spoken and kindhearted. He swore a vow of pacifism centuries ago that he has never broken; even after being stripped of his mortal form, he won't fight or use Possession.

##### Roleplaying the Spirits

If the characters enter the tower or otherwise make their presence known, the discordant sound of a bugle pierces the water, and the warriors gather immediately to defend Hadarai and the tower.

Before raising his weapon, Beltreath explains that his warriors are the last wardens of the Drowned City and informs the characters that any invasion is unwelcome. If the characters explain their reason for being in Cael Morrow, Hadarai and Beltreath listen closely. If the characters' stated purpose involves helping the Apotheon, which Hadarai and Beltreath both regard as a worthy goal, the spirits become friendly toward the characters.

Hadarai met Alyxian once long ago, while the warrior was praying to Corellon for aid in the hours before Cael Morrow was destroyed. Hadarai is slow to accept that the Apotheon yet lives and can be saved, but a character can convince him of the truth of this claim with a successful DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If a character shows Hadarai the Jewel of Three Prayers, the check is made with advantage, since the ghost recognizes the jewel and knows its properties.

If combat breaks out and Beltreath is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he surrenders and begs the characters not to destroy him, for Hadarai's sake. If the characters show mercy, Hadarai is grateful and offers to assist them in any way he can. For example, the ghost, as a priest of Corellon, can help the characters bypass the magic ward around the temple (area M9) or can warn the characters about the [aboleth](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/alyxian-aboleth-crcotn.md) that haunts the city.

Wherever Hadarai goes, Beltreath and his sword wraiths follow. None of these spirits can leave Cael Morrow, nor would they want to.

#### M15: Collapsed Guard Tower

^2c7

The first time the characters enter this area, one among them (determined randomly) receives a telepathic message from the Alyxian Aboleth (see "Poisoned Emotions" earlier in the chapter).

##### Hidden Symbol and Trapdoor

A character who searches the tower ruins and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discovers a large symbol of Corellon inscribed on the floor, mostly hidden under sand and debris. Closer examination discloses a 5-foot-diameter, circular stone trapdoor disguised as part of the symbol. The trapdoor is closed and stuck. A character can use an action to try to pry it up by using a crowbar or similar tool, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A [knock](/compendium/spells/knock.md) spell or similar magic can also open it. If all else fails, the trapdoor (which has AC 17, 60 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage) can be destroyed.

##### Secret Armory

Below the trapdoor is a 10-foot-high, 20-foot-diameter circular armory. A corroded iron ladder descends into the chamber.

A character who searches the opening for traps and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check spots a tiny glyph inscribed along the edge of the opening, in a location that's not visible while the trapdoor is closed. If this glyph is dispelled with a successful casting of [dispel magic](/compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) (DC 17) or defaced using [mason's tools](/compendium/items/masons-tools.md) or similar equipment, the following trap ceases to function.

##### Trap

If a creature enters the armory without first saying a prayer to Corellon, a burst of radiance flares from the chamber. Each creature in the armory and within 15 feet of the trapdoor must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This trap can be triggered only once.

The burst of light from this trap attracts the [slithering bloodfins](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/slithering-bloodfin-crcotn.md) in area M16 and possibly the [Alyxian Aboleth](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/alyxian-aboleth-crcotn.md) (see appendix A for their stat blocks). If the aboleth is in the nearby kelp forest (area M11) when the trap is sprung, it sees the light and immediately moves to investigate it.

##### Treasure

The walls of the armory are festooned with longswords, shortswords, spears, longbows, shortbows, arrows in leather quivers, and steel shields—all corroded or rotted beyond usefulness. Among these objects are two magic items, both of which can be located quickly by using a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell: a [sentinel shield](/compendium/items/sentinel-shield.md) and a frost brand longsword. A character must otherwise spend at least 1 minute searching the armory to find these magic items.

#### M16: Collapsed Ruins

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The toppled ruins of a palace are strewn across the cavern floor. Yellow-green kelp sprouts from the cracks between heaps of crumbled stone, and corroded silver and bronze spires lie bent and broken as schools of iridescent fish swim between them.
^2cd

Unless the characters killed them in area M15, three [slithering bloodfins](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/slithering-bloodfin-crcotn.md) (see appendix A) prowl this area in search of prey. The characters spot them—three streaks of crimson darting through the ruins. Unless the characters move away from the ruins immediately, the bloodfins swim toward the intruders and attack.

#### M17: Rift to the Netherdeep

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Amid the ruins of a sunken palace is a gaping rift that pulsates with sickly red light. Black energy swirling with oily colors shimmers and hisses inside the opening of the rift. Glowing spines of ruidium sprout from its edges, forming a jagged, partially intact dome around the space.
^2cf

If the characters have yet to defeat the [Alyxian Aboleth](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/alyxian-aboleth-crcotn.md) (see appendix A), it senses their intrusion into this area and arrives 1 minute later, attacking the characters in a rage.

The rift to the Netherdeep is covered with, and protected by, a film of black energy streaked with all the colors of the spectrum, appearing much like an oil slick. Water, liquids, and creatures native to the Netherdeep can pass through this barrier in either direction, but no other creatures or objects can do so unless the barrier is pierced by a ruidium weapon (see below).

##### Opening the Rift

To enter the rift, the characters must force it open using one of the following items:

- A ruidium weapon, like the one in area M13. Touching the weapon's edge to the barrier opens the rift.
- The [Jewel of Three Prayers](/compendium/items/jewel-of-three-prayers-exalted-crcotn.md) in its Exalted State. When a creature brings the amulet within 10 feet of the rift, it glows with holy light that pierces the barrier protecting the rift.

Each creature within 60 feet of the rift when it comes open must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) psychic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the rift is opened, the characters can use this route to enter the Netherdeep. The rift closes after 1 hour but can be forced open again.

##### Into the Netherdeep

The rift to the Netherdeep opens directly into area N1 in chapter 6. The first time they reach this area, the characters might not carry out a full exploration. It's likely that they'll return to Cael Morrow and then to the surface, especially if anyone in the party is susceptible to the effects of water pressure, as described in chapter 6. If they are slow to reenter the Netherdeep, a directive from their faction might be necessary to encourage them to follow their mission to its completion.
