# Chapter 7: The Heart of Despair
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep* 

The Heart of Despair is a prison of the Apotheon's own making. Nothing traps him in the Netherdeep except his belief that he doesn't deserve to leave. He has called the characters to his location so that they can deem him worthy of returning to the world. By the time they're ready to enter the Heart of Despair, the characters should have learned enough about the Apotheon to pass judgment on his future. Their options are as follows:

- Allow the Apotheon to go free without first healing his emotional wounds (and in doing so, cause his corruption to wreak havoc throughout Exandria)
- Deem the Apotheon beyond redemption and destroy him
- Heal the Apotheon's emotional wounds and bring him peace before granting him his freedom

## Running This Chapter

Read this chapter thoroughly before running it, paying particular attention to the stat blocks for Alyxian's forms and the "Lair Actions" section, which describes actions the Apotheon can take in any of his forms.

## Within the Heart

Characters who enter the Heart of Despair find themselves standing in the middle of the area, just south of a statue of Alyxian (area H1). Describe the environment as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You pass through clammy darkness and tumble onto the glassy surface of a lake, which feels as solid under your feet as any floor. Rising out of the water are three rocky isles, upon which rest crumbling structures that look like ancient prayer sites.
> 
> Waterfalls tumble from the clear sky, giving off mist that blankets the area in shimmering silver. Directly in front of you, a life-sized statue of Alyxian armed with a spear and a shield stands on a white stone pedestal that rises inches above the water's surface. The statue's expression is serene, much like the water.
^3b0

The interior of the Heart of Despair is a cylindrical space 200 feet high and over 200 feet in diameter. The water here is 20 feet deep.

Every visitor to the Heart and each of Alyxian's forms gains the benefit of a [water walk](/compendium/spells/water-walk.md) spell upon arrival; this effect lasts for 1 hour. A creature can end the effect on itself at any time (no action required), enabling it to sink below the water's surface. Once the effect ends on a creature, it can't be reactivated.

### Dealing with the Rivals

Rivals who follow the characters into the Heart of Despair behave in one of two ways, depending on their attitude toward the characters:

- **Friendly or Indifferent Rivals..** The rivals allow the characters to deal with Alyxian in whatever manner they see fit, fighting alongside them if need be.
- **Hostile Rivals..** The rivals attack the characters.

### Locations in the Heart

The following locations are keyed to the Heart of Despair map.

#### H1: Statue of Alyxian

This painted stone statue depicts Alyxian as a young man. See "Alyxian Speaks" below for more information about the statue.

#### H2–H4: Prayer Sites

The ruins on the three islands are prayer sites dedicated to Avandra the Change Bringer (area H2), Corellon the Arch Heart (area H3), and Sehanine the Moon Weaver (area H4). The Apotheon draws on the power of these ruins when he takes his lair actions, as described in the "Lair Actions" section.

### Alyxian Speaks

Before the characters begin exploring the Heart of Despair, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The Apotheon's voice emanates from the statue and says, "After so long, we can finally speak to one another, and I am overjoyed. You have seen what I have done. What I have become. You, better than anyone, have the clarity of sight to judge me. May I leave?"
^3b6

The Apotheon's inviting words should give the characters an uneasy, hesitant feeling. Alyxian believes they are the only beings alive who understand him well enough to judge him worthy of returning to the world. Whatever their decision, it must be unanimous (see "Deciding Alyxian's Fate" below).

The statue contains Alyxian's spirit. It is an object with AC 18, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the characters destroy the statue, jump ahead to the "Battle for the Soul of the Apotheon" section.

#### Deciding Alyxian's Fate

If the characters grant the Apotheon his freedom, he gasps in surprise. This is the outcome he wants, but his own self-loathing did not prepare him for this answer, since deep down he knows he's in no condition to leave. He asks the characters if they are sure of their decision, whereupon any character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check can sense the doubt that caused the Apotheon to question their decision. If the characters choose to free him at this point, proceed with the "Worst Ending: Unleashing Devastation" section.

Alyxian is willing to chat amicably with the characters and answer any questions they have—up to a point. Freedom is within his sight after eons of suffering. He is impatient, restless, and determined to end this chapter of his existence. He keeps the conversation going as long as he believes he's convincing the characters that he's a good person. If the characters don't come to a decision or start to question his assertions, frustration starts to creep into his tone, then anger.

If the characters ask about certain topics, you can read or paraphrase Alyxian's replies. Whenever he gives an answer, a character can make a DC 21 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. On a failed check, the character views him as sincere, sorrowful, and grateful. On a successful check, the character can tell he's deeply conflicted. On a check that succeeds by 5 or more, the character can also tell that he is growing impatient for the characters to judge him worthy. The following are the topics and Alyxian's replies:

- **Alyxian's Personality..** "I have been cursed by fate. By some cruel joke of the cosmos. If I am to suffer, was it not right that I should allow my suffering to spare others from the same fate?"
- **Alyxian's Past..** "I was born as the Calamity raged around me. I grew up knowing fear, and I watched the Betrayer Gods turn my home into a barren wasteland. My only regrets are that I could not save others... and that my sacrifices were not enough to free me from my fate."
- **Alyxian's Future..** "I have dreamed of my future for so long, but now that you ask, I find my dreams have abandoned me. I want to walk by myself along the streets of a city where no one has cause to fear or loathe me."
- **Alyxian's Regret..** "You have felt my remorse and witnessed all the memories that I have prayed to be rid of. I am grateful for your actions in the retelling of those memories. I have watched them so many times, I wept to see that they could have turned out happily."
- **Alyxian's Fury..** "I am filled with hatred. For the god who condemned me to this hell, and for the people who tear at my essence to satisfy their own greed. Does that scare you?" (The god Alyxian refers to is Gruumsh. The people Alyxian refers to are the factions who want to take ruidium from the Netherdeep and use it for their own ends.)
- **Alyxian's Yearning..** "I have been imprisoned for so long, I dreamed of many things. Those dreams gave me hope, but—but now you are here! They needn't be fantasies any longer."
- **The Heart of Despair..** "It defies belief that this beautiful place is the source of so much suffering. Let us not speak of this place any longer. I simply wish to be free of it."
- **Ruidium..** "Do not speak to me of that wretched stuff. I would sooner slay anyone who takes it from my domain than see it used again. Let us be rid of this evil place and deal with ruidium later."

#### Upsetting the Apotheon

If a character points out that Alyxian seems angry during their conversation, he hastily retorts, "I am impatient. The world above sings to me, and you withhold judgment from me. What is your decision? Am I free to go? Choose!"

If any option other than unconditional release from his prison is suggested, if the characters take too long to decide, or if the characters doubt him openly, the Apotheon turns hostile. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The Heart of Despair rumbles. The water churns as if in anger, and the sounds of breaking glass and cracking stone pierce the space as the Apotheon speaks. "I have prayed for freedom. I have begged for release. I have screamed to an uncaring world and the impassive heavens for salvation. Yet even here, with you before me, I am denied! No more waiting. I will claim everything I have waited these long centuries for, and you will be the ones the world forgot."
^3b9

Proceed with the next section.

## Battle for the Soul of the Apotheon

Angering the Apotheon or denying him his release triggers a three-stage battle that begins as follows:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The statue of Alyxian melts into a mass of pulsing black ichor. It fills your nose with a putrid scent, like a combination of iron and rotted meat. Thunder booms as crimson storm clouds blot out the sky. Bright red light flares from the ruined prayer sites, which are crawling with tendrils of ruidium that glow with malevolent power. Silence hangs over the lake for a moment.
> 
> Then the silence breaks. A milky-white monster with dozens of arms, too many blinking eyes, and a thick hide festooned with blades bursts out of the inky ooze. It rears back, then crashes down onto the lake as it howls in vengeance.
^3bb

The battle with the Apotheon begins.

### How to Run the Encounter

The following sections describe how the battle against the Apotheon is expected to play out.

#### Multiple Stages

The Apotheon has multiple forms that the characters encounter in sequence, each with its own stat block. Three of these forms—[Alyxian the Tormented](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-tormented-crcotn.md), [Alyxian the Callous](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-callous-crcotn.md), and [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md)—are hostile. The Apotheon has a fourth form—[Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md)—that poses no threat to the characters and appears only if the Apotheon is redeemed. The sequence is as follows:

Stage 1. The battle begins with the appearance of [Alyxian the Tormented](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-tormented-crcotn.md). When this form is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears and is replaced by [Alyxian the Callous](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-callous-crcotn.md).

Stage 2. When [Alyxian the Callous](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-callous-crcotn.md) is reduced to 0 hit points, this form of the Apotheon disappears and is replaced by [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md).

Stage 3. When [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md) is reduced to 0 hit points, the Apotheon is well and truly dead. If [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md) is redeemed instead of killed, he transforms into [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md). Either way, the battle ends.

#### Emotional Healing

While in the form of [Alyxian the Tormented](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-tormented-crcotn.md), [Alyxian the Callous](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-callous-crcotn.md), or [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md), the Apotheon taunts the characters, but an underlying sadness and regret hint that something humane still lives within him—a fragment of his original psyche that is desperate to curb his destructive tendencies yet unable to break free of the torment that drives his actions. By reaching out with words of empathy and compassion, the characters can help Alyxian achieve a kind of catharsis, leading to his redemption.

Have Alyxian speak to the characters often, to convey that this is not just a drawn-out combat encounter but an opportunity to rid Alyxian of his corruption. During the battle, the characters can improve Alyxian's emotional state by speaking to him with supportive words and succeeding on one or more Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks. With each successful check, they weaken his current form and push him toward assuming a less monstrous form. See the various stages of the battle, described below, for how to resolve these checks.

##### Placating the Apotheon

Count the number of times the characters' actions in chapter 6 placated the Apotheon. Then share this number with the players. This number indicates how many times the characters can gain advantage on their Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks to improve Alyxian's emotional state.

### Lair Actions

Rising from the lake are fallen temples to Sehanine the Moon Weaver, Avandra the Change Bringer, and Corellon the Arch Heart, imagined into being by the despairing and lonely Apotheon. These structures stand atop 20-foot-tall rocky isles. Regardless of his current form, Alyxian can draw on the power of these profane ruins to take lair actions. Each lair action is associated with a particular site; when a lair action is used, the corresponding ruin glows with bright crimson light that lingers until initiative count 20 of the next round.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Alyxian can take one of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Avandra's Grasp..** Alyxian uses the power of Avandra's ruined temple (area H2) to create a watery tendril that rises out of the lake. One creature Alyxian can see that's not submerged in the lake must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the tendril. The tendril is a Large object that has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The tendril disappears when it is reduced to 0 hit points or the next time Alyxian takes a lair action.
- **Corellon's Charm..** Alyxian causes a magical wisp of light to emerge from Corellon's ruined temple (area H3). The wisp enters the body of one creature Alyxian can see that isn't inside Corellon's ruined temple or atop the rocky island that supports it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by Alyxian until initiative count 20 of the next round.
- **Sehanine's Torment..** Alyxian uses the power of Sehanine's ruined temple (area H4) to create a watery form in the space of one creature that is either standing on the lake or submerged in it. The watery form assumes the vague likeness of the creature whose space it occupies and makes one melee weapon attack (+7 to hit) against it. On a hit, the attack deals 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Whether it hits or misses, the watery form disappears after making its attack.

#### Prayers to the Gods

A character can use an action to pray to Avandra, Corellon, or Sehanine in the deity's prayer site. The character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, and the check has advantage if the character is a worshiper of that god. On a successful check, the profane ruins atop the island melt away, and Alyxian can no longer use the lair action associated with that prayer site. In addition, Alyxian takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage, regardless of his current form.

### Stage 1: Alyxian the Tormented

Alyxian's first form is gigantic and monstrous, for it represents the most corrupted version of the Apotheon. All the pain that torments his soul is made manifest upon his flesh to such an extent that it eclipses the gentle soul within. In this form, he uses the accompanying [Alyxian the Tormented](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-tormented-crcotn.md) stat block.

#### Emotional State

Devoid of virtually every attribute that once made him a hero, [Alyxian the Tormented](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-tormented-crcotn.md) is nihilistic, despondent, and wrathful. He attaches the worst possible interpretation to what the characters say, believes them to be his enemies, rebuffs their attempts to help, and mocks them at every turn.

The following bits of dialogue are examples of what he might say in this emotional state:

- "You can't understand. No one can understand the pain of spending years beyond counting in darkness."
- "No one remembers. No one cares. Even you!"
- "Even you will be forgotten. Do you trust them? Your friends? Do not trust. Do not grow close."

#### Comforting Alyxian the Tormented

As an action, a character can speak to [Alyxian the Tormented](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-tormented-crcotn.md) with empathy and compassion, after which the character can make a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a failed check, the character's words do not resonate with Alyxian. On a successful check, [Alyxian the Tormented](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-tormented-crcotn.md) loses 20 hit points as he tries to shed his monstrous form, causing chunks of his body to slough off. As gruesome as this sight might seem, Alyxian's emotional state appears to improve as a result. The following bits of dialogue are examples of what he might say in response to the characters' helpful words:

- "How can I forgive them for this suffering?"
- "Of course, you can say such things! You have had family, friends, allies, and each other."
- "This monstrous form... you must destroy it. I can feel its hatred tearing at me. Please! I can feel my spirit inside straining to escape!"

### Stage 2: Alyxian the Callous

When [Alyxian the Tormented](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-tormented-crcotn.md) is reduced to 0 hit points, read or paraphrase the following text as his second form sprouts from the husk of his first one:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The corpse splits open like a cocoon, and a radiant figure with angelic wings and wreathed in a halo of spears emerges from the husk. With a gleaming spear in his hand, he looks down on you as if in judgment. In a cold voice he says, "Your words mean nothing. I am the Apotheon, born of the blessing of three gods. Thousands died by my hand. You will be no different."
^3c7

To spare himself the pain that comes with feeling, Alyxian has hidden his emotions beneath the expressionless mask of a killer. In this form, he uses the [Alyxian the Callous](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-callous-crcotn.md) stat block.

#### Emotional State

[Alyxian the Callous](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-callous-crcotn.md) is cold and distant, disregarding words he doesn't care to hear. He sees himself as a perfect, "holy" being and believes that the world should be condemned for its crimes against him.

The following bits of dialogue are examples of what he might say in this emotional state:

- "What crime have I committed other than craving freedom? Why do you not condemn those who left me to rot?"
- "It is as I thought: you are imperfect judges. You have not known my suffering. No one can know it; I am my only judge."
- "I have lived a thousand lifetimes and felt a million sorrows. I am the judge this world deserves—and mine will be the final decree."

#### Comforting Alyxian the Callous

As an action, a character can speak to [Alyxian the Callous](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-callous-crcotn.md) with empathy and compassion, after which the character can make a DC 17 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a failed check, the character's words do not resonate with Alyxian. On a successful check, [Alyxian the Callous](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-callous-crcotn.md) loses 25 hit points as his current form withers. As painful as this effect might seem, Alyxian's emotional state appears to improve as a result.

The following bits of dialogue are examples of what he might say in response to the characters' helpful words:

- "You do have a way with words, puny one."
- "If the world will not pay for the hurt it caused me, then what? What happens?"
- "How can this be righteousness? How is any of this allowed by fate, by gods that once fought by my side?"
- "If there is no justice in this world, then the least you can do is grant me an honorable defeat. Come forth! Let us waste no more time on words."

### Stage 3: Alyxian the Dispossessed

When [Alyxian the Callous](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-callous-crcotn.md) is reduced to 0 hit points, read or paraphrase the following text as his third form erupts from the remains of his second one:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The Apotheon's angelic form falls, striking the ground in a golden starburst. Its gleaming feathers crumble to ash as Alyxian rises yet again. Before you, hunched and weary, is an old, haggard man. His gray hair falls over his face in loose strands, and he snarls as he readies his spear and his shield.
^3cb

His heroic countenance shattered, Alyxian's radiant form sloughs off, revealing an old man. In this form, he uses the [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md) stat block.

#### Emotional State

[Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md) is tired. The weariness that has built up in him over the centuries has begun to overcome his anger and bitterness. Now he needs to be guided back into the light.

The following bits of dialogue are examples of what he might say in this emotional state:

- "This world has moved beyond me. There is no place in it for a bitter man such as I."
- "How could the gods ever forgive me for what I have done? I'm too old for redemption."
- "Your naivete shows itself. The omens of Ruidus haunt me now as they did many moons ago."

#### Comforting Alyxian the Dispossessed

As an action, a character can speak to [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md) with empathy and compassion, after which the character can make a DC 19 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If a character can think of another way to remind Alyxian of the good man he could still be, have the character make a DC 19 ability check using whichever ability and skill you think is appropriate. On a failed check, the character's words do not resonate with Alyxian. On a successful check, years of negative emotions seem to drain away from him. After three successful checks, [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md) achieves catharsis and transforms into [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md) (see "Alyxian Redeemed" below).

The following bits of dialogue are examples of what he might say as [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md):

- "I have survived for this long. Surely it was for some purpose."
- "I have heard echoes of the most beautiful things from the surface. Laughter. Music. Joy. I want to see them. To know them again."
- "What is left of the world that I once knew?"

### Ending the Battle

The climactic battle ends with Alyxian victorious, defeated, or redeemed. These outcomes are discussed below.

#### Alyxian Victorious

If Alyxian defeats the characters, he disappears with a cackle. His victory triggers the worst possible outcome, as described in the "Worst Ending: Unleashing Devastation" section later in the chapter.

When Alyxian disappears, all creatures inside in the Heart of Desire—alive or dead—are transported to unoccupied spaces in area N26 (see chapter 6), which is now an empty, flooded, spherical chamber.

#### Alyxian Defeated

If [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md) dies, any hope of the Apotheon's redemption dies with him. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Alyxian lets out a long, rattling sigh as ichor trickles from his wounds. He coughs, and a gout of the fluid spurts from his mouth. Ruidium veins creep up his neck, and he smiles ruefully. He drops to his knees, reduced to a shriveled, gaunt figure, and lets out a last whimper that is undeniably human.
> 
> "I have been so cold." The light leaves his eyes. "So cold and so alone." With that, he falls into the lake and sinks into the water.
^3d1

After Alyxian dies, all creatures inside the Heart of Desire—alive or dead—are transported to unoccupied spaces in area N26, which is now an empty, flooded, spherical chamber. Proceed with the "Neutral Ending: Alyxian at Rest" section.

#### Alyxian Redeemed

Upon assuming the form of [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md) (see the accompanying stat block), the Apotheon no longer has any desire to fight the characters. Read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The Apotheon looks toward the sky. He takes in a long breath, then releases it, shuddering as tears run down his face. A smile of relief comes over his countenance.
> 
> "My soul feels so light," he whispers. He locks eyes with each of you, one by one, and says, "Please. Let us leave this cursed place."
^3d3

If the characters unanimously grant permission for [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md) to leave his self-made prison, proceed with the "Best Ending: A World That Remembered" section. If they kill [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md), the story takes the direction described in "Neutral Ending: Alyxian at Rest."

## Back into the Light

The ending of this adventure tries to resolve any major questions that remain by providing explanations for what happened to the Apotheon, what happened to the rivals, and what happened to the factions. Other issues, including the fate of the characters and any nonplayer characters they grew attached to, are left for you and your players to resolve.

### Possible Endings

How this story ends hinges on the outcome of the battle against Alyxian.

#### Neutral Ending: Alyxian at Rest

_Alyxian is defeated instead of being redeemed._

This ending applies if the characters, refusing to trust the Apotheon enough to allow him his freedom, destroy him during the final confrontation and thereby deprive the Netherdeep of its vital essence.

##### Ruidium's End

Upon Alyxian's death, all ruidium on Exandria melts away, leaving no trace of the substance anywhere in the world. Creatures suffering from ruidium corruption are instantly rid of it. Magic items that contain ruidium transform as described in appendix B.

##### Escape from the Netherdeep

Without the power of the Apotheon to sustain it, the Netherdeep begins to collapse. Creatures have 30 minutes to escape from the Netherdeep as it crumbles around them; those who fail to get out are lost. If the characters have a clear path back to area N1 (see chapter 6), escaping in this amount of time is doable. If the characters pass through one or more areas that contain hostile creatures, these creatures (which might include the rival adventurers) do their best to waylay the characters.

##### Parting Vision

Characters who escape from the Netherdeep receive a vision of the Apotheon. The characters see him with his back turned to them as he receives the killing blow from Gruumsh. Then the characters see themselves, one after the other, striking the same blow. The Apotheon's blood seeps into the sand and disappears from sight. Time passes, and sandstorms rage, then clear, revealing that flowers have begun sprouting from the blood-drenched sand. Then buildings begin to emerge, forming the city of Ank'Harel—which is now at peace thanks to their actions.

#### Worst Ending: Unleashing Devastation

_Alyxian is granted freedom without regaining compassion._

If the characters take pity on the Apotheon and grant him his freedom without healing his emotional wounds, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The statue of Alyxian explodes, spraying debris and black ichor. The prayer sites, too, explode into rubble as the Apotheon siphons off their last vestiges of power. His voice resounds from everywhere as he screams, "Never again will they forget my name!" A titanic mass of oily, slick shadow gushes past you and tears a hole in the edge of the Heart of Despair.
> 
> A wave of darkness comes over you. You are left gasping for breath, but that is the least of your worries.
> 
> Ruin is coming to Exandria.
^3db

After escaping from the Heart of Despair, the Apotheon races through the Netherdeep and erupts in Ank'Harel. Darkness fills the sky above the city, as if it were a moonless, starless night—and then Ruidus's light blazes abruptly, filling the inky sky with crimson ire.

After ruminating over his regret, fury, yearning, and despair for an age, the Apotheon condemns the world that allowed him to be imprisoned after a lifetime of selflessness. His vengeance is all-consuming, his pain unending. For the next year and a day, Ruidus remains a full moon, shining with unnatural brightness. During this time, Alyxian can appear anywhere in the world in the form of an oily black cloud that can reduce cities to rubble in a matter of days.

##### Escape from the Netherdeep

Without the power of the Apotheon to sustain it, the Netherdeep begins to collapse (see "Neutral Ending: Alyxian at Rest" above). When the characters emerge from the Netherdeep, they find Ank'Harel ablaze, its people screaming and fleeing for safety. Alyxian's voice, distorted and hateful, booms out, "Soon, all shall remember!"

To continue a campaign in the midst of this devastation, you can devise a way to stop this wrathful avatar from razing all of Exandria, which could be the characters receiving blessings from other Prime Deities to compete against his power; raising an Exandrian army to face him and the occult worshipers who flock to him; or, for a party that is desperate or daring, seeking help from the Betrayer Gods (see "What of the Deities?" below).

#### Best Ending: A World That Remembered

_Alyxian is shown kindness and reminded of love._

When the Apotheon's corruption has been neutralized, the characters can speak to Alyxian's true self. They can remind him of the great deeds he has done and could still do, as well as express gratitude for his sacrifice on behalf of the world at large. As Alyxian sheds the last of his bitterness, pain, and fury, he becomes a humble man once more. In this form, he is truly ready to return to the world above.

> [!quote] Roleplaying Alyxian the Absolved
> 
> If the characters save the Apotheon's tortured soul, [Alyxian the Dispossessed](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-dispossessed-crcotn.md) fades away and is replaced by [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md). Though he is not as he was before the horrors of the Netherdeep, this form of Alyxian has been relieved of his burdens. He has found freedom from years of anguish and regret. [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md) is neither an aberrant monster nor a divine avenger; he is, as he always was, a man seeking serenity.

> [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md) can help the characters escape from the Netherdeep as it collapses, and he might even come to the party's aid in future adventures—though he would prefer to live out his remaining mortal days in peace. See "Best Ending: A World That Remembered" for more information.

##### Ruidium's End

The Apotheon who caused the spread of ruidium is dead, replaced by a version of the Apotheon who is at peace with himself and the world. The destruction of Alyxian's corrupted forms causes all ruidium throughout Exandria to melt away, leaving no trace of the substance anywhere in the world. Creatures suffering from ruidium corruption are instantly rid of it. Magic items that contain ruidium transform as described in appendix B.

##### Escape from the Netherdeep

The Netherdeep reacts violently when the characters heal the scars on the Apotheon's soul. Creatures have 30 minutes to escape from the Netherdeep as it crumbles around them; those who fail to get out are lost. If the characters have a clear path back to area N1 (see chapter 6) and can breathe water, escaping in this length of time is a simple task. If the characters pass through one or more areas that contain hostile creatures, these creatures do their best to waylay the characters. [Alyxian the Absolved](/compendium/bestiary/npc/alyxian-the-absolved-crcotn.md) casts [water breathing](/compendium/spells/water-breathing.md) and fights by the characters' side in any such conflict. If the rivals are among these hostile creatures, they flee rather than face Alyxian in battle.

##### Finale in the Light

No longer hampered by his fury, his memories, and the empty silence of the Netherdeep, Alyxian gapes in wonderment at Ank'Harel. The busy city that stretches out before him is filled with pleasant chatter, birdsong, and sunlight. He flinches, overwhelmed, and feels out of place in this new world. The characters can either help him settle into his new life or leave him to his own devices. Either way, in time, he finds peace and makes new friends.

At your discretion, one of the Prime Deities most closely tied to Alyxian (Avandra, Corellon, or Sehanine) might reward each character with a blessing of your choice (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

### What of the Factions?

The nature of the characters' ongoing relationships with the factions of Ank'Harel depends on what becomes of Alyxian, what happens to ruidium, and what the characters do after emerging from the Netherdeep.

Characters who represented their faction vigorously and who provided resources (ruidium or otherwise) for their faction might be asked to assume positions of leadership. If either the story's neutral ending or best ending comes to pass, all ruidium is destroyed—an outcome that delights the Cobalt Soul, vexes the Allegiance of Allsight, and infuriates the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.

### What of the Rivals?

The characters' rivals have experienced their share of triumphs, tragedies, and trials. The following sections describe likely ending scenarios for the rivals, depending on their attitude toward the characters.

#### Friendly Rivals

If the rivals are friendly, their actions from here on depend on what happens to Alyxian:

- **Alyxian Is Killed..** The rivals help the heroes escape from the Netherdeep. Sometime later, they invite the characters to a tavern in Ank'Harel to share their memories of the Netherdeep, then try to put it all behind them.
- **Alyxian Is Unleashed..** The rivals become staunch allies of the characters. The rivals agree to go wherever the party sends them to help stem the disaster.
- **Alyxian Is Redeemed..** The rivals, recognizing and accepting that the characters have prevailed, honor the heroes during a night of celebration together. They might become fast friends of the characters in time.

#### Indifferent Rivals

If the rivals are indifferent, their actions from here on depend on what happens to Alyxian:

- **Alyxian Is Killed..** The rivals report what happened to their faction leaders, casting themselves as neither better nor worse than the characters. They take their leave in search of a place to build a new reputation for themselves.
- **Alyxian Is Unleashed..** The rivals blame the characters for the cataclysm now facing the world but realize that their only hope of survival is to band together against their common enemy.
- **Alyxian Is Redeemed..** The rivals thank the characters for engaging in the "race" with them, which didn't really seem to have a winner. Ayo remarks, "Next time there's something you want, we'll be there for you—maybe just to be a thorn in your side." Her parting words seem warm enough.

#### Hostile Rivals

If the rivals are hostile, their actions from here on depend on what happens to Alyxian:

- **Alyxian Is Killed..** The rivals report to their faction that the characters have destroyed their access to ruidium and killed a legendary hero. They sabotage the characters' relationship with their own faction as much as they can and angle to become viewed as the more accomplished adventurers.
- **Alyxian Is Unleashed..** The rivals blame the characters for the devastation Alyxian causes. They complicate the characters' dealings with political leaders and nations, taking every opportunity to portray the characters as selfish, untrustworthy meddlers.
- **Alyxian Is Redeemed..** The rivals, realizing that their further efforts here would be to no avail, set out for distant lands to find a new way to make their mark in the world.

#### Heroes Unsung

If the rivals died in the Netherdeep, the characters are haunted by dreams of them for a few weeks. In these dreams, they might see Maggie's solemn, steady gaze as she speaks, but not be able to hear what she is trying to tell them. They might see Ayo erupting in an outburst of anger, Galsariad fruitlessly trying to turn back time to change his party's fate, Dermot mourning his friends, and Irvan wondering if he ever did something great.

Eventually, the dreams subside, but on their final night, Ayo steps up to each character in turn and offers a salute. "We didn't do too badly, huh?" she says quietly. "Remember us. Maybe with a monument back in Jigow? That would be nice."

### What of the Deities?

This adventure has chronicled Alyxian's relationship with three Prime Deities: Avandra, Corellon, and Sehanine. By the end of the adventure, the characters are heroes in their own right—and they have had opportunities to act in the name of the same deities Alyxian once heralded. If Alyxian threatens to bring doom to the world, these gods might send celestial envoys to entreat directly with the characters:

- **Avandra the Change Bringer..** Avandra might reach out to paladins, druids, clerics, wizards, the adventurous, and the bold. She encourages her faithful to grasp their fate, embrace change for the better, and rise against the threat posed by Alyxian. If the characters need her aid, her [solars](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/solar.md) and [planetars](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md) might deliver useful information about places they hope to visit, or Avandra might provide the occasional swing of fate in the characters' favor.
- **Corellon the Arch Heart..** Corellon might reach out to elves, spellcasters, the artistic, and the clever. Although Corellon offers direct support less often than other deities, their servants or the strange visions Corellon provides often coax adventurers into searching for forgotten secrets and spells, empowering these heroes through the fruits of discovery and inspiration. Arcane tools of this sort can be useful in overcoming any future threat.
- **Sehanine the Moon Weaver..** Sehanine might reach out to bards, rogues, druids, clerics, and the mischievous. Her childlike form appears to such individuals in dreams. If the characters need her aid, she might send the [deva](/compendium/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) [Perigee](/compendium/bestiary/npc/perigee-crcotn.md) to offer them support or a place of refuge.

#### Betrayer Gods

The Betrayer Gods might tempt adventurers (either the same group who freed Alyxian or a new band of heroes) into forming an alliance against Alyxian if the Apotheon can't be subdued any other way. The following are boons the Betrayer Gods might offer to a party—for a price:

**Asmodeus** might provide a legion of devils.

**Gruumsh and Bane** might provide armies of marauders and warriors.

**Lolth** might offer to sow dissension among the mortals that have begun to worship Alyxian, fostering chaos and rebellion to stem that tide.

**Tiamat** might offer to send an ancient chromatic dragon—or five—to aid in an assault or a siege at a critical moment.

**Torog** might send a horde of demons and purple worms to assail the fortifications of the characters' enemies.

**Vecna** might offer previously forbidden arcane power, gifting the characters with powerful magic items that will eventually corrupt them.

**Zehir** might send assassins to their aid, or he might furnish the characters with a poison that weakens anyone imbued with divinity.

Although any of these alliances are potentially beneficial in the short term, receiving any of these benefits will require the characters to partake in actions or rituals that strengthen the Betrayer Gods and their hold over Exandria. Then, once Alyxian is dealt with, their cults' domination of the world can begin.

### What of Our Heroes?

When all is said and done, the characters are credited as the ones who brought peace to a tormented soul or blamed for unleashing that soul upon an unsuspecting world.

If the characters achieve some measure of renown, their reputation precedes them if they travel to faraway lands. They are approached by eager folk with questions about what lies below Ank'Harel. "Tell us of Cael Morrow," they'll say. As time passes, the characters might become known more broadly as "the Redeemers," "the Prayer Bearers," "the Hope Bringers," "the Soul Healers," or any one of a hundred other names that bring to mind the mythic heroes who plunged into the Netherdeep and experienced both triumph and tragedy.
