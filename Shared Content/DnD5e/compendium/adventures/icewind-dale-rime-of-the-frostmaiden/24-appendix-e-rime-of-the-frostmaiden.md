> 
> We bow to She who wears the crown; Let the world shiver with dread. Clad in winter's whitest gown, Her snow enshrouds the dead.
> 
> Her fury sheds but frozen tears as gray clouds issue forth. Her wind across the wasteland shears, bringing blizzards from the north.
> 
> Ice-kissed flowers caught mid-bloom, beauty kept in all its grace. Summer's gone to its silent tomb, stilling in Her cold embrace.
> 
> All the world in winter's white, sheathed in sleet and ice. Set upon never-ending night, She conjures paradise.
> 
> Behold Her everlasting rime, see how it covers all; Weep not for those She traps in time behind Her glacial wall.
> 
> Sovereign of summers lost, general of winter's war; Long live the queen of cold and frost. May She reign forevermore.
