# Starting the Adventure
*Source: X Marks the Spot, p. 3* 

Once the players have chosen characters, you are ready to begin. Read the following text to set up the scenario and the bargain the characters have made for their freedom.

> Your time in the prison cells of Conqueror's Foothold is drawing to an end—as are your lives. Like all those deemed enemies of the Legion of Dusk, you are set to be executed to feed the vampires who command the fortress. On the night before the full moon, you have been moved to the executioner's chamber, next in line to be sacrificed.

> But what your captors don't know is that each of you has made a bargain with the cleric, Alante. In exchange for your lives and retrieval of the legendary relic known as the Hierophant's Chalice, you have been promised various favors from the Order of the Five Sacraments—a vampiric sect that opposes the Legion of Dusk's thirst for conquest. During your brief time in Conqueror's Foothold, Alante has been able to communicate a plan of escape by sending message spells at various interludes. Tonight marks the night that plan comes to fruition.
^007

## The Great Escape

Read the following to set up the characters' escape from the forces of the Legion of Dusk:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> You stand in a large holding cell awaiting the executioner's summons. Outside the cell window, a nearly full moon hangs high in the cloudless sky. In the center of the executioner's chamber, a greataxe lies across a stone block. Chains lined with butcher hooks hang above metal vats stacked and waiting to collect the blood of the executed, and reminding you of your imminent appointment with death.
> 
> The guards open the metal grate that seals your cell. Stepping into the chamber beyond, you see the cleric who will oversee your sacrifice. That's your cue. It's time to issue last rites. . . to the guards.
^009

The characters have no gear, except for Alante. They are unarmored and can make only unarmed strikes, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + Strength modifier.

The Legion of Dusk troops stationed at Conqueror's Foothold are loyal to Vona, Butcher of Magan. Two human [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) have escorted the cleric Alante into the cell. One guard carries a set of keys that can be used to open the prison cells, the main door, and the executioner's hatch (see below). The perimeter of the room is lined with five other cell blocks, each large enough to hold five prisoners but empty at present.

Only one door leads out of the executioner's chamber. Alante, Turk, and Ellie know that no prisoner has ever successfully escaped from Conqueror's Foothold, and that to go through that door means a vicious fight against dozens of guards, and no guarantee of finding an exit

### The Executioner's Hatch

In one corner of the chamber, a padlocked lever stands next to a three-foot-square metal grate. If the lever is unlocked (either with the key carried by the guard or a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md)), it can be pulled to drop the grate open. This reveals the executioner's hatch—a chute down which bodies are dumped into the ocean after they are drained of life by the vampires in the fort.

A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notes that the slick walls of the chute offer no handholds. This makes it a straight drop into the ocean, and prevents anyone from getting back up this way. Characters who jump through the hatch take no damage when they hit the water, and can then easily swim to shore.

One hour after the characters escape, a new group of guards enters the executioner's block and sounds an alert (see "Conqueror's Foothold," below).

Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check notices a [hunter shark](/compendium/bestiary/beast/hunter-shark.md) in the water. Any party member who takes damage during the fight with the guards attracts its attention and causes the shark to attack.

## Conqueror's Foothold

When the characters reach the beach in the shadow of the fortress, read:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The bastioned fortification of Conqueror's Foothold towers high above the sheer cliff side. Waves crash along the rocky shoreline, their caps lit by moonlight.
^00d

Artinoq's raptor companion, Sharkbait, waits on the beach with a rucksack containing ten days' [rations](/compendium/items/rations-1-day.md). Once he sees his companion, he leads the party to a hidden cache buried in the sand, which contains all their confiscated gear. Alante managed to smuggle it out of the fortress a few days ago.

To the north, a trail leads to the Field of Ruin. Following this path through to the northwest mountain passage will take the characters through the Primal Wellspring region, bypassing the strongholds of the Legion of Dusk.

Those strongholds—Fort Leor and Fort Durron—lie to the west. A well-used path makes travel along that route easier, but the area is often patrolled by soldiers of the Legion of Dusk.

Regardless of which route the characters take, they must venture through Unclaimed Territory before making their way to the Temple of Aclazotz.

### Discovery and Pursuit

One hour after the characters fought the guards, another patrol enters the executioner's chamber and discovers the escape. A bell-toll alarm sounds out within the fort, and a patrol of twelve [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) is sent out to comb the area for the prisoners and the duplicitous Alante. Additionally, beacon towers between Conqueror's Foothold, Fort Leor, and Fort Durron light up, making it difficult for characters who are not with the Legion of Dusk to move along the beach unseen. Any Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made by the characters to avoid guards are made with disadvantage.

Two hours after the escape, Vona discovers that Alante is attempting to claim the _Hierophant's Chalice_ before he does. The Butcher of Magan assembles a force and sends them out to find the relic first. Vona's relic hunters are comprised of two vampire soldiers (use [guard](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) statistics), a human cleric (use [priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) statistics), and a human [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), all on horseback. They take the most direct route to the Temple of Aclazotz, past Fort Leor and Fort Durron across the beach. However, they subsequently become lost in the Unclaimed Territory, and can be randomly encountered there.

### Danger on the Beach

If the characters continue along the shoreline, they come upon the wreckage of numerous ships. Among the dead is the orc Captain Beelzebufo from the pirate ship Relentless, on which both Ellie and Turk served. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notes that the orc appears to have died from stab wounds rather than by drowning.

Any character surveilling the area closely with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices movement in the waves.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Rising from the surf, skeletons dressed in tattered clothes of pirates shamble toward the shore!
^011

The six [skeletons](/compendium/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) attack, gaining surprise if all the characters fail to notice them.

> [!quote] Exploring Ixalan
> 
> Traveling from Conqueror's Foothold to the Temple of Aclazotz takes three days by way of the beach or four days through the mountains. While moving through certain terrain (Fort Leor and Fort Durron, Primal Wellspring, and Uncharted Territory), random encounters might be triggered. Roll a d20 to check for an encounter once during the day and once during the night. If the result is 18 or higher by day, or 15 or higher at night, a random encounter occurs. Refer to the encounter tables in each region to determine what the adventurers meet, and reroll if the result doesn't make sense given the circumstances.

## Field of Ruin

It takes four hours to reach this area from Conqueror's Foothold.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Dozens upon dozens of bodies are strewn about the field in various states of decomposition. The ruined banners of fallen war parties billow in the sea breeze.
^014

The characters can follow a river north to a mountain passage through the Primal Wellspring. To the south is the shoreline. Fort Leor and Fort Durron are to the west, within sight of the beach.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check reveals the presence of scavengers in the field. Three medium raptors (use [deinonychus](/compendium/bestiary/beast/deinonychus-mpmm.md) statistics) feast on corpses to the west. If the characters notice the raptors, they can attempt a group [Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth) check against the creatures' passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) of 13. On a failed group check, or if the characters don't notice the raptors, the raptors spot the party and attack.

### Random Encounters

If the party travels along the shore near the forts, use the following table if a random encounter is rolled.

**Shoreline Encounters**

| 1d6 | Encounter |
|-----|-----------|
| 1 | A 20-foot-deep hidden {@trap pit trap|xge} is noticed only with a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. The trap fires a flare when triggered, summoning a nearby patrol of 2d6 guards to investigate. |
| 2 | 1d6 trilobites (use [giant crab](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-crab.md) statistics) |
| 3 | A worn jade totem is etched with a warning in Primordial: _"No good will come from what you seek. Turn back now or suffer an ignoble death far from your home."_ |
| 4 | An area of {@trap quicksand|dmg} cannot be detected until one or more characters steps within it. The quicksand is 10 feet deep, and any creature that steps into it sinks 1d4 + 1 feet, then sinks 1d4 feet at the start of each of its turns. A successful Strength check (DC 10 + the number of feet sunk) allows a character to escape the quicksand. A rope thrown by an ally to the struggling creature grants advantage on the check. Any creature completely submerged begins to suffocate. |
| 5 | 2d4 raptors (use [velociraptor](/compendium/bestiary/beast/velociraptor-mpmm.md) statistics) |
| 6 | The characters discover a treasure cache. All characters with a Treasure token card have a contest of Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)), with the character with the highest check trading the token for a card from the hidden plunder. |
^shoreline-encounters

If the party travels through the interior to avoid the forts, use the following table if a random encounter is rolled.

**Interior Encounters**

| 1d4 | Encounter |
|-----|-----------|
| 1 | 2d6 skittering heartstoppers (use [giant centipede](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-centipede.md) statistics) |
| 2 | The characters discover a treasure cache. All characters with a Treasure token card have a contest of Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)), with the character with the highest check trading the token for a card from the hidden plunder. |
| 3 | 1d4 aerosaurs (use [quetzalcoatlus](/compendium/bestiary/beast/quetzalcoatlus-mpmm.md) statistics) |
| 4 | 1d4 ferocidons (use [allosaurus](/compendium/bestiary/beast/allosaurus.md) statistics) |
^interior-encounters

## Fort Leor and Fort Durron

A simple structure surrounded by a wooden palisade, Fort Leor is the nearest fortress to Conqueror's Foothold. It takes one day to travel for the characters to arrive here.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Fort Leor stands in the middle of the beach, alongside a river that winds down from the northern mountains to empty into the ocean. Surrounded by a wooden palisade, armed patrols march along the fort's parapet walls.
^018

Fort Durron, near the Temple of Aclazotz, is a stronghold isolated on an island and home to the armada of the Legion of Dusk. It takes one day to travel here from Fort Leor.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Fort Durron rises tall on an island to the south. Another bastioned fortress, not unlike Conqueror's Foothold, its looming presence in the distance is made even more ominous by the Dusk Legion dreadnought moored at its stone pier.
^019

### Avoiding Notice

The characters must pass near each fort. They can use magic or attempt a group Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check (DC 15 to succeed during the day, DC 10 to succeed at night) to travel unseen. At either fort, if the characters are spotted, a patrol of twelve [guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) mounted on [riding horses](/compendium/bestiary/beast/riding-horse.md) moves to intercept. The guards ask the characters their reasons for traveling through the area, and if not convinced by their story, move to attack and apprehend them.

## Primal Wellspring

It takes two days to reach this area from the Field of Ruin.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Following the natural path up through mountainous terrain, you eventually make your way down again, moving through a lush canopy of vines into a vivid jungle. Ahead of you, a waterfall erupts from a great stone sculpture jutting out from the side of a cliff, sourced by a powerful spring.
^01d

The area around the waterfall spring is covered in thick foliage and tangles of vines, making it difficult terrain. Because there is no natural path through this region, the party's navigator must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to find the way through to the next region. If the party is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus to the check, while a fast pace imposes a −5 penalty. The party's navigator can repeat the check after the party spends 1d6 hours trying to get back on course.

### Lurking Threat

Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check notes movement beneath the water's surface, masked by the splash of the waterfall. The Primal Wellspring is home to a snapping sailback (use [giant crocodile](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md) statistics).

Disturbing the spring in any manner results in attracting the attention of the creature, which attacks immediately.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The gaping maw of an enormous breast surfaces from the pool, its giant red fin sluicing water across the shore.
^020

## Unclaimed Territory

It takes one day to reach this area from Fort Durron or the Primal Wellspring.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The mist of the mountains clears to reveal a rainforest. The tall trees and foliage around you are alive with movement, and macaws and parrots sing a cacophonous tune.
^022

### An Unlikely Ally

Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check while moving within the Unclaimed Territory determines that the party is being followed. In response to being spotted (or at any opportune moment), a vampire cleric named Mavren reveals himself to the characters (use [cult fanatic](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) statistics).

By all outward appearances, Mavren has gone mad. A tall figure with dark hair, sunken eyes, and pallid skin, he is an apostle of the prophet Arguel, and wears the tattered robes of the clergy of the Legion of Dusk. But unknown to the characters, Mavren is secretly under the control of a demon named Zotz—the spawn of a dread bat-god.

Mavren knows the following information, which he shares in the course of any conversation with the characters:

- The prophet Arguel had a vision that led him into the jungles of Ixalan with the Hierophant's Chalice.
- The Temple of Aclazotz is hidden in the nearby jungle, four hours away.
- A murderous creature lurks around the temple, known to Mavren as "the night horror."

Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Insight](/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check determines that Mavren believes he's working for some higher purpose, but that he is also hiding something. If a  character succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check after pressing Mavren, the cleric reveals through his ravings that the Temple of Aclazotz is the home of his demonic master.

Mavren can lead the party directly to the Temple of Aclazotz. If the characters decline his aid, the party's navigator must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to find the way to the temple. If the party is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gains a +5 bonus to the check, while a fast pace imposes a −5 penalty. The party's navigator can repeat the check after the party spends 1d6 hours trying to get back on course.

### Random Encounters

As the party travels through the Unclaimed Territory, use the following table if a random encounter is rolled.

**Unclaimed Territory Encounters**

| 1d6 | Encounter |
|-----|-----------|
| 1 | 2d4 [frilled deathspitters](/compendium/bestiary/beast/frilled-deathspitter-psx.md) |
| 2 | 1 [dryad](/compendium/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) and 1d12 [awakened shrubs](/compendium/bestiary/plant/awakened-shrub.md) |
| 3 | Vona's relic hunters: 2 vampire soldiers ([guards](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md)), 1 human cleric ([priest](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md)), 1 human [scout](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) |
| 4 | The characters discover a treasure cache. All characters with a Treasure token card have a contest of Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)), with the character with the highest check trading the token for a card from the hidden plunder. |
| 5 | 1 [griffon](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) |
| 6 | 1 wildgrowth walker (use [earth elemental](/compendium/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) statistics) |
^unclaimed-territory-encounters

## Temple of Aclazotz

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Nearly hidden by the jungle, a stone temple is overgrown with vines. Its broad steps lead up to a darkened entrance, and are caked with a red-black substance. Absolute silence hangs in the area around the temple, as though the site is devoid of life.
^027

Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals the substance on the steps to be blood. It is impossible to determine how many bodies have been dragged into this temple.

### The Night Horror

If Marven led the adventurers here, he urges them to enter quickly, before they wake the creature that lurks in the area.

The creatures mutts succeed on a DC 15 group Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to pass undetected by this [chupacabra](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/chupacabra-psx.md), which attacks if it senses any intrusion into its territory. Marven abandons and retreats into the temple if the characters are attacked.

### Arguel's End

The interior of the temple is a single chamber with a ceiling thirty feet high. It is unlit, and characters must use light or have [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) to explore.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The trail from the steps leads into a stone chamber. A strong stench fills the air and the temperature is significantly cooler here than it was outside in the humidity of the rainforest. In the center of the chamber stands a lone altar, upon which lies a corpse.
^02b

Creatures who move within ten feet of the altar note that the corpse is little more than a dessicated husk. It wears the robes of a marshal from the Legion of Dusk and holds an ornate silver goblet in its hands.

Any creature who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [History](/rules/skills.md#History)) check recognizes the remains as those of Arguel, the prophet rumored to have brought the _Hierophant's Chalice_ to the temple. A source of endless blood, the chalice activates when a single drop of blood is placed within it, filling to the brim with sanguineous fluid.

### Demonic Guardians

Hanging from the ceiling above the altar are four blight keepers (use [giant bat](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-bat.md) statistics) and a demon named Zotz (use [vrock](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md) statistics). If Mavren fled from the chupacabra attack, he alerts Zotz, his demonic master, of the party's presence outside. Otherwise, if the characters arrive by day, they find the creatures sleeping and can surprise them if they attack at once and make no loud noise. At night, the characters must succeed on a DC 10 group Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to enter the temple undetected and get the drop on the demon and its minions.

The spawn of a forgotten bat-god, the demon Zotz means to spread plague and corruption across Ixalan. He has long used his influence upon the insane Mavren to bring prey to the temple. Seeing how the _Hierophant's Chalice_ could be used as a means to broker peace between the Legion of Dusk and the local inhabitants by reducing the need for blood sacrifices, Zotz protects the item and attempts to corrupt it with his demonic essence.

Mavren aids his master in combat. If he survives after Zotz is defeated, the cleric is no longer under the sway of the demon, but he remembers and is haunted by all the horrible things he's done in Zotz's name.
