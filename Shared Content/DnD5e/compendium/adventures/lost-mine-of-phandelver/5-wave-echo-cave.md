# Wave Echo Cave
*Source: Lost Mine of Phandelver, p. 42* 

Fifteen miles east of Phandalin, in the deep vales of the Sword Mountains, lies Wave Echo Cave. The rich mine of the Phandelver's Pact was lost five hundred years ago during orc invasions that devastated this part of the North.

In the centuries since, countless prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost mine, but none succeeded until the Rockseeker brothers found the entrance a month ago. Unfortunately, the Rockseekers did not realize they were being trailed by spies working for Nezznar, the Black Spider, and they inadvertently led the drow villain to their prize. Nezznar and his followers dealt with the two Rockseekers who were guarding their find, then arranged for Gundren's ambush. Learning of the adventurers' involvement with Gundren or their exploits in and around Phandalin, the Black Spider has given orders for the characters to be dealt with. Meanwhile, Nezznar has begun his exploration of Wave Echo Cave.

The drow is searching for the Forge of Spells, where the human mages of old Phandalin enchanted dwarven weapons and gnome gadgets. However, Nezznar's exploration has been hindered by the restless undead and dangerous monsters that lurk in Wave Echo Cave, forcing him to proceed with great caution.

The adventurers now have the chance to aid Gundren, avenge his kin, and put a stop to the nefarious schemes of the Black Spider. And of course, the hoard of powerful magic rumored to be hidden in the mines is a rich prize.

## Character Level

This part of the adventure is designed for characters of at least 4th level and assumes that each character has earned at least 2,700 XP. If the adventurers skipped too many of the optional investigations and encounters in part 3, they might not be 4th level, and many of the encounters in this section might be difficult for them.

## Experience Point Awards

In this part of the adventure, XP is awarded for overcoming monsters, as in parts 2 and 3. However, XP awards for monsters is not given in the encounter description. Instead, the amount of XP that a monster is worth is noted in us stat block. You calculate the award by totaling the value for each monster the characters overcome. Additional XP awards, and the reasons for them, are described in the text, under the "Awarding Experience Points" heading.

## Wandering Monsters

Monsters roam through all areas of the mine. Random encounters remind players that monsters aren't necessarily confined to specific areas, and that no part of the dungeon is safe. Encounters with wandering monsters are an effective way to keep the players and characters on their toes, alleviate player boredom, and tax party resources. However, having too many random encounters can become tedious, so use them sparingly.

If the characters spend a long time in a given area, you can check for wandering monsters by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17-20, an encounter takes place. Conversely, if the players seem restless, you can decide that an encounter occurs. Roll a d12 and consult the Wandering Monsters table to determine what the party meets.

## General Features

The mine is cold, damp, and surprisingly drafty. A noticeable breeze blows through many of its passages, flowing from 1 toward 16.

### Ceilings

Tunnels are 10 feet high unless noted otherwise. Rooms have 20-foot-high ceilings, while natural caverns have 30-foot-high ceilings dotted with stalactites.

### Doors

Unless noted otherwise, all doors are 6 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and made of six-inch-thick cut slabs of stone fitted with iron handles and hinges. The doors are low and wide—perfect for dwarves.

### Walls

The walls are hewn stone. In a few areas (14, 15, 19, and 20), they are dressed with well-fitted stone blocks.

### Floors

All floors are smooth, natural stone.

### Light

None unless otherwise indicated. The boxed text assumes that the characters have light sources or [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision).

### Stalagmites

Found in many of the natural caverns, these spires of rock rise up from the floor and can be used for cover (see "Cover" in the rulebook).

### Keyed Encounters

All the encounters in this part of the adventure are keyed to the map of Wave Echo Cave.

### Booming Waves

All good dungeons have characteristics that make them unique, and Wave Echo Cave is no exception. The rhythmic thunder of pounding waves echoes throughout the mine, loud enough to make the stone underfoot shiver. Waves come about two minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast.

Wave Echo Cave is nowhere near the ocean, but a water-filled cavern deep in the mine is connected to an underground hot spring. That spring boils over continuously to produce a surge that slams into a narrow funnel, making a sound like breaking surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion. It will pique their curiosity and lure them toward its source, drawing them deeper into the mine as a consequence.

## 1. Cave Entrance

Whether the characters follow Gundren's map or receive directions to Wave Echo Cave from another source, their initial approach leads them to a narrow tunnel whose entrance is hidden within the Sword Mountain foothills.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The entrance tunnel leads into a large cavern supported by a natural pillar of rock and containing three stalagmites. In the western part of the cave, behind the column of rock, are three bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies—sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.
> 
> The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down the side of the pit, at the bottom of which is a rough-hewn tunnel heading northwest and east.
^159

This was the campsite of the Rockseekers. The dead dwarf is Tharden, Gundren's brother, who was killed by the Black Spider. Gundren's other brother, Nundro, was here as well and is currently the Black Spider's prisoner in 20.

The dwarves' supplies are potentially useful, but not particularly valuable.

### Open Pit

Climbing up or down the wall of the pit without a rope requires a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A character who fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) at the bottom. The tunnel at the bottom of the pit leads northwest toward 2 and east toward 3.

### Treasure

Tharden wears a pair of [boots of striding and springing](/compendium/items/boots-of-striding-and-springing.md). In his haste to explore the rest of Wave Echo Cave, Nezznar overlooked them.

## 2. Mine Tunnels

This maze of passages is an old section of Wave Echo Cave's original mine site.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This area consists of numerous intersecting passages. The ceilings here are only six feet high, and several of the passages end in partially excavated rock faces.
^15d

The dead-end passages are places where the miners gave up and decided to move on to other spots. Patiently lurking in one is an [ochre jelly](/compendium/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md). When the party enters this section of the mine, the jelly begins to stalk the group, instinctively waiting for an opportunity to attack a lone target.

## 3. Old Entrance

The tunnel that runs south was the original entrance to Wave Echo Cave, but it was buried by the destruction that wracked the mines centuries ago. A pitched battle was fought here when the orcs stormed the mines. The dead still lie where they fell.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Many tunnels intersect at this natural, thirty-foot-high cavern. The walls are carved with simple reliefs showing dwarf and gnome miners hard at work. Below them, nearly two dozen skeletons in rusted scraps of armor are scattered across the cavern floor. Some are dwarf skeletons, while others are orc remains. Half a dozen large brass lanterns stand in niches or on ledges around the cavern, but none are lit.
^15f

Clinging to the ceiling like bats are ten [stirges](/compendium/bestiary/beast/stirge.md). The monsters find scant living prey in the mines, and they are ravenous. If the characters are looking down at the skeletons on the floor, the stirges are likely get the drop on them. Any character who isn't watching the ceiling is surprised unless his or her passive Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score is higher than the stirges' Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check total (roll once for all of them). Characters who aren't surprised hear a flapping noise as the stirges descend to attack.

The lanterns and the carvings of miners at work were meant as a welcome to newcomers.

## 4. Old Guardroom

This guardroom once protected the nearby entrance to the mine, but it was overrun early in the fighting when the orcs attacked.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Splintered stone benches and heaps of rubble from a partially collapsed ceiling fill this room. Amid ruined stone bunks and toppled weapon racks are the bones of several dwarves and orcs.
^161

In the round after any living creature enters this chamber, the bones begin to stir and knit together, forming nine [skeletons](/compendium/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md). They fight until destroyed.

## 5. Assayers' Office

The mine's assayers worked here, weighing and assessing ore samples and paying the minors for their labor.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This chamber was once an office or storeroom of some kind. A large stone counter bisects the room, set with three dusty balance scales made of iron. Cubbyholes carved into the north wall are stuffed with dusty paper scraps. Several long-dead corpses—gnomes and orcs by their look—are sprawled across the floor.
^163

The centuries-old paper in the cubbyholes disintegrates if touched, but a character who reads Dwarvish can see faint markings on a few scraps, recording weigh-ins and disbursements.

### Treasure

Behind the counter sits a locked iron strongbox, requiring [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check to open. This pay chest was overlooked in the fighting and contains 600 cp, 180 sp, 90 ep, and 60 gp.

## 6. South Barracks

This was a miners' barracks, where the skilled delvers working in Wave Echo Cave rested between shifts. Any character who listens at the partially open door hears faint crunching and splintering sounds with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Old stone bunks in orderly rows line the walls of this chamber, and a corroded iron brazier full of old coals stands near the middle of the room. The bones of a half dozen dwarves and orcs lie strewn about, clad in scraps of armor. Three gray, hunched figures squat among the remains, pawing at the scraps and gnawing on the bones.
^166

Three [ghouls](/compendium/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) from the pack in 9 are here, cracking and gnawing on the ancient bones of the fallen in the vain hope that some tasty morsel of marrow remains. The ghouls, eager for a fresh meal, attack immediately.

## 7. Ruined Storeroom

Despite the destruction all around, the northern part of this storage area has survived intact.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> The eastern wall of this chamber has collapsed into a mass of rubble. To the north, a door stands ajar, leading to a good-sized storeroom. Dusty kegs are tucked neatly against the walls, all of them cracked and split open from age.
^168

It's not comfortable, but the storeroom is a secure resting place. No monsters come this way. Moreover, the storeroom door is in good shape and can easily be blocked or barred from the inside.

The contents of the kegs have long evaporated.

## 8. Fungi Cavern

This cave has hindered Nezznar's explorations. The drow suspects that the mine's magic workshops are close by, but he's reluctant to risk dealing with the monsters here.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Dense carpets of weird fungi cover large sections of the floor in this cavern. The growth includes puffballs a foot across, weird shelf fungus growing on stalagmites, and large stalks and caps a good five feet tall. Some of the puffballs glow with an eerie green phosphorescence.
^16a

Most of the fungi is harmless, and the green-glowing fungi allow creatures to see the entire cavern without the aid of [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) or a light source.

### Poison Gas

Whenever a creature attempts to cross the cavern, the carpets of fungi that cover most of the floor release poisonous gas into the air. Each creature in the cavern must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage and be [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 10 minutes (see the rulebook for more information on the [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition). The gas disperses after 1 minute, but until then, any living creature that ends its turn in the cavern must repeat the saving throw.

## 9. Great Cavern

This cave once served as the banquet room, meeting area, and mead hall for the miners.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Steep escarpments divide this large cavern into three sections—high ledges at either end, and a lower section in the middle. Carved stone stairs climb up to the ledges. Two large tables stand in the middle section, along with a pair of old braziers. A smaller table stands on the eastern ledge. The skeletal remains of dozens of dead warriors—dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and ogres—attest to the fierceness of the fighting that took place here long ago.
^16d

Seven [ghouls](/compendium/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) lurk in the shadows on the western ledge.

They notice any light or noise elsewhere in the cave and quickly bound down to attack. The undead are hungry and fight until destroyed.

The escarpments are 10 feet high and require a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to climb. A creature that falls or is knocked from the top of a ledge takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and lands [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## 10. Dark Pool

Treasure is concealed in this water-filled cave.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A still pool fills much of this cavern. The water is dark, revealing little of what might lie within. The shore of the pool consists of a thin layer of broken shells from strange, pale mussels, and a fishy odor hangs in the air.
> 
> A passage leads south from this area, and a set of steps climbs up to the east. A sluggish stream flows out of the cave to the northeast.
^16f

The pool is 20 feet deep in the middle. The stream to the northeast is 3 feet deep, and the ceiling of the passage is 2 to 3 feet above the water. Characters can easily wade through the stream to 18.

A character who explores the pool finds an old skeleton lying on the bottom, 10 feet from the shore and under 10 feet of water. These are the remains of a human wizard from old Phandalin who died defending the mines against the orc attackers. Several orc arrows are still lodged in the skeleton's ribcage.

### Treasure

The skeleton wears two platinum rings (75 gp each) and clutches a [wand of magic missiles](/compendium/items/wand-of-magic-missiles.md) in its bony fingers.

## 11. North Barracks

The eastern door is barricaded from inside the room and requires a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open. A character who listens at either door and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check hears gruff voices speaking Goblin and talking about how hungry they are.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Old stone bunks line the walls of this barracks, which is lit and heated by a glowing iron brazier in the middle of the room.
^172

If the party enters from the west, add:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Across the room is another door, this one blocked by a barricade made from the remains of a wooden table.
^173

Five [bugbears](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md) reside in this chamber. They are loyal minions of Nezznar. This room marks the front line in the Black Spider's assault on Wave Echo Cave, and the bugbears are here to prevent ghouls, zombies, or other undead from troubling their master in his lair (19).

Like 6, this was formerly a barracks for miners. Nezznar's bugbears removed the corpses they found here and built the barricade.

### Treasure

The largest bugbear carries a pouch containing 15 cp. 13ep, and a [potion of vitality](/compendium/items/potion-of-vitality.md).

## 12. Smelter Cavern

Like the fungi cavern at 8, this chamber poses a serious obstacle that prevents Nezznar from reaching his objective—the Forge of Spells (15). The drow is still formulating a plan to get past the undead guardians in this area.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A blast furnace and a mechanical bellows powered by a waterwheel dominate this large chamber. The furnace is cold and dark, but heaps of coal are piled nearby, along with carts full of unrefined ore. The waterwheel sits in a ten-foot-wide channel cut into the floor of the room, but the channel is dry. Passages exit to the west, south, and east. The empty channel exits to the north and east.
> 
> More than a dozen withered corpses are scattered around the room. These slain dwarves and orcs are still wearing the remnants of their armor. Floating above them is a skull engulfed in green flame.
^176

Eight of the fallen dwarf warriors are [zombies](/compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md). They rise and pursue any living creatures that enter the room, but they do not pursue creatures outside this area for more than 1 round. In addition, a far more intelligent undead guards this area: a [flameskull](/compendium/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md). This creature was a servant of the human wizards allied with the Phandelver dwarves and gnomes, and it continues to act on ancient instructions to prevent intruders from passing through.

This impressive chamber was the heart of the Wave Echo Cave mining operation. Here, the dwarves melted down their ore to refine ingots of silver, gold, and platinum. The dry channel is where the dwarves diverted the stream from 18 to power the waterwheel here. That in turn operated the bellows that fed the furnace.

The channel's bottom is 5 feet below floor level, and no ability check is required to scramble in or out. Characters in the channel can follow it out of this room to the north or to the east, though the ceiling is only 5 feet high after the channel exits this room.

## 13. Starry Cavern

The structural damage and the skeletal remains in this area are evidence of the destructive spell battle fought here centuries ago when the arcs and their mercenary wizards stormed the mines.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Glittering minerals in the ceiling of this large cavern catch the light and send it back to create the impression of a starry night sky. Dozens of skeletons—many crushed under fallen debris—are scattered across the floor.
> 
> The cave is large enough that it contains two freestanding structures. Each of these stone buildings is proportioned for human use, as opposed to the dwarf-sized doorways and furnishings you've seen elsewhere in the mines. Both structures have battered and blackened masonry walls, their double doors cracked and scorched. The cavern is divided by an escarpment, into which a flight of stairs has been cut.
> 
> Passages lead out of this area to the north, south, and west.
^178

The damaged buildings are described in areas 14 and 15. Minerals in the ceiling are pretty, but they are neither magical nor valuable.

Any character proficient in [Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) can sense a subtle aura of magic in this cavern. (A [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals the same.) The aura becomes stronger as one approaches the northern building (15).

## 14. Wizards' Quarters

The doors leading into this area are cracked, their iron hinges partially melted. Wrenching or smashing open the doors requires a successful DC 15 Strength check.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Dust, ash, walls blackened by fire, and heaps of debris beneath the sagging ceiling show that this room was damaged by a destructive blast. The furnishings—tables, chairs, bookshelves, beds—are charred or splintered, but otherwise well preserved. A scorched iron chest stands near the foot of one of the beds.
^17a

This room contains the restless spirit of the last wizard to die here: [Mormesk the wraith](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mormesk-the-wraith-lmop.md). He is not immediately visible but rises up out of the floor when a living creature enters the room.

Mormesk was a powerful mage until he met his end in the spell battle at the climax of the orc attack. Centuries of anger have [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) his soul, transforming him into a hate-filled apparition.

Mormesk leads the undead that haunt Wave Echo Cave. The wraith spends his time here because the treasure he had amassed in life is in the scorched chest (see the "Treasure" section). No longer corporeal, he cannot touch or possess the wealth he enjoyed in life.

This building served as a guesthouse for visiting wizards working in the Forge of Spells (15), most of whom were humans from nearby cities. The furnishings are all human proportioned.

### Roleplaying Mormesk

Mormesk speaks in grave whispers. When the wraith first rises up from the floor, it says, "Your presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!" If the characters make no attempt to reason with the wraith, it attacks.

If the characters try to reason with the wraith, it listens to what they have to say, provided they have not harmed it in any way or seized any of its property. The wraith is irrevocably evil, so the only way the characters can stay its spectral hand is to offer it something a former wizard would consider valuable in exchange for their lives. Mormesk values magic items (particularly scrolls), spellbooks, and arcane knowledge. Whatever the gift, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma ([Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to convince the wraith of its value.

Regardless of what the characters offer it, the wraith won't relinquish the wooden pipe in the scorched chest. It will, however, part with the coins and gems if the characters agree to kill the spectator in the Forge of Spells. (The wraith doesn't explain what a spectator is. It merely points toward 15.) Once it receives its gift, the wraith allows characters to peruse its books and keep the secret map in one of them (see the "Treasure" section).

### Treasure

The scorched chest is unlocked and contains 1,100 cp, 160 sp, 50 ep, three diamonds (100 gp each), and a wooden pipe adorned with platinum filigree (150 gp).

A handful of magically preserved tomes remain on the shelves. Most are just histories, but one has a map sewn into its cover. The map's presence can be discerned with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. The map shows the location of a dungeon of your own creation. When the characters finish their explorations here, this old map can lead them to their next adventure.

## 15. Forge of Spells

Here is where the wizards allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact channeled the magic of these caverns to enchant dwarven arms and gnome gadgets. The northernmost door is scorched and cracked, its iron hinges partially melted; forcing it open requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. The western double doors are just as damaged but stand slightly ajar.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This large workshop was badly damaged by the ancient spell battle that laid waste to the mine. Worktables taking up two corners of the room are scorched, and the plaster has been burned off the masonry walls. In the middle of the room, a stone pedestal holds a small brazier in which an eerie green flame dances and crackles. The brazier and its pedestal appear to have been untouched by the forces that destroyed this area.
> 
> Behind the brazier of green flame floats a spherical creature measuring roughly four feet in diameter. Four eyestalks protrude from its central mass, two on each side. In the center of the body is a large eye that stares at you. "Hello," says a thick, burbling voice inside your head.
^17e

The monster that guards this room is a [spectator](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/spectator.md). One of the human wizards who worked in the Forge of Spells summoned the creature to guard the magic items created and stored here. When the mine was sacked, the orcs disturbed the delicate magic in the area, unhinging the spectator's grip on reality. It has become deranged and believes that the mine is still in use, ignoring all evidence to the contrary.

The wraith (14) wants to drive off or kill the spectator, but so far, the creature has easily handled the assaults of Mormesk's zombies and ghouls while seeing nothing strange about undead roaming the mine. If the party attempts to remove anything from this area, the spectator attacks. If the spectator is [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded) somehow, it disappears back to its home plane, convinced that it can no longer perform the task for which it was summoned.

With a successful DC 15 Charisma ([Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check, a character can trick the spectator into thinking one or more party members are wizards or miners who work for the owners of Wave Echo Cave, sent to terminate the spectator's employment. If the deception succeeds, the spectator believes it is released from its obligations, and it disappears and returns to its home plane.

### Brazier of Green Flame

A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check identifies the brazier as the source of the magic that suffuses the surrounding caverns. This magic has waned over the years, to the extent that it can no longer be harnessed to permanently enchant magic items. However, any nonmagical weapon or armor bathed in the green flame for at least 1 minute becomes a +1 weapon or +1 armor, respectively, for 1d12 hours. The brazier cannot be removed from the Forge of Spells.

### Northern Room

This small room is a separate workspace, where items being prepared for enchantment were polished, lacquered, and otherwise finished. Like the main workshop, it has been almost completely destroyed.

### Treasure

On the worktable in the southeast corner of the room are the last items the spectator was charged to protect: [Lightbringer](/compendium/items/lightbringer-lmop.md) and [Dragonguard](/compendium/items/dragonguard-lmop.md).

## 16. Booming Cavern

The sound of pounding surf that gives Wave Echo Cave its name can be traced to this water-filled cavern.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A narrow ledge overlooks a large cavern that houses a surging, seething body of water. The rhythmic booming heard throughout the mines is louder here. At regular intervals, a fresh surge of water funnels into this chamber and slams against the wall just below the ledge. The echo suggests that this cave might be one arm of a much larger cavern to the northeast.
^183

The ledge that hugs the south wall is 15 feet above water level. However, when water surges into the cave every 2 minutes, it raises the water level by 10 feet. After a minute, the water level returns to its normal depth of 20 feet.

## 17. Old Streambed

The stream flowing from 10 to 18 used to continue through this low passage, eventually emptying out into 16.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> This passageway is barely four feet high and is obstructed by rounded boulders and pebbles. It might have been a streambed, though no water flows here now.
^185

The dwarves diverted the stream into the channel leading to 12 to drive the waterwheel in the smelter. Then the earthquakes that rocked Wave Echo Cave during the final spell battle of the orc invasion collapsed the floor in 18, diverting the stream once again. The old streambed remains as a usable passage that circumvents the undead in 12, although Nezznar has not yet discovered this.

## 18. Collapsed Cavern

Nezznar's servants occupy this cavern, guarding against undead incursions and carefully sifting through the rubble. The Black Spider's divinations suggest that some valuable treasure is hidden at the bottom of the rift that was created when this area was destroyed.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> A wide rift fills the eastern half of this cavern. A stream pours out of the west wall, then tumbles down into the rift and flows out again to the north. Several ropes are secured to iron stakes along on the western edge of the rift, leading down to the chasm floor.
^187

Three [bugbears](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md) are stationed here. Two of them are clearing rock on the rift floor while one more stands guard in the western half of the cavern. A [doppelganger](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) named Vhalak supervises the operation in the guise of a male drow. If a fight breaks out in the main cavern, the two bugbears in the rift climb up the ropes to join the fray.

### Rift

The rift is 20 feet deep. Climbing up or down without using a rope requires a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A creature that fails the check by 5 or more falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) at the bottom.

### Developments

If two or more bugbears are killed, the doppelganger tries to retreat to 19 to warn Nezznar.

### Treasure

Nezznar's divinations are accurate. Buried under heavy rubble at the bottom of the rift is the crushed skeleton of a dwarf wearing [gauntlets of ogre power](/compendium/items/gauntlets-of-ogre-power.md). The remains are hidden from view but can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. Each character searching can attempt one check per hour.

## 19. Temple of Dumathoin

Nezznar uses this room as his headquarters while he explores the mines and searches for the Forge of Spells.

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Six cracked marble pillars line the walls of this hall, at the north end of which stands a nine-foot-tall statue of a dwarf seated on a throne, a mighty stone warhammer across his lap. Large emeralds gleam in the statue's eyes.
> 
> The dust and debris covering the floor has been swept to one side, and a campsite of sorts now spreads in front of the statue. Half a dozen bedrolls and packs are neatly arranged around a rough-built fire pit. A wooden table stands on the west side of the room between two pillars.
^18c

If the room's occupants are not aware of the characters as they enter, add the following:

> [!quote] ...
> 
> Two bugbears stand by the table, flanking a dark elf dressed in black leather armor and robes. He clutches a black staff with a carved spider at the top and frowns as he sees you. "It seems that I must deal with you myself. A pity it must end this way."

[Nezznar the Black Spider](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nezznar-the-black-spider-lmop.md) is joined by four [giant spiders](/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) that defend their master to the death. If they are expecting trouble, the spiders hide behind pillars, and Nezznar casts [invisibility](/compendium/spells/invisibility.md) on himself and stands near the table. Make a Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check for the spiders. When intruders appear, the spiders try to entangle them in webs before closing to melee range. Nezznar joins the fray on the round after the spiders attack.

If the [doppelganger](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) from 18 retreated to this area, it assumes the guise of [Nundro Rockseeker](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nundro-rockseeker-lmop.md) so that Nezznar can use the "dwarf" as leverage to force the party's surrender (although the drow won't actually harm the doppelganger). See the "Roleplaying Nezznar" section for more information on the drow villain.

### Statue

The statue depicts Dumathoin, the dwarven god of mining. Any character who has proficiency in [Religion](/rules/skills.md#Religion) recognizes the deity. The statue is beautifully carved, and its emerald eyes appear extremely valuable. However, the jewels are clever fakes made of worthless glass, as close inspection and a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals. Nevertheless, a powerful spell protects them, and a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals a strong aura of abjuration magic surrounding the statue.

A character can climb the statue easily and pry a jewel loose with a successful DC 10 Strength check. However, if either eye is removed, the pillars that line the walls crack, triggering a ceiling collapse. Each creature in the room must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 bludgeoning damage from falling rubble and falling [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) on a failure, or taking only half the damage on a success.

### Table

The table is strewn with notes and maps showing Nezznar's efforts at exploring the mine so far. A black leather sack of treasure is amid the papers (see the "Treasure" section).

### Roleplaying Nezznar

Even though he intends to kill the characters, Nezznar is curious about them. Given the chance, he quizzes the characters at length regarding their identities, allegiances, interests, and goals. He files it all away in memory in the hope that someday he might find a use for what he learns.

Nezznar admits to being the Black Spider, and to using the Cragmaw goblins and the Redbrands to ensure that Wave Echo Cave remains his secret. He will say or do anything to put the characters off their guard, including promising to surrender or proposing cooperation against the monsters impeding his progress toward reaching the Forge of Spells. However, he betrays the characters as soon as they outlive their usefulness.

### Developments

The creatures in 18 can hear sounds of combat in this room. If they haven't already been dealt with, they arrive after 3 rounds and act immediately after Nezznar's giant spiders in the initiative count.

If the characters capture Nezznar and deliver him to the townmaster's hall in Phandalin, the drow is locked up until [Sildar Hallwinter](/compendium/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-lmop.md) or another representative of the Lords' Alliance can escort him to Neverwinter to face justice and interrogation. However, unless the characters post guards outside Nezznar's cell, Halia Thornton (see page 17) breaks him out of jail, smuggles him out of Phandalin, and delivers him into the waiting arms of the Zhentarim. The Zhents want to learn everything the Black Spider knows about Wave Echo Cave. What happens to Nezznar at that point is up to you.

### Treasure

Nezznar carries a [potion of healing](/compendium/items/potion-of-healing.md) and a [spider staff](/compendium/items/spider-staff-lmop.md). In addition, the drow carries an iron key with a head shaped like an anvil. This key unlocks the door to 20.

Nezznar's exploration of Wave Echo Cave has yielded some treasure, which the drow keeps in the sack on the wooden table. The sack contains 190 ep, 130 gp, 15 pp, nine small gemstones (10 gp each), and a dwarven ale mug made of hammered electrum (100 gp).

### Awarding Experience Points

If Nezznar is captured alive and delivered to [Sildar Hallwinter](/compendium/bestiary/npc/sildar-hallwinter-lmop.md) or Townmaster Wester in Phandalin, award the party double his XP value.

## 20. Priests' Quarters

The door to this room is locked, requiring [thieves' tools](/compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check to open. Nezznar (19) carries the key.

Unless the characters are being stealthy, any activity at the door attracts the attention of Nezznar and his allies in 19, prompting the drow to send his giant spiders to investigate.

This room formerly belonged to the priest in charge of Dumathoin's temple (19), but Nezznar has appropriated it for use as a cell. The figure lying on the floor is [Nundro](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nundro-rockseeker-lmop.md), a dwarf [commoner](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) and the youngest of the three Rockseeker brothers. Nezznar spared him because he thought the dwarf might know more about the mine than he admitted. The drow has interrogated Nundro harshly once or twice a day ever since capturing him.

### Developments

Nundro is grateful if the adventurers rescue him, and he offers to tag along for the duration of their stay in Wave Echo Cave. Nundro doesn't know any more about the layout than the characters, so he hasn't much to offer in the way of useful information. See the "NPC Party Members" sidebar (page 11) for tips on running Nundro.

If the characters deal with Nezznar and his minions, this area serves as a safe and comfortable place to rest before continuing their explorations of the mine.

### Awarding Experience Points

If Nundro is rescued and survives the adventure, divide 200 XP equally among the characters in the party.

## Conclusion

With hard work and a little luck, the adventurers have defeated the Black Spider and undone his destructive plots, cleared Phandalin of the ruffians who threatened its people, and reclaimed the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave. Their deeds will be long remembered in this corner of the Sword Coast. In years to come, the restored mines of the Phandelver's Pact will bring great riches to Phandalin and help establish peace and prosperity in the area.

Gundren and [Nundro Rockseeker](/compendium/bestiary/npc/nundro-rockseeker-lmop.md) take over administration of the new mine. For the adventurers' service to their family, they gladly award the party a 10 percent share of the mine's profits. If the characters want to remain in Phandalin and perhaps restore Tresendar Manor or establish homes of their own, the people of the area are glad to have them stay. Even if they choose to move on in search of new adventures, they'll always have a warm welcome in Phandalin.

By the end of the adventure, the characters should be 5th level. If your players wish to continue playing their characters, you can use the contents of this set to create your own adventures; the mysterious map found in 14 of Wave Echo Cave provides one possible adventure hook, but feel free to explore other ideas using the monsters, magic items, and locations in this adventure. If you want to create adventures for characters higher than 5th level, you'll need the basic rules online or the advanced rulebooks: the _Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide_ and _Monster Manual_.
