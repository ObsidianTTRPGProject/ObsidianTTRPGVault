# Masterpiece Imbroglio

*An Adventure for 5th-Level Characters*

A group of scholars and sages known as the Cognoscenti Esoterica recently purchased a painting of Constantori, a famous courtier rumored to once have been the most beautiful man alive. The portrait supposedly has occult properties, but before the sages could study it, the painting was stolen by the Agile Hand, a thieves' guild. In this adventure, the characters must retrieve the portrait of Constantori from the Agile Hand's guildhouse and return it to Adrisa Carimorte, a member of the Cognoscenti Esoterica.

## Adventure Background

![](img/adventure/KftGV/044-06-002.ch6-key.webp)

The Cognoscenti Esoterica collects obscure objects of curious origin and historical significance. The group's interests focus on items owned by powerful and popular individuals speculated to maintain covert ties with occult or nefarious organizations. Serious academics often write off the Cognoscenti Esoterica as charlatans or pranksters, and with good reason: the Cognoscenti rarely collect enough evidence to support their outlandish claims. Still, the organization occasionally stumbles upon something of true significance.

Recently the group acquired a magical painting known as *Constantori's Portrait*, a work reputed to depict one of the most beautiful men who ever lived. The group spent a small fortune acquiring the painting and prepared to host a debate over its cultural significance, the aesthetics of masculine beauty, and its influence on society. They also planned to research the portrait's magical properties (see the end of this adventure for a description of the painting's properties).

The day after the debate was announced, a small team of Agile Hand thieves raided the Cognoscenti's vaults. The thieves slew three guards during the theft, then fled with the painting. Word has spread that the Agile Hand plans to fence the portrait in the next three days.

During the robbery, Cognoscenti guards captured a lookout working with the thieves. This captive is willing to trade information for his freedom.

The Cognoscenti Esoterica distrusts the authorities and doesn't wish to report the theft. Instead, the organization seeks skilled adventurers to recover the painting.

## Adventure Hooks

If you're not using the Golden Vault as a patron (see "Using the Golden Vault" below), you can use any of the following hooks to help motivate the characters:

- **A Favor Owed** The characters either owe someone in the Cognoscenti Esoterica a favor or seek the counsel of one of its members. Upon arrival, this individual might request that the characters retrieve *Constantori's Portrait* to repay the individual's patronage or for mutual benefit.
- **Knowledge Sought** The characters have prior reason to find the portrait or seek knowledge they believe someone in the Cognoscenti Esoterica possesses. However, the knowledge actually resides in *Constantori's Portrait*.
- **Strike a Blow** One or more characters have clashed with the Agile Hand in the past and want to strike a blow against the troublesome thieves' guild.

## Using the Golden Vault

If you're using the Golden Vault as a patron, a golden key is delivered to the characters in whatever manner you deem fit. When the characters use this key to open their music box, the lid pops open and a soothing voice says the following:

>>"Greetings, operatives. A valuable painting has been stolen from a member of the Cognoscenti Esoterica, an organization with connections to the Golden Vault. The Cognoscenti Esoterica specializes in the study of rare objects of historical significance. We suspect that the stolen painting, Constantori's Portrait, has magical properties and ties to the occult.
>>
>>"This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you to infiltrate the guildhouse of the Agile Hand, a dangerous thieves' guild. Find where the painting is kept, recover it, and return it to Adrisa Carimorte of the Cognoscenti Esoterica. A preliminary meeting with Adrisa has already been arranged, and a coach will arrive shortly to deliver you safely to her location. Good luck, operatives."
>>

Closing the music box causes the golden key to vanish.

A coach pulled by two black horses arrives not long after the key vanishes. The coach driver, a cheerful woman, invites the characters to climb aboard and delivers them safely to Adrisa if they accept the ride.

## Barn Visit

Read or paraphrase the following if the characters choose to meet with Adrisa Carimorte:

>>Rain begins to fall as your coach pulls up beside an open barn surrounded by fields of dead corn. A tall, well-dressed human woman emerges from the barn as you exit the coach. "Thank you for coming," she says with a smile. "I'm Adrisa Carimorte. My organization would like to hire you to retrieve a painting that was stolen from us by a thieves' guild. For the painting's safe return, I'm prepared to pay you two thousand gold pieces. Let's go inside to escape the rain, shall we? There's someone else I'd like you to meet."
>>

Adrisa Carimorte (neutral, human **mage**) is an influential member of the Cognoscenti Esoterica. If the characters turn down the offer, Adrisa has the coach driver return them whence they came. If the characters express interest in the job, Adrisa escorts them into the barn, which the Cognoscenti Esoterica sometimes uses as a warehouse and secret meeting place. The barn has magical wards that thwart all attempts to magically scry on its interior, as well as other wards Adrisa temporarily deactivated.

Adrisa leads the characters up a ladder to the barn's loft. Once everyone is in the loft, read or paraphrase the following:

>>In the middle of the loft, tied to a wooden chair, is a scrawny human man with patchy facial hair. He is sweating profusely and chewing nervously on a cloth gag.
>>

The man tied to the chair is Grinky Brithwort (neutral evil, human **bandit**). He was captured during the theft of *Constantori's Portrait* and has useful information about the Agile Hand and its headquarters—information the characters can use to help plan their heist.

### Grinky's Deal

Grinky has been associated with the Agile Hand for years. During the theft of *Constantori's Portrait*, Grinky's job was to watch for guards. He was caught and given to Adrisa for questioning. Adrisa has offered to release Grinky in exchange for his help.

### What Grinky Knows

Adrisa gives the characters a chance to question Grinky. During this conversation, Grinky shares the following true information:

- **Guildmaster Dusk** "Guildmaster Dusk leads the Agile Hand. She's a trained assassin with powerful political connections."
- **Getting Inside** "The windows of the guildhouse are boarded up, and its doors are usually locked. At least three guild members have master keys to the doors: Guildmaster Dusk; Elix the Saint, one of Dusk's lieutenants; and Jaymont the Sinner, the guild's resident spy. The master of ravens, Gwish, might have a key as well. If you want to get your hands on a master key, your best bet is to snatch it from Elix the Saint, who frequents a seedy tavern called the Tipsy Tankard."
- **Guildhouse Guards** "By late evening, most guild members have gone to sleep. Senior guild members bully lower-ranking guild members into taking the late-night shifts."
- **Guild Membership** "Dusk isn't accepting new guild members right now. I've been working for the guild since I was a kid, and I'm still not a ranking member."
- **Portrait's Location** "I don't know where the portrait is, but I'm guessing it's either in Guildmaster Dusk's quarters, which are on the second floor of the guildhouse's tower, or hidden in the basement, where new guild members are trained."
- **Supply Deliveries** "Supplies are sometimes delivered to the guildhouse by riders on horseback or by mule-drawn cart. All supplies are received and inspected by Laris Drot, the stablemaster, at the livery stables."

### What Adrisa Knows

After the characters question Grinky, they can ask Adrisa questions about the Agile Hand or *Constantori's Portrait*. She knows the following:

- **Guildmaster Dusk** "Everyone seems to ignore the activities of Dusk and her guild. Larceny is the Agile Hand's specialty, but Dusk uses blackmail, extortion, threats of violence, and whatever else it takes to keep her enemies at bay."
- **Portrait Lore** "The portrait is the work of famed artist Dkesii Kwan and was commissioned by the late Daiyani Grysthorn, a grand dame in the criminal underworld. The painting is sentient and was made to eavesdrop on conversations and pass along secrets to its owner. Like its beautiful subject, the painting is notoriously vain."
- **Sense of Urgency** "It's likely that the Agile Hand has a buyer for the painting. Therefore, it's vital you recover it as quickly as possible before it ends up in an even more secure location."

## Planning the Heist

The characters' goals are simple: locate the portrait and return it safely to the Cognoscenti Esoterica.

### Grinky's Map

Grinky furnished Adrisa with a sketched map of the Agile Hand's guildhouse (see *map 6.1*). Adrisa gives Grinky's map to the characters.

Grinky is neither well informed nor a high-ranking member of the Agile Hand. Consequently, his map contains inaccuracies, such as the following:

- Grinky's guesses as to where Dusk stored the painting are wrong.
- Grinky's map is missing the topmost level of the tower, where the painting is kept (area G27 on *map 6.2*).

### Elix the Saint

Characters can obtain one of the guildhouse's master keys from Elix the Saint (lawful evil, human **bandit captain**), a high-ranking member of the Agile Hand and one of Guildmaster Dusk's more capable lieutenants. After questioning Grinky, the characters should know that Elix the Saint frequents a tavern called the Tipsy Tankard, which is about a 45-minute walk from the guildhouse. He travels there alone because he likes to flirt with a bartender named Karyssa (neutral, human **commoner**).

Elix usually leaves the guildhouse at sundown and returns by midnight. Characters can approach him during this interval and take his master key by force or snatch it from him without his knowledge. As an action, a character within reach of Elix can try to snatch the key from his pocket, doing so with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If the attempt is made in a crowded place where others might notice the theft, increase the DC by 5.

Elix would sooner die than betray Guildmaster Dusk, although a *suggestion* spell or other coercive magic can wring information from him. For example, he knows where *Constantori's Portrait* is being kept (on the tower's third floor, above Guildmaster Dusk's private quarters).

Clever characters can steal Elix's identity as well as his key. If Elix is either detained or disposed of, a character can use magic (for example, *alter self* or *disguise self*) to mimic his appearance. A disguise kit can also help perpetrate such a ruse. In this form, a character can search most of the guildhouse without inviting altercations.

If Elix the Saint doesn't return to the guildhouse by midnight, the lookouts on watch assume he had too much to drink and either passed out in a field or got thrown in jail for brawling. His failure to return won't cause alarm.

### Magical Surveillance

Characters can use *invisibility* spells to approach and observe the guildhouse without being seen. They can also use a *locate object* spell to pinpoint the painting's location (area G27 on *map 6.2*). If they don't have access to such magic, they can request Adrisa's help. Within a day, she can obtain a *spell scroll* of *locate object* for them.

The characters might have access to other magic that can help with surveillance, such as the *clairvoyance* spell. A wizard's familiar can slip inside the guildhouse without attracting too much attention, as can a druid using Wild Shape to assume the form of a stray cat or some other common animal.

![Map 6.1: Players' Map](img/adventure/KftGV/045-06-003.player-map.webp)

## Agile Hand Guildhouse

The Agile Hand's guildhouse is situated at the end of a winding, cobbled street that runs parallel to a small river. The back of the stables faces a grassy embankment scattered with mulberry trees.

The guildhouse is a wooden complex consisting of a main building with an adjoining tower and basement, as well as a livery area that includes stables, an office, and quarters for paying visitors.

### General Features

Recurring features of the guildhouse are described in the following sections.

#### Doors

Doors in the guildhouse complex are locked unless otherwise noted. Some individuals have keys to specific areas, as noted in their descriptions. Others possess a master key that opens all locked doors in the complex.

As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to open a locked door, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or force open the door with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. Each door has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

***Secret Doors.*** A secret door blends in perfectly with the wall that surrounds it. A character who uses an action to examine a stretch of wall can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, finding any secret door hidden there on a success. The guildhouse complex's secret doors have well-oiled hinges, allowing them to be opened and closed quietly.

#### Floors

The upper floors, stable loft, and porches are unlacquered hardwood planks. Rough, splintery, and slightly warped with age, these floors creak when walked on. Characters make any ability checks to move stealthily on the upper floors at disadvantage. The ground floor is paved with slate tiles, except the stable, which is hard-packed dirt. The basement is cobblestone.

#### Light

The stables are unlit. During the day, light filters in from the entrances and through cracks in the plank walls, filling the area with dim light.

The rest of the guildhouse complex is filled with bright light during the day, either from lanterns or the sun. At night, rooms and hallways are dimly lit by low-burning lanterns.

Guild members carry light sources with them when they descend into the basement, which is unlit.

#### Walls

The exterior walls are made of wood. The interior walls are plastered lath, making them relatively soundproof. The basement walls are made of clay bricks braced at regular intervals by thick, rough-cut wooden beams.

#### Windows

Most of the guildhouse complex's windows are boarded up (except the ones in area G21), but tiny cracks between the boards allow creatures to peer through. Prying away the boards is relatively easy, but doing so quietly requires a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check.

### Guild Member Names

If you need a name for a low- or mid-ranked member of the Agile Hand, pick one from the following list:

>>Brick Face
>>
>>Deadly Nell
>>
>>Evil Marvus
>>
>>Farrow the Filcher
>>
>>Greedy Pete
>>
>>Grimbeard
>>
>>Night Lily
>>
>>Ookie the Cheat
>>
>>Pistachio
>>
>>Stickyfingers
>>
>>Vaelin Shadowblade
>>
>>Zeke the Sneak
>>

### High Alert

If a situation arises that puts the guildhouse on high alert, a task force assembles to deal with the threat. This force is summarized in the Guild Task Force table. Subtract any individuals who have already been neutralized.

##### Guild Task Force
| Creature                              | Location                        |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Guildmaster Dusk (**assassin**)       | G26                             |
| Gwish (**oni**)                       | G21                             |
| Jaymont the Sinner (**doppelganger**) | G3                              |
| Elix the Saint (**bandit captain**)   | G23                             |
| 3 **bandits**                         | One each from G19, G22, and G24 |
| 3 **thugs**                           | One from G13 and two from G25   |

### Guildhouse Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.2.

![Map 6.2: DM's map](img/adventure/KftGV/046-map-6.02-dms-map.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/KftGV/047-map-6.02-dms-map-player.webp)
#### G1: Front Porch

>>Nailed to this lengthy porch are short planks that bear the words "Private Property. No Trespassing!" in Common. A lookout is stationed on a second-floor balcony above the western end of the porch.
>>

Any character who approaches the porch in plain view is spotted by the **bandit** on the south balcony (area G22), who calls out, "Hey, you, get lost! Can't you read the signs?" If this warning is ignored, the lookout shouts the same thing again, putting the guildhouse on high alert, then shoots a crossbow bolt into the ground near the character's feet as a final warning.

***Drop Box.*** The staircase in front of the double door to area G10 has a loose plank near the top. This plank conceals a drop box where visitors stash black-market goods, fenced items, and guild tributes. Any character who lifts the plank sees a dusty satchel in the drop box. The satchel contains 25 sp and a piece of parchment that transfers ownership of two horses to Guildmaster Dusk.

#### G2a: Livery Stables

>>Ten horse stables and a hayloft line the walls of this barn, which has an open doorway at each end. Flies swarm around a full dung cart that exudes a horrible stench.
>>

The stalls contain ten **riding horses**.

***Cart.*** The dung-filled cart is a fire hazard. If the cart is pushed against a wall and set ablaze, the fire quickly spreads to the loft and ignites the hay there. After 1 minute, the smoke and panic of the horses put the guildhouse on high alert.

***Fire.*** The Agile Hand isn't equipped to stop a fire that starts in the barn. Such a fire takes 1 minute to spread throughout the structure. After that, the fire moves 5 feet westward each minute until the whole east building is engulfed. After 5 minutes, the building collapses, and the stairs to the basement are buried in flaming debris. The west building is spared.

***Ladders.*** A wooden ladder in each corner stall ascends to a trapdoor that leads to the hayloft (area G2b). The trapdoors are unlocked.

#### G2b: Hayloft

The hayloft is 10 feet above the stables and consists of a 5-foot-wide wooden walkway that runs the perimeter of the building. Broad, square loading doors open in the north and south walls, each fitted with block-and-tackle rigs for hoisting hay bales and other supplies into the loft. Hay bales and burlap sacks stuffed with feed grains take up most of the space. A few pitchforks, ropes, and feed buckets lie scattered about the bales.

***Stable Hand.*** A young stable hand named Needly Pitts (neutral, human **commoner**) lazes in the loft, supposedly guarding against horse thieves. He has nodded off but wakes if characters disturb the horses, make too much noise in the barn, or start a fire. In the event of trouble, Needly bangs a metal pail and yells for the stablemaster (see area G16), who takes 1 minute to arrive.

#### G3: Staircase

>>Halfway up this flight of stairs is a sleeping figure wrapped in a wool blanket. A door is situated at the top of the stairs.
>>

The door at the top of the stairs is unlocked and opens into area G14.

***Jaymont the Sinner.*** The figure on the steps is Jaymont the Sinner, a **doppelganger** disguised as a drunken guest. Only Guildmaster Dusk knows Jaymont's true nature. The doppelganger pretends to be asleep, but a character can discern that it's awake with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. Jaymont doesn't start fights it knows it can't win and allows intruders to pass by. When the intruders are gone, Jaymont taps three times on the staircase wall to alert Gwish in area G21, then slinks away to alert Guildmaster Dusk in area G26.

***Master Key.*** Jaymont carries a master key that unlocks all doors in the guildhouse complex.

#### G4: Cartwright's Workshop

>>Three carts occupy this room. Pegs and hooks on the inner walls bear ropes, tackle, leather harnesses, wheels, and leatherworking tools. Shoved into a corner is a crate filled with horseshoes. Nearby, shelves hold smaller boxes filled with buckles, nails, cotter pins, and miscellaneous hardware.
>>

The shop has two access points: the stables to the east and a door to the west that leads to area G7.

***Treasure.*** Characters can assemble one set of *leatherworker's tools* from the tools stored here.

#### G5: Livery Office

>>A wooden countertop divides the room. Signboards display services and fees for stabling and room rentals. Two keys hang from hooks on the east wall above the counter. A third hook is bare.
>>

When the office is staffed, a visitor can secure an upstairs bed for 5 cp per night (5 sp for a private room). Accommodations can also be made in the stables for a traveler's mount at a cost of 1 sp per night.

***Coin Box.*** Tucked behind the counter is a wooden coin box with a copper clasp. A character who inspects the coin box before opening it notices a row of tiny pinholes in the lid. The coin box contains 15 cp and 11 sp, as well as a **spider**.

***Keys.*** The two keys hanging on the wall unlock the doors to areas G17 and G18, respectively.

***Secret Door.*** A secret door in the office's back wall leads to area G6.

#### G6: Basement Staircase

>>A wooden staircase in the northeast corner of this empty, boarded-up room leads to the basement.
>>

The stairs descend 15 feet to area G28.

#### G7: Service Entrance

>>Hanging on the walls of this small, muddy room are several riding cloaks, bits and harnesses, oil lanterns, and coils of rope.
>>

Guild members store their riding gear here. A search of the room yields nothing of great value.

#### G8: Courtyard

>>A cobblestone courtyard is wedged between the two main buildings of the guildhouse. Situated in the middle of the yard is a stone well rigged with a simple bucket winch.
>>

The well is 30 feet deep and has fresh water filling its bottom 5 feet. The well's winch and rope are sturdy enough to bear 250 pounds of weight.

#### G9: Conference Room

>>This room contains several unmatched chairs situated around a long oak table scarred with knife marks. On the table sits a half-eaten cheese wheel, four clay wine jugs, and some wine-stained flagons.
>>

Guildmaster Dusk holds meetings here.

#### G10: Main Hall

Visitors who try to enter this hall through the north door must contend with a trap.

***Back-Door Trap.*** The northernmost door has a "No Trespassers!" sign hanging on the outside of it and is nailed shut on the inside (a fact not discernible from the outside). As an action, a character can try to force open the door using brute strength, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. Breaking down the door puts the guildhouse on high alert unless a *silence* spell or similar magic is used to muffle the noise.

A character who searches the door for traps can make a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the check is successful, the character notices that the doorknob is loose and attached to a vial of poison gas hidden in the door itself. As an action, a character can try to disable the trap using thieves' tools, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

Unless the trap is disabled, tugging or turning the knob causes the vial in the door to break, releasing a cloud of poisonous gas that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the door. The trap also triggers if the door is forced open. Each creature in the trap's area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 16 (3d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. The trap can be triggered only once.

***Entering the Hall.*** Use the following boxed text to describe the hallway:

>>A long, well-trafficked hall runs the width of the house. A staircase along the west wall leads to the second floor.
>>

The stairs climb 15 feet to area G23.

#### G11: Kitchen

>>A cooking hearth occupies one corner of this kitchen, and nets holding dried sausages, cheese, peppers, and garlic hang from the rafters. Other items found here include a butcher's block, a table for preparing meals, a pail of potatoes, a few cast-iron pots, a sack of flour, a tin filled with cooking utensils, a block of salt, and a knife with a cutting board.
>>

The kitchen contains nothing of great value.

#### G12: Parlor

>>This room contains a fireplace, a tattered couch, and several upholstered chairs, one of which is bright blue. Playing cards and coins lie scattered across a table. Slumped around the table are four drunken guild members clutching empty mugs and reeking of ale.
>>

The four guild members have been drinking and playing card games. The motley crew consists of three **thugs** and one **gladiator**. The thugs are poisoned and unconscious, while the gladiator is merely poisoned and spoiling for a fight. The unconscious condition ends on a thug who is wounded, knocked out of their chair, or splashed with a pint or more of liquid.

***Blue Chair.*** The blue chair in the south corner covers a secret trapdoor in the stone floor. A character who examines the floor near the chair can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, finding the trapdoor on a success. Pulling open the trapdoor reveals a wooden ladder that descends 15 feet to area G37.

***Treasure.*** The coins on the table amount to 65 cp, 35 sp, and 11 gp.

#### G13: Tower Rotunda

>>A lit fireplace warms this mostly empty tower chamber. A wooden staircase hugs the west wall.
>>

A **thug** sits near the bottom of the stairs, engrossed in a saucy novella. If this guard detects intruders, he tries to run up the stairs to wake Guildmaster Dusk in area G26.

#### G14: Upstairs Foyer

>>This rectangular room has a door on every wall. A plaque on the west door says, "Private Rooms."
>>

The north door leading to area G19 is locked; the other doors are unlocked.

#### G15: L-Shaped Hall

>>Wooden doors line the walls of this L-shaped hallway.
>>

***Closets.*** The two small rooms to the north are closets behind unlocked doors. One stores a mop and broom, a few buckets, and a stack of copper chamber pots. The other has shelves holding linens, blankets, soap, and candles.

#### G16: Stablemaster's Quarters

This room belongs to the stablemaster, Laris Drot (neutral, human **commoner**), who is a stout woman in her fifties. Laris carries two keys on her person: one unlocks the door to this room, and the other unlocks the doors to area G7.

A wooden trunk at the foot of Laris's bed contains folded clothing and personal effects.

***Treasure.*** On a nightstand, next to a set of keys to the stables, is a coin pouch containing 5 gp, 13 sp, and 25 cp.

***Development.*** If Laris is here when the stable hand in area G2b bangs his pail, Laris heads to the stables to find out what's going on. It takes her 1 minute to get there.

#### G17: Small Common Room

This room stinks of horse manure due to its proximity to the stables. It contains two neatly made beds, two empty footlockers, and a nightstand with an oil-filled lantern hanging above it. Beneath each bed is a copper chamber pot.

#### G18: Large Common Room

This room stinks of horse manure due to its proximity to the stables. It contains four neatly made beds, each with its own nightstand and empty footlocker. An oil-filled lantern rests atop each nightstand. Beneath each bed is a copper chamber pot.

***Treasure.*** One of the lanterns is a *lantern of revealing*. No one in the guild is aware the lantern is magical.

#### G19. North Balcony

>>A wooden railing encloses this balcony. Mounted on one corner of the railing is a copper spyglass.
>>

A **bandit** stationed atop this balcony watches for trouble coming from the north and west. If she sees anything suspicious or threatening, she shouts loud enough to put the rest of the guildhouse on high alert. This bandit carries a key that unlocks the door to area G14.

***Spyglass.*** The *spyglass* attached to the balcony is missing one of its lenses and is nonfunctional.

#### G20: Private Room

>>This private room contains a bed, a nightstand, a footlocker, and a small fireplace. A small oil lamp, a pewter water pitcher, and two mugs rest on the nightstand. Sitting on the edge of the bed is a heavy man in a nightgown.
>>

A traveling merchant named Thyval Horne (neutral, human **commoner**) rents this room. On the nightstand rests a key that unlocks the door to this room. Beneath the bed is a copper chamber pot.

***Roleplaying Thyval.*** The merchant hasn't had a good night's sleep in days and quickly angers if disturbed. Characters who threaten Thyval or use magic to coerce him can pry the following information out of him:

- Guildmaster Dusk is hosting an unscrupulous, well-connected noble named Dartinal Livereth. (Thyval suspects the two are lovers.)
- Jaymont the Sinner, the guild's resident spy, is a master of disguise.
- Thyval can't sleep because of the squawking birds in the room next door (area G21).

#### G21: Gwish's Room

>>The room contains a large bed, a sturdy trunk, a wooden nightstand, and a darkened fireplace. The windows here aren't boarded, and the window in the west wall is open slightly. In the middle of the room, an old man in an oversized black robe carefully removes a strip of parchment coiled around the leg of a raven while muttering kind words to the bird. Two more ravens watch from the rafters.
>>

The man is an **oni** named Gwish. Guildmaster Dusk is the only other guild member who knows Gwish's true nature.

Gwish is reclusive and rarely interacts with the other guild members. The oni has three **ravens** that act as messengers, and it uses a *ring of animal influence* to speak with them. These ravens deliver secret messages to the guildmaster's spies abroad and receive similar messages from those spies.

If one or more characters interrupt the oni, it politely asks them to leave. If they refuse, it shoos away the ravens and attacks the characters. The oni's glaive leans in the northeast corner behind the door.

***Gwish's Trunk.*** When the oni is hungry, it sneaks from the guildhouse and invisibly preys on the city, feeding primarily on anyone sleeping outside. The trunk at the foot of Gwish's bed is filled with gnawed bones mixed with small bundles of torn clothing.

***Master Key.*** One of the deep pockets on Gwish's robe contains a master key that unlocks all doors in the guildhouse.

***Raven's Note.*** Gwish has received a note from one of Guildmaster Dusk's spies. The note is written in code on a slip of parchment, and only Guildmaster Dusk is authorized to read it. Gwish plans to deliver the message to Dusk once her guest leaves (see area G26).

A *comprehend languages* spell can decipher the note, as can a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check after studying the note for 1 minute. It reads, "Constantori in danger. Cognoscenti retaliation imminent. Be on high alert."

#### G22: South Balcony

>>A wooden railing encloses this balcony. Mounted on one corner of the railing is a copper spyglass.
>>

A **bandit** stationed atop this balcony watches for trouble coming from the south and east. If she sees anything suspicious or threatening, she shouts loud enough to put the rest of the guildhouse on high alert. This bandit carries keys that unlock the doors to areas G23, G24, and G25.

***Spyglass.*** The *spyglass*, which is damaged but functional, is worth 250 gp.

#### G23: Stolen Goods

>>Deep scrapes crisscross the floor of this spacious room, and wood shavings scatter the perimeter. A string of oil lanterns dangles from the ceiling, suspended on block and tackle above several containers—mostly small casks and crates, although there's an earth-encrusted coffin here as well.
>>

Elix the Saint (lawful evil, human **bandit captain**; see the "Elix the Saint" section earlier in the adventure) works here during the day. Armed with a crowbar, he examines containers stolen by the Agile Hand. He then records their contents (and the estimated value of those contents) in a leather-bound ledger.

***Master Key.*** Elix carries a master key that unlocks all doors in the guildhouse complex.

***Treasure.*** The following stolen goods are stored here:

- Six casks of exquisite elven wine (250 gp each)
- Wooden chest containing six *poisoner's kits*
- Wooden crate containing eight sets of *thieves' tools*
- Wooden crate containing two *spyglasses* (1,000 gp each) packed in beds of straw
- Dirty wooden coffin containing the moldy corpse of a human priest wearing a copper *holy symbol* shaped like the sun (25 gp), a sun-shaped death mask made of gold (250 gp), and a *necklace of prayer beads*

#### G24: Elix's Office

>>This office contains a plain wooden desk, a simple chair, and a fireplace. A door in the south corner sports a plaque that says, "Private! Enter at your own risk."
>>

A **bandit** stands guard outside the door to Guildmaster Dusk's quarters (area G26). The bandit's job is to shout at the first sign of trouble, thus alerting the guildmaster.

***Desk.*** If the characters search the desk at night, they find a leather-bound ledger in an unlocked drawer, along with a writing quill and a jar of ink. The ledger provides an account of stolen goods acquired by the Agile Hand, but *Constantori's Portrait* is not among the items listed.

#### G25: Shared Bedroom

Guild members take turns resting here. The room contains two beds, two nightstands, and two trunks (each one packed with linens). Tucked beneath each bed is a copper chamber pot. A hearth in the south corner keeps the room warm.

***Sleeping Guards.*** Two **thugs** sleep in the beds. They wake if disturbed and spend their first action scrambling for their weapons.

#### G26: Dusk's Quarters

>>This circular room contains a canopied bed with a leather trunk at the foot of it and a fireplace. Wooden staircases hug the walls—one leading up, the other down. The scent of tobacco hangs in the air.
>>

![Among the clutter on the guildmaster's desk is a diary that might contain a secret or two](img/adventure/KftGV/049-06-005.desk-clutter.webp)

Unless she has been lured elsewhere, Guildmaster Dusk (lawful evil, half-elf **assassin**) is asleep in bed with her lover, a politically influential noble named Dartinal Livereth (lawful evil, human **noble**). Neither is wearing armor, but they keep their weapons within reach.

If the guildhouse is on high alert, Dusk leaves the room to find out what's happening. Meanwhile, Dartinal smokes a pipe in bed and waits for Dusk to return.

***Fireplace.*** Resting on the fireplace mantel are a wedge of soap, a brush, a clay pipe, and an ivory tobacco jar carved in the shape of a skull. Buried in the ashes of the hearth is a spare *shortsword* covered with soot.

***Leather Trunk.*** This trunk holds a spare, loaded *light crossbow* under some linens, bedding, and neatly folded outfits.

***Master Key.*** Guildmaster Dusk keeps a master key on a nightstand next to her bed, and she takes it with her when she leaves the room. The key unlocks all doors in the guildhouse complex.

#### G27: Tower Peak

This room is situated at the top of the tower and is off limits to everyone except Guildmaster Dusk, who comes here to reflect, doodle in her diary, and gaze upon her latest acquisition: *Constantori's Portrait*.

>>This tower chamber is lit by a pewter chandelier suspended from beams that support a conical roof. A cluttered writing desk and a padded chair are positioned opposite the descending staircase. A gold-framed painting of a beautiful, well-dressed man hangs in a shallow alcove near the top of the stairs.
>>

Characters who search the guildmaster's cluttered desk find sketches and descriptions of deadly mechanical traps, including a rough sketch of the trap in this room (see "Trap" below).

***Constantori's Portrait.*** The painting that hangs in the alcove is *Constantori's Portrait* (described at the end of the adventure). Guildmaster Dusk is attuned to the painting and has commanded it to defend itself against all creatures except her. As an action, a character can throw a sheet over the painting, making it unable to cast spells.

The Cognoscenti Esoterica was wrong about one thing: Guildmaster Dusk has no intention of selling the painting. By learning its secrets, she hopes to become as notorious and wealthy as the late Daiyani Grysthorn, the crime lord who commissioned the painting in the first place.

***Trap.*** Canisters of poisonous gas are hidden in the wall behind the painting. Removing the painting from its hooks without first disabling the trap causes the gas to spew from tiny holes previously concealed by the painting. Each creature in the room when the gas is released must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A character who searches the alcove for traps spots the holes behind the painting with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. This check is made with advantage if the character saw the trap's sketch in Dusk's diary. Once the trap is detected, a character can spend 1 minute trying to disable it, either by plugging the holes or by placing counterweights on the hooks as someone else carefully lifts the painting. The character trying to disable the trap must make a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, disabling the trap on a success and triggering the trap on a failure.

#### G28: Cellar

This room lies at the bottom of a wooden staircase that climbs 15 feet to area G6. The cellar is unlit.

>>This dank cellar reeks of soured wine. Wooden trunks line the south wall, and a chamber to the east contains stacks of barrels and crates.
>>

The crates, barrels, and trunks are all empty.

***Secret Door.*** A secret door in the south wall can't be opened from this side without magic (see area G33 for details). It leads to area G33.

***Thieves' Test.*** The door leading to area G29 is unlocked and has the following note (handwritten in Common) tacked to it:

>>Here are the rules. Look for keys and keyholes. Watch out for my pets. Follow the arrows, but don't let them hit you. Trust your ears, and remember: a little pressure can be a good thing. Get out alive. Remember, you wanted this. Good luck, grunt.—Dusk
>>

Areas G29–G33 contain challenges that are meant to test thieves who want to join the guild. The note is meant for those applicants, but characters would be wise to heed its advice:

- "Look for keys and keyholes" and "Watch out for my pets" refer to challenges in area G29.
- "Follow the arrows, but don't let them hit you" refers to the set-up in area G31.
- "Trust your ears" and "A little pressure can be a good thing" speak to areas G32 and G33.

#### G29: Murky Pool

>>A ten-foot-square pool of murky water occupies most of this unlit room. A narrow ledge surrounds the pool, and a chalk-drawn arrow on the east wall points down.
>>

The pool is 10 feet deep, and the murky water reduces underwater visibility to 0 feet. Characters can find the way to area G30 by exploring the pool:

- **Pool Floor** A nonmagical silver key rests on the floor of the pool. A character submerged in the pool can take an action to feel around its floor, finding the key with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
- **Pool Walls** The east wall of the pool has a tiny keyhole in the middle of it. A character submerged in the pool can take an action to search the pool's walls, finding the keyhole with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
- **Secret Exit** If the pool's silver key is inserted into the pool's keyhole, a section of the pool's east wall retracts, revealing a 4-foot-high, 4-foot-wide, flooded tunnel containing a **swarm of quippers**. The swarm attacks the nearest prey. A character who swims to the far end of the tunnel and feels around for an exit finds an unlocked trapdoor in the ceiling that pops open to reveal a dry, T-shaped chamber (area G30) and a passageway leading south (area G31).
- **Light Sources** Characters who don't have darkvision must find a way to keep their light sources dry, or else they could end up fumbling in the dark until their light sources dry out.

#### G30: Trapdoor

This unlit, T-shaped area is empty except for a wooden trapdoor in the floor. A tunnel (area G31) leads south from here.

***Trapdoor.*** Below the trapdoor is a 4-foot-wide, 4-foot-high tunnel filled with murky water and a hungry **swarm of quippers** (see area G29 for details). Characters who follow this tunnel west come to a dead end unless they previously opened that end of tunnel in area G29.

#### G31: Follow the Arrows

Characters who have darkvision or a light source can see the following:

>>Chalk arrows drawn on the floor point toward the south end of this narrow corridor. Arrow slits are evenly spaced along the walls.
>>

The arrow slits are too narrow for a Small or larger character to squeeze or crawl through. Behind the arrow slits are two closed-off chambers—one to the west and one to the east. A character who has darkvision or a light source can peer through nearby arrow slits to see what each closed-off area contains: five freestanding human skeletons draped in cobwebs and clutching shortbows. Most of these skeletons are inanimate, propped-up dummies made to look threatening. Each one is a Medium object with AC 15, 4 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

Only two **skeletons** are animated, and they guard the hallway's midpoint. When a character enters the square marked T on *map 6.2*, one animated skeleton uses its reaction (if available) to make a Shortbow attack, targeting that character. The character can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to tumble out of the way; if the check is successful, the skeleton has disadvantage on its attack roll.

If a character somehow gains access to one of the closed-off chambers, perhaps by shrinking to Tiny size or by assuming a gaseous form, the animated skeleton in that area stops guarding the hallway and instead attacks that character.

***Secret Door.*** A secret door at the south end of the hallway is unlocked and can be pushed open to reveal a tunnel leading to area G32.

#### G32: Eastern Maze

Characters who have darkvision or a light source can see the following:

>>Branches in the tunnel ahead suggest you're entering some sort of maze. You hear the sounds of heavy breathing coming from somewhere ahead.
>>

Permanent *minor illusion* spells create the sounds of heavy breathing. These sounds originate in the two spaces marked T on *map 6.2*. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can track the sounds to their points of origin. A character who enters one of these squares steps on a pressure plate that sinks 1 inch into the floor and remains in that position for 1 minute before resetting itself. A character who searches that section of floor before stepping on it must make a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the check is successful, the character spots the pressure plate and can avoid it. If the characters depress the two pressure plates here along with the one in G33, the north secret door in area G33 swings open.

#### G33: Western Maze

This maze is like the one in area G32, right down to the heavy breathing. The square marked T on *map 6.2* contains a hidden pressure plate on the floor identical to the ones in area G32.

***Secret Doors.*** This maze contains two secret doors, one to the north and the other to the west:

- **North Secret Door** This secret door has three separate locks built into it. If all three pressure plates in the maze (the one in this area and the two in area G32) are in their sunken positions, the door unlocks and swings open on its own, revealing area G28 beyond. Otherwise, each of the door's three locks requires a separate *knock* spell or similar magic to bypass. The locks are hidden and can't be picked.
- **West Secret Door** This secret door is unlocked and pushes open to reveal area G34 beyond.

#### G34: Cell Block

Characters who have darkvision or a light source can see the following:

>>Vertical iron bars stretch from floor to ceiling, dividing this room into six cells. The two southernmost cells have wooden barrels and trunks in them, while the cell in the northern corner contains a scruffy-looking prisoner.
>>

All the cell doors are locked, and a secret door connects the cell block to area G33.

***G34a: Smugglers' Barrels.*** This cell contains four wooden barrels that have padded interiors and air tubes for breathing. The thieves use these barrels for smuggling people.

***G34b: Smugglers' Trunks.*** Three iron-bound trunks rest against the back wall of this cell. The chests have padded interiors and air tubes for breathing. Like the barrels in the adjoining cell, these trunks are used for smuggling people.

***G34c: Prison Cells.*** Each of these cells contains a wooden bench and a small drain hole in the floor.

Imprisoned in the northernmost cell is a thief named Dury Sneeth (neutral evil, human **spy**), who was caught taking a bribe from a member of the Velvet Glove, a rival thieves' guild. After he was rightly accused of spying for the Velvet Glove, Dury was locked up and interrogated. He found a dagger hidden behind one of the bricks in the wall of his cell, and he keeps it hidden on his person. He has no other weapons.

Guildmaster Dusk is satisfied that Dury is guilty of betraying the Agile Hand, but she hasn't gotten around to punishing him yet and has, in fact, told Dury that she's willing to give him a second chance if he behaves himself from now on. Dury is not convinced Dusk has his best interests at heart and pleads for release.

#### G35: Storage Room

>>Lining two walls of this room are four wooden crates and four wooden chests.
>>

The crates contain stolen weapons and ammunition: ten *scimitars*, twelve *light crossbows*, five *heavy crossbows*, and hundreds of *crossbow bolts*. The chests are filled with ordinary cutlery, candlesticks, plates, pitchers, and mugs.

***Treasure.*** One of the chests has a secret compartment, which a character searching the chest can find with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. The secret compartment contains six pieces of costume jewelry (5 gp each), a gold necklace with a black pearl pendant (750 gp), and a *necklace of fireballs*.

#### G36: Storage Room

>>This room is mostly empty except for a small wooden crate shoved in a corner next to a paper-wrapped block of butter.
>>

The crate is a **mimic** that loves the taste of salted butter. To keep the mimic on friendly terms, Guildmaster Dusk brings it a fresh block of salted butter every few days. The mimic attacks any character who tries to steal the block of butter but otherwise prefers to be left alone. The mimic can carry on conversations in Common.

***Secret Door.*** Hidden in the room's south corner is a secret door that swings open into area G37.

#### G37: Secret Tunnel

This tunnel has a secret door at one end and a 15-foot-tall ladder at the opposite end. The ladder climbs to a stone trapdoor in the ceiling that leads to area G12. A character at the top of the ladder can try to push open the trapdoor, doing so with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check; the check is made with disadvantage if the blue chair in area G12 is weighing down the trapdoor.

## Conclusion

If the characters return *Constantori's Portrait* to Adrisa Carimorte, she gives them their promised reward. If they also present Elix the Saint's leather-bound ledger (see areas G23 and G24), Adrisa offers to buy it for 500 gp.

If the characters deciphered the coded message delivered by Gwish's raven (see area G21) and share the message with Adrisa, she suspects one of Guildmaster Dusk's spies has infiltrated the Cognoscenti Esoterica. She thanks the characters for the information and gives them a pair of *sending stones* as an added reward. Identifying the spy is beyond the scope of this adventure but a good hook for a future one.

### For the Golden Vault

If the characters are working for the Golden Vault, Adrisa Carimorte arranges to give the characters a rare magic item of their choice (subject to your approval) as payment for delivering the painting to her. The item is delivered to the characters the next day.

## Magic Item

This section presents *Constantori's Portrait* as a magic item. In your campaign, the artist might have painted other magical portraits of Constantori, perhaps with slight differences to distinguish them.
