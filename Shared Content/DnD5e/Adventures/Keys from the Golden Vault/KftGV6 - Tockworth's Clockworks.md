# Tockworth's Clockworks

*An Adventure for 5th-Level Characters*

The clockwork automatons that guard the svirfneblin town of Little Lockford have attacked the very residents they were meant to keep safe, forcing a town-wide evacuation. At the heart of the matter is Security Overseer Tixie Tockworth, a tinkerer who has turned malicious.

In this adventure, the characters must enter Little Lockford, recover a security key, and use it to activate a fail-safe device that shuts off the automatons.

## Adventure Background

![](img/adventure/KftGV/037-05-002.ch5-key.webp)

The clockwork automatons that protect Little Lockford are the creations of a gnome tinkerer named Tixie Tockworth, who recently decided to become a mechanical being herself. She began with a series of procedures whereby she replaced parts of her body with machinery created in her workshop. At some point, Tockworth lost all compassion and empathy for her fellow townspeople. Her fellow tinkerers urged her to stop what she was doing, but she refused. When the militia tried to shut down her workshop, Tockworth unleashed her automatons on the citizens of Little Lockford, many of whom were killed. The survivors fled and regrouped outside the settlement in a nearby network of Underdark tunnels and caverns. The survivors then magically sealed the doors to Little Lockford to keep Tockworth's automatons from escaping.

Tockworth's painstaking transformation into a machine has occupied her for the past few weeks, during which time the other residents of Little Lockford have been searching for adventurers to help them reclaim their settlement.

Little Lockford's mayor, Braith Broadfoot, asks the adventurers to infiltrate the town and retrieve a security key last seen in Tockworth's possession. When used to activate a fail-safe device in Tockworth's workshop, the key permanently shuts down the automatons, rendering them harmless. How the characters deal with Tockworth is left up to them.

## Using the Golden Vault

If you're using the Golden Vault as a patron, a golden key is delivered to the characters in whatever manner you deem fit. When the characters use this key to open their music box, the lid pops open and a soothing voice says the following:

>>"Greetings, operatives. We have learned the svirfneblin town of Little Lockford needs your help. Tixie Tockworth, once entrusted with the town's security, has turned the town's clockwork automatons against the populace. This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you to infiltrate Little Lockford, retrieve a security key, and use it to power down the automatons. You are also empowered to stop Tixie Tockworth from doing further harm to the town. Start by meeting with the town's mayor, Braith Broadfoot. She's waiting for you in the caves outside the gates of Little Lockford. Good luck, operatives."
>>

Closing the music box causes the golden key to vanish.

## Into the Underdark

Little Lockford is situated in the Underdark, but the tunnels leading to the settlement are well traveled and relatively easy to navigate. Stone signs illuminated by *continual flame* spells can be found at every junction, pointing the way to the settlement.

If you want to make the journey to Little Lockford more interesting, you can insert a random encounter or two as the characters make their way through dark tunnels. To determine what the characters encounter, roll on the Underdark Encounters table.

##### Underdark Encounters
| d12  | Encounter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:----:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1   | Two **grells** drop on the characters from above.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  2   | The characters hear the clicks and clacks of three **hook horrors** several minutes before these predators appear and attack.                                                                                                                          |
|  3   | A **galeb duhr** reveals itself and tries to converse with the characters in Terran. The creature is bored and eager to strike up a conversation, if only to ask about the weather.                                                                    |
|  4   | A **black pudding** oozes from a hole in the wall and attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  5   | The characters find a Tiny clockwork device that was left behind by a svirfneblin miner. The device produces a miniature flame that can be used to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires an action.                            |
|  6   | The characters enter a small cave containing a stone throne fit for a gnome. The throne, which looks like it was carved from a stalagmite, is a **mimic** that attacks anyone who sits on it.                                                          |
| 7–12 | A **deep gnome** named Nyx Riddlestone is on the lookout for adventurers heading to Little Lockford. Nyx speaks Common, Gnomish, Terran, and Undercommon. She greets the characters curtly and offers to escort them to Mayor Broadfoot without delay. |

## Meeting the Mayor

Mayor Braith Broadfoot (neutral good, deep gnome **commoner**) speaks Common in addition to Gnomish, Terran, and Undercommon. She and her fellow gnome exiles are gathered in a cavern not too far from the front gates of the Little Lockford. If the characters say they've come to help, the mayor eagerly gives them an overview of the situation:

>>"I can't tell you how pleased we are that you're here to help us! We've sealed the gates of Little Lockford to contain the threat that has claimed so many innocent lives.
>>
>>"Some weeks ago, Tockworth, our security overseer, ordered her clockwork automatons to attack her fellow citizens. Not knowing what else to do, I ordered an evacuation. But Little Lockford is our home, and I am determined to reclaim it.
>>
>>"Tockworth built a fail-safe device to shut down the automatons in the event of malfunction. The device is in her workshop, protected by a magic symbol on the floor that messes with the mind of any creature that sets foot on it. To activate the fail-safe, you need a security key that Tockworth keeps in a safe in her workshop. We need you to retrieve the security key and use it to shut down the clockwork automatons. How you deal with Tockworth is up to you."
>>

Mayor Broadfoot provides a hand-drawn map of the town (give your players a copy of map 5.1). In her haste, the flustered mayor has flip-flopped the locations of the infirmary (area L4) and the jail (area L5) on her map.

Mayor Broadfoot also tells the characters about some useful items hidden under her desk in the town hall (area L2). The characters are free to claim the items for themselves. If asked why the items were left behind, Mayor Broadfoot admits she forgot about them in her rush to evacuate Little Lockford. The items are as follows:

- Four *potions of healing*
- A packet of *dust of disappearance*
- Two *flasks of alchemist's fire*

![Map 5.1: Players' Map](img/adventure/KftGV/038-05-003.players-map.webp)

## Planning the Heist

![Tixie Tockworth](img/adventure/KftGV/039-05-004.tixie-tockworth.webp)

Armed with Mayor Broadfoot's map, the characters can begin planning their heist. If they do so in the company of Mayor Broadfoot and her advisers, these deep gnomes share the following useful information:

- **Features** The gnomes can share the information in the "General Features" section. The "Bridges" and "Slagline" sections are especially important when it comes to planning the heist.
- **Tockworth's Automatons** If the characters request more information about Tockworth's automatons, use the information in the "Security Forces" section to describe them.
- **Tixie Tockworth** The trouble began when Tockworth began performing magical procedures on herself, replacing parts of her body with machine parts. Her fellow tinkerers urged her to stop these procedures, but she refused. The mayor ordered the militia to shut down Tockworth's workshop, but the militia was unable to get past the shield guardian stationed outside the workshop. After the militia was rebuffed, Tockworth instructed her automatons to attack everyone else in Little Lockford.
- **Warehouse Contraption** Warehouse 6, in the Cavemouth district, contains a magical drilling machine big enough to hold two characters (see area L11 for details). The svirfneblin have no clue what the characters might use it for, but it could come in handy.

### Rewards

If the characters retrieve the security key and shut down Tockworth's automatons, Mayor Broadfoot promises to award the characters the following treasure:

- Ruby ring worth 5,000 gp
- *Boots of striding and springing*
- *Driftglobe*
- *Stone of good luck*

If the characters make the case that one or more of the magic items might help them accomplish their mission, Mayor Broadfoot agrees to give them one magic item as a down payment—though if the characters abandon the mission, she expects them to return the item.

### Shown the Door

When the characters are ready to enter Little Lockford, they're led to the town's fortified entrance by Sergeant Yombad Cragknuckle (neutral good **deep gnome**), the highest ranked of the surviving militia members. Stern and scowling, he walks with a slight limp and has a heavily bandaged arm, both the result of injuries he sustained during the evacuation.

Sergeant Cragknuckle speaks Gnomish, Terran, and Undercommon, but not Common. If asked for advice on the mission, the sergeant offers the following information and guidance:

- **Friendly Advice** The sergeant urges the characters to move quickly and quietly through the town, doing their best to avoid Tockworth's automatons.
- **Avoid Cavemouth** The sergeant suggests the characters avoid the Cavemouth district due to the likely presence of monsters there. (Normally kept at bay by the clockwork automatons, monsters are likely to have ventured from their hidey-holes and into the streets. Gricks are a particular nuisance.)
- **Healing Aids** The sergeant recalls that *potions of healing* and *healer's kits* can be found in the city infirmary in Turbine Heights.

Additionally, if the characters show Sergeant Cragknuckle the map of Little Lockford provided by Mayor Broadfoot, the sergeant points out that the map flip-flops the locations of the infirmary (area L4) and the jail (area L5).

## Little Lockford Overview

Due to its strategic location and proximity to valuable resources, Little Lockford has been a consistent target of attack. As a result, the deep gnomes have fortified the town, which is described in greater detail below.

### General Features

The town is situated in a vast cavern tinged red by the magma that flows through the channels that separate the various districts. By and large, the town is well maintained, with streets and buildings composed of gray stone bricks. Other noteworthy features are summarized in the sections that follow.

#### Bridges

Bridges made of wood and metal span the magma lake at various points, connecting the town's various districts to one another. Consoles in the power station (area L6) and the security center (area L12) enable these bridges to be raised or lowered, much like a modern-day drawbridge that spans a waterway.

To control the flow of traffic through town, Tockworth has raised the following bridges: the Old Lockford–Cavemouth bridge, the Cavemouth–Smoldertown bridge, one of the two Smoldertown–Turbine Heights bridges, and the two bridges leading to the Overlook from Old Lockford and Turbine Heights.

#### Buildings

Most of Little Lockford's buildings are single-story stone structures (about 12 feet high) with stone doors that are 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. Building interiors tend to be unlit (which is of little concern to deep gnomes, who have darkvision), and they contain furnishings sized for gnomes.

Little Lockford contains many buildings not described in the adventure. If the characters investigate one of these buildings, roll on the Buildings of Little Lockford table to determine what kind of building it is. Each building's occupants took everything of value before fleeing Little Lockford, leaving nothing of value for characters to find.

##### Buildings of Little Lockford

| 77–78 | Haberdashery                                      |
| 79–82 | Jeweler's shop                                    |
| 83–84 | Scribe's workshop                                 |
| 85–88 | Smithy                                            |
| 89–92 | Tavern                                            |
| 93–96 | Tinker's workshop                                 |
| 97–00 | Wizard's domicile                                 |

#### District Elevations

While most districts sit 150 feet above the magma lake, two do not. The Overlook, built into a rock formation at the center of the cavern, sits 170 feet above the magma. Cavemouth is 120 feet above the magma.

#### Exterior Lighting

The roof and walls of Little Lockford are bathed in a fiery hue, thanks to the magma that fills the lake and heats the town. The town's power station (area L6) generates electricity that powers streetlamps in every district, although the streetlamps have gone out in Cavemouth. These lights can be switched on or off from control consoles in the power station and the security center (area L12).

#### Magma

Any creature that falls into Little Lockford's magma lake is likely to be killed instantly unless that creature is immune to fire damage. Any creature that enters the magma for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 55 (10d10) fire damage.

#### Slagline

Suspended above the magma lake is a carousel-like chain of dangling steel buckets called the Slagline. The buckets are spaced 15 feet apart. Roughly half of them contain ore and uncut gems from the mines; the rest are empty and big enough to carry five Small creatures or two Medium creatures each.

The Slagline is automated so that the buckets move counterclockwise around the town. (Normally, ore and gems from the Cavemouth district are received at the foundry in the Smoldertown district for smelting and refining. The processed materials are then transported past Turbine Heights to Old Lockford, where they are sold by merchants and guild artisans.) The Slagline alternates between running for 1 minute and then pausing for 1 minute to allow time to load and unload its buckets. Whenever the Slagline stops, the buckets suspended above the magma bob and sway slightly—not so much that they spill their contents, however.

Creatures can safely climb into buckets at one of four loading stations (two in Cavemouth, one in Smoldertown, and one in Old Lockford) and ride the Slagline from one district to another.

### Security Forces

Tockworth created two primary types of automatons to protect Little Lockford:

- **Clockwork Defenders** Little Lockford has twenty **clockwork defenders** (see their description and stat block at the end of the adventure), not including ones that were destroyed during the town's evacuation or the damaged one in area L6.
- **Clockwork Observers** Little Lockford has eight **clockwork observers** (see their description and stat block at the end of the adventure). The observers are tasked with monitoring the streets to ensure nothing has penetrated the city's defenses. If an observer detects intruders, it contacts Tockworth telepathically, letting her know where the intruders are. Tockworth then orders the observer to use its next action to emit a piercing shriek, which is loud enough to summon 1d4 **clockwork defenders** (see their description and stat block at the end of the adventure). These reinforcements arrive 2 rounds later. If the number of clockwork defenders summoned is greater than the number left in Little Lockford, adjust the number of reinforcements accordingly.

Other Constructs under Tockworth's control include two suits of **animated armor** (see area L9a) and a **shield guardian** that lost its master and its control amulet. The shield guardian stands guard outside Tockworth's workshop (area L9).

### Wandering Monsters

Each time one or more visible characters exit a building or enter a new district, roll a d6. On a roll of 1 or 2 (or just 1 if the characters are trying to be stealthy), they attract the attention of one or more wandering monsters determined by rolling another d6 and consulting the Wandering Monsters table. See "Security Forces" above for more information about how many clockwork defenders and clockwork observers are present in Little Lockford.

In the Cavemouth district, the monsters encountered have all crawled from the mines. The characters encounter Tockworth's automatons elsewhere.

##### Wandering Monsters
| d6  | Encounter in Cavemouth                  |    Encounter Elsewhere    |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------|:-------------------------:|
|  1  | 2 **darkmantles** following 1 **grick** | 3 **clockwork defenders** |
| 2–3 | 2 **gricks**                            | 2 **clockwork defenders** |
| 4–6 | 1 **shambling mound** made of fungi     | 1 **clockwork observer**  |

## Little Lockford Locations

The following locations are marked on map 5.2.

![Map 5.2: DM's map](img/adventure/KftGV/040-map-5.02-dms-map.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/KftGV/041-map-5.02-dms-map-player.webp)
### Old Lockford (Areas L1–L2)

Old Lockford is the oldest part of the town. The cobblestones here have been worn smooth over the centuries, and the streetlamps are wrought in a more ornate style than those in the rest of Little Lockford. A few dead deep gnomes lie in the streets; most wear the weapons and armor of the militia.

#### L1: Entrance and Gatehouse

When the characters are ready to enter the town, read or paraphrase the following:

>>Sergeant Cragknuckle leads you to a bulwark hastily erected outside Little Lockford's impressive gates. The bulwark is defended by weary-looking members of the town militia, who salute the sergeant as he limps past them.
>>
>>Standing watch by the gates are two dour gnomes in black robes. On Cragknuckle's signal, each of these gnomes casts a spell that causes the gates to swing open before you. A wave of heat washes through the bulwark as the gates part, revealing a grim town bathed in hellish light and periodically brightened by flashes of lightning.
>>

The outer gates lock automatically when they close. The two gnome mages on duty have prepared *knock* spells, which they use to circumvent the gates' complex locking mechanisms. It takes two *knock* spells to open the gates.

Sergeant Cragknuckle goes no farther. In Gnomish, he wishes the characters good luck, instructs them to knock on the gates seven times to signal that they're ready to exit, and assures them he will be here waiting for them. (If the characters don't speak his language, the sergeant raps his knuckles on the outer gates seven times to explain what they must do to signal for the gates to be opened.)

As soon as the characters enter the town, the gates lock behind them. True to his word, Sergeant Cragknuckle instructs the mages to open the gates if he hears someone on the other side knock on the gates seven times.

***Gatehouse.*** A modest gatehouse stands inside the gates. *Map 5.2* includes an inset map that shows the interior of the gatehouse, which the characters can use as a place to rest or regroup. The gatehouse contains sleeping quarters and an armory that was cleaned out during the evacuation.

#### L2: Town Hall

>>The bodies of three dead gnomes clad in the armor of the town militia splay on the front steps of the town hall, the doors to which are wide open.
>>

The town hall features a spacious chamber for large gatherings and has three small offices at the back.

***Treasure.*** From Mayor Broadfoot's office, characters can retrieve four *potions of healing*, two *flasks of alchemist's fire*, and one use of *dust of disappearance* in a small packet. These items are kept in an unlocked footlocker under the mayor's desk. On the desk is a *calligraphy set*.

### Halfway Isle (Area L3)

Halfway Isle used to be a giant stalagmite until the gnomes sheared off the top of it to create a plateau, atop which they built the Abbey of the Deep Brother (area L3). Bridges connect Halfway Isle to the neighboring districts of Old Lockford and Turbine Heights.

#### L3. Abbey of the Deep Brother

>>Next to the road stands a squat stone building capped with a stone dome. The building's entrance is a double door carved to resemble interlocking hands, and centered above the doorway is a golden pick with a short handle.
>>

*Map 5.2* includes an inset map that shows the interior of this building.

A character who examines the golden pick and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes it as the symbol of the Deep Brother, Callarduran Smoothhands, a god worshiped by svirfneblin (particularly miners and stone carvers).

***Abbey Interior.*** A 4-foot-tall statue of Callarduran, his face and figure hidden under a cowled robe, stands in an alcove just inside the entrance. The statue's right hand is held out, displaying stone-carved rings on every stubby finger.

The largest room in the abbey, directly across from the entrance, serves as a place of worship. Low benches face the middle of the domed chamber, where every word spoken—even a whisper—can be heard throughout the space. Skulking in the dark corners of this room are two prisoners who escaped the custody of their guards as they were being led from the jail (area L5) during the evacuation of Little Lockford. The two prisoners—a **goblin boss** named Slonk and a **bugbear** named Yuzzik—have manacles on their wrists and carry no weapons. Slonk was the leader of a gang of goblin brigands that preyed on travelers in the tunnels near Little Lockford. Yuzzik is Slonk's sole surviving bodyguard. Both are unscrupulous and will do almost anything to survive, short of betraying each other.

Other rooms in the abbey include sleeping quarters for svirfneblin monks, a private chamber for the abbot, and a privy. A search of these areas yields nothing of value.

***Abbot Kavoda.*** The abbot Kavoda tried to flee Little Lockford with his fellow monks, but he didn't get far before one of Tockworth's automatons chased him back to the abbey. Minutes after Kavoda returned to the abbey, Slonk and Yuzzik showed up. Kavoda avoided them by casting *meld into stone*. He has been using *meld into stone* spells to hide ever since. As the characters explore the abbey, Kavoda hears one of them and emerges from a nearby wall when he thinks it's safe to do so.

Kavoda is a chaotic good **deep gnome** who speaks Common, Gnomish, Terran, and Undercommon. His Innate Spellcasting trait includes the ability to cast *meld into stone* three times per day. He wears a gray robe instead of armor (AC 12) and carries a *spell scroll* of *magic weapon* and a *potion of giant strength (hill)*.

Kavoda doesn't want to stay in Little Lockford any longer. Desperate and hungry, he begs the characters to escort him safely to Little Lockford's outer gates (area L1), offering his magic items if they accept the quest. He insists they deliver him to the gates by the most direct route without delay, and he protests loudly if they dawdle or deviate from this course of action. If he is separated from the characters or wounded, Kavoda runs back to the abbey, crying "Callarduran, protect me!" all the way.

### Turbine Heights (Areas L4–L6)

Turbine Heights is where members of the militia and their families lived. This district also contains a power station and an infirmary.

When the characters first arrive at Turbine Heights, read the following text:

>>The streets of this district are filled with steam. Through the haze, you can see bright streetlamps and abandoned buildings. Every fifteen seconds, a bolt of electricity arcs from a metal tower in the middle of the district to similar towers in other districts.
>>

The electrically charged metal tower is attached to the roof of the power station (area L6). Due to a backup at the station, steam has overflowed into the streets of Turbine Heights. Consequently, the district is *lightly obscured*, as if by fog. A *gust of wind* spell rids a street of steam for 1 minute.

#### L4. Infirmary

>>A stone sign depicting a crutch hangs above the entrance to this one-story building. The double door below the sign is ajar, revealing a hallway beyond.
>>

Beyond the double door is a long, dark hallway with three small examination rooms on one side of it and three small storage rooms on the opposite side (see "Treasure" below). At the far end of the hall, behind another double door, is an operating room. Characters who search the infirmary thoroughly can find crutches and wheelchairs sized for gnomes, as well as bandages and other mundane medical supplies.

***Treasure.*** Characters who loot the storage rooms find six *healer's kits* and six *potions of healing*.

#### L5: Jail

>>This fortified, two-story stone edifice has a heavy iron door that hangs open. In front of the building, four dead gnomes in armor lie amid the fragments of a doglike automaton.
>>

The dead gnomes lying in the street are prison guards who were killed by Tockworth's automatons. The guards managed to destroy one of the clockwork defenders that attacked them, but the prisoners they were escorting slipped away (and ended up in area L3). Characters who search the corpses find a small ring of keys. These keys unlock all the cells in the jail.

***Building Interior.*** *Map 5.2* includes inset maps that show both floors of this two-story building. The lower floor contains a kitchen and mess hall for the jailers and an office reserved for the head jailer. A spiral staircase connects to the upper level, which contains prison cells.

#### L6: Power Station

>>A thirty-foot-tall metal tower extends from the rooftop of this blocky, one-story stone building. The tower crackles with electricity and spews clouds of steam. Every fifteen seconds, it discharges an arc of lightning that leaps to a tower in another district.
>>

The power station generates electricity that powers the bridges, the Slagline (see "General Features" earlier in the adventure), and various workshops scattered throughout the town. The electricity is transmitted through arc towers like the one rising from the power station's roof.

***Building Interior.*** *Map 5.2* includes an inset map that shows the power station's interior, which you can describe as follows:

>>The interior of the power station is one big room filled with billowing clouds of steam. Four howling turbines take up most of the floorspace. Iron steps lead to a six-foot-high iron balcony on the west side of the room. At the north end of the balcony is an iron ladder that climbs to a trapdoor in the roof. The balcony also supports a metal console.

***Damaged Turbine.*** A power station worker was cornered by a clockwork defender at the north end of the balcony and shoved the automaton off the balcony into the northwest turbine. One of the clockwork defender's hind legs became stuck in the turbine, causing the turbine to malfunction. Characters within 10 feet of the northwest turbine can see the damaged **clockwork defender**, which has 24 hit points remaining. This defender is restrained and unable to free itself, but it can attack creatures that come within reach of it.

Once the clockwork defender is defeated, a character can use an action to try to dislodge it from the turbine, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Removing the clockwork defender's mangled leg from the turbine's machinery causes the power station to stop spewing steam, with the steam throughout Turbine Heights dissipating 1d10 minutes later.

***Control Console.*** The metal console overlooking the turbines is inscribed with a map of the town. Next to this map are several switches: one for every bridge and district, one for the Slagline (see "General Features"), and one for the power station. All are described below:

- **Bridge Switches** There's one switch for each of Little Lockford's nine bridges. A bridge can be raised by turning its switch to the left or lowered by turning its switch to the right.
- **District Switches** There's one switch for each of Little Lockford's six districts (Cavemouth, Halfway Isle, Old Lockford, the Overlook, Smoldertown, and Turbine Heights). The streetlamps in a district can be shut off by turning that district's switch to the left or switched on by turning its switch to the right.
- **Slagline Switch** There's one switch for the Slagline. Turning it to the left shuts off the bucket chain. Turning it to the right switches the bucket chain on.
- **Station Shutdown Switch** Turning this switch to the left shuts down the turbines in the power station, causing the streetlamps to turn off throughout town, shutting down the Slagline, and preventing the town's bridges from being raised or lowered. Turning it to the right switches the power back on.

### Smoldertown (Areas L7–L9)

When the characters first enter this district, describe it as follows:

>>The acrid stench of hot metal hangs over this district. Buildings here have no decoration, and nearly every surface is caked in decades of grime and soot. A few more gnome bodies lie face-down in the grit.
>>

Smoldertown, with its many workshops and smithies, is the industrial heart of Little Lockford. Tockworth's workshop (area L9) is located here, but Tockworth herself is taking a break at the Motherlode Tavern (area L8).

#### L7: Foundry

>>The soot-stained foundry stands at the edge of this district, overlooking the magma lake far below. Its huge sliding doors stand open, revealing dark furnaces and silent machinery. A raised loading dock allows access to the dangling buckets of the Slagline, which deliver unrefined ore to the foundry.
>>

*Map 5.2* includes an inset map that shows the foundry's interior, which is one large, open space. The building has no ceiling, allowing heat and smoke to escape. Ore from the Slagline's buckets can be dumped via chute into any of the foundry's five large furnaces.

***Treasure.*** Characters who loot the foundry find three sets of *smith's tools* and two sets of *tinker's tools*.

#### L8: Motherlode Tavern

>>Hanging above the entrance of this grimy stone building is a painted wooden sign that depicts gemstones pouring from a flagon. A minor magical effect causes the gemstones to glitter invitingly.
>>

*Map 5.2* includes an inset map that shows the tavern's interior, which consists of a cellar and a taproom.

***Cellar.*** The cellar contains crates of worthless supplies, several kegs of a locally brewed mushroom beer called Rubbleclub Classic (named for its brewer, the svirfneblin Glyphy Rubbleclub), and several more kegs of an oaky whiskey called Oofenklanger's Finest (named after the family that originally distilled it).

***Taproom.*** The taproom contains seating areas, including a row of stools next to a low bar made of carved basalt. Hanging above the bar are two soot-stained lanterns with *continual flame* spells cast inside them. Half-drunk flagons of flat mushroom beer rest on the bar and on the tables, abandoned by patrons in their haste to evacuate Little Lockford.

***Tixie Tockworth.*** Unless she was defeated elsewhere, **Tixie Tockworth** (see her description and stat block at the end of the adventure) sits on the barstool farthest from the entrance, cradling an empty flagon while mumbling to herself.

The presence of intruders confuses, disturbs, and annoys Tockworth. If she is confronted by the characters here or if the *alarm* spell triggers on the safe in area L9b, she casts *dimension door* and steps through the spell's magical doorway into area L9b. As she leaves, she says, "Break time's over, Poots!" (The characters have no way to know this, but Poots is the name of an imaginary friend Tockworth invented in her childhood. This long-lost imaginary friend has resurfaced recently in response to Tockworth's mounting loneliness.)

#### L9: Tockworth's Workshop

>>This windowless, two-story structure has a single door tucked near a corner on the ground floor. Standing in front of the door is an eight-foot-tall, bipedal construct made of chipped stone, rusty metal, and green copper. Its heavy iron gauntlets are clenched into fists, and the ominous helm that forms its head turns slowly from side to side.
>>

***Shield Guardian.*** The construct blocking passage into Tockworth's workshop is a **shield guardian** that lacks the Spell Storing trait. Its creator and control amulet were destroyed long ago. Tockworth found a way to reanimate the shield guardian without having to create a new amulet, rendering the shield guardian autonomous. The shield guardian has been loyal to Tockworth ever since. It defends itself if attacked and attacks anyone who tries to slip past it. It is too big to fit through the workshop's front door.

***Workshop Interior.*** *Map 5.2* includes inset maps that show both floors of Tockworth's workshop, which are described in areas L9a and L9b.

![Animated suits of armor do much of the assembly work in Tockworth's workshop](img/adventure/KftGV/042-05-005.animated-suits-assembly.webp)

#### L9a: Workshop, Lower Floor

>>The ground floor is one big work area containing a smelter, drums filled with clockwork parts, and a dizzying array of tools. Mounted on one wall is an iron ladder that ends before a trapdoor in the ceiling.
>>
>>Inscribed on the floor is a complex geometric design that pulsates with light. In the middle of this design, embedded in the floor, is a one-foot-square metal box with a keyhole in the top of it.
>>

This workshop is where Tockworth creates her clockwork automatons. Two suits of **animated armor** named Rack and Pinion serve as her assistants and perform most of the hands-on work. These Constructs attack intruders on sight.

The workshop contains a smelter used to fabricate parts and tools. There are enough tools here to assemble one set of *smith's tools* and one set of *tinker's tools*.

The trapdoor in the ceiling opens into area L9b.

***Geometric Design.*** A *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the complex geometric symbol inscribed on the floor. When a creature other than Tockworth enters the space above the symbol for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature becomes the target of a *crown of madness* spell (save DC 15) that has a duration of 1 minute.

***Fail-Safe Device.*** If Tockworth's security key is inserted into the metal box embedded in the floor and turned counterclockwise, Little Lockford's clockwork defenders and clockwork observers are rendered unconscious indefinitely. Turning the key clockwise deactivates the magic of the geometric design on the floor and ends any ongoing effects of its magic. The security key is kept in Tockworth's safe (in area L9b).

#### L9b: Workshop, Upper Floor

>>The workshop's upper floor consists of a sparse room furnished with a simple cot and worktables covered in schematics. An iron safe, five feet on a side, stands against one wall, its thick metal door fitted with a combination lock and a handle.
>>

***Safe.*** The safe can't be moved, and a *detect magic* spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around it.

A character equipped with thieves' tools can spend 1 minute trying to crack open the safe door, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Alternatively, a character can spend 1 minute pressing their ear to the safe's door while trying to delicately pick its combination lock, opening the door with a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Wisdom (Perception) check. The safe door also opens when the proper command word ("Poots") is spoken within 5 feet of it. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens the safe.

***Tixie Tockworth.*** If the safe door is opened by any means other than speaking the proper command word, a mental *alarm* spell alerts **Tixie Tockworth** (see her description and stat block at the end of the adventure). Unless she was defeated in area L8, Tockworth uses a *dimension door* spell to appear in the middle of the room and attacks any burglars she sees.

If Tockworth is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, she uses her next action to cast *dimension door* again, then steps through the doorway into area L12.

***Treasure.*** The safe contains an onyx-studded jewelry box worth 250 gp. The box is unlocked and holds the following items:

- Zircon ring (60 gp)
- Three *amethysts* (100 gp each)
- The security key to the fail-safe device in area L9a (the key is 8 inches long, made of brass, and decorated with clockwork designs)

### Cavemouth (Areas L10–L11)

When the characters first enter Cavemouth, read the following text:

>>Mining equipment lies abandoned in the alleys and stalagmite-lined streets of this gloomy district.
>>

The Cavemouth district is where most of Little Lockford's miners live and work. Two roads lead to the mines, which are not shown on *map 5.2*.

The bridges to Cavemouth have been raised, and the streetlamps throughout the district have been shut off. The characters can lower the bridges and turn on the streetlamps using a control console in area L6 or area L12.

***Mines.*** The mine entrances, once protected by Tockworth's automatons, are now unguarded. The mines are beyond the scope of the adventure. If the characters insist on exploring them, they eventually attract the attention of a wandering **cloaker** that tries to frighten them away with haunting moans.

#### L10: Miners' Guildhall

>>Hanging above the open doorway of this large, gem-studded building is a stone sign depicting a pick and a hammer.
>>

The miners' guildhall has offices for senior guild members, stout metal lockers where miners can store their gear, and functional showers. Most of the building's former occupants vacated in a hurry, leaving sundry equipment scattered about.

***Guildmaster Deepdelve.*** A thorough search of the building reveals the corpse of a robed deep gnome named Schnella Deepdelve, the master of the town's miners' guild. Schnella refused to leave and died fending off Tockworth's clockwork defenders. Her restless soul lurks in this building, manifesting as a troublesome **specter** known as a **poltergeist** (see the "Variant: Poltergeist" sidebar in the "Specter" entry of the *Monster Manual*).

Characters who disturb the body or spend more than 1 minute in the guildhall anger the poltergeist, which hurls picks and iron spikes at them until they leave or until the poltergeist is destroyed. The poltergeist is invisible and can't speak.

#### L11: Warehouse 6

>>Bright light seeps through cracks around the sliding metal doors of this otherwise nondescript warehouse.
>>

If the characters slide open the doors, read:

>>The interior of the warehouse is an open space roughly twenty feet wide and thirty feet long. Parked in the middle of the warehouse is a strange metal vehicle with treads. Quartz gemstones embedded in the hull shine light in all directions. Mounted to the front of this contraption is a large, cone-shaped drill. At the rear of the contraption is a closed, three-foot-square steel hatch. Two dead gnomes in armor lie on the floor next to the vehicle and a puddle of oil.
>>

The dead gnomes are two **mimics** that attack anyone who touches or otherwise disturbs them. The mimics are working with a **psychic gray ooze** (see the "Variant: Psychic Gray Ooze" sidebar in the "Oozes" entry of the *Monster Manual*)—the "puddle of oil" mentioned above. The gray ooze and the mimics recently crept into the warehouse and are waiting for food to come to them.

***Contraption.*** The vehicle in the warehouse is a Large, magical drilling machine used by the miners of Little Lockford to burrow new tunnels. The vehicle has the properties of an *apparatus of Kwalish*, with these changes:

- **Treads** Instead of legs and a tail, it has treads that give it a walking speed of 30 feet.
- **Burrowing Speed** Instead of a swimming speed, it has a burrowing speed of 10 feet. Using its drill, it can burrow through solid rock, leaving a 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-high tunnel behind it.
- **Lever 1** Moving lever 1 to the up position starts the drill. Moving the same lever to the down position shuts off the drill.
- **Lever 9** Moving lever 9 to the up position causes the contraption to move backward at its walking speed. Moving the same lever to the down position stops its backward movement.

***Ignus Flint.*** An inventor named Ignus Flint (lawful neutral, deep gnome **mage** who speaks Common, Gnomish, Terran, and Undercommon) built the contraption and recently locked himself inside it with enough food and water to keep himself alive for 1 week. A metal hatch at the back of the vehicle is the only entrance, and Ignus used a *spell scroll* of *arcane lock* to seal it. A character can use an action to try to pull open the magically sealed hatch, doing so with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. If the characters knock on the contraption, they hear Ignus's muffled voice shout, "Go away!" in Gnomish. Ignus attacks anyone who breaks into his contraption but surrenders if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer.

Ignus and Tockworth are rivals, and Ignus long suspected Tockworth's experiments would prove troublesome for Little Lockford. His public warnings about Tockworth went ignored, however. A character can use an action to try to convince Ignus to help them, first by impressing on him the importance of freeing Little Lockford from Tockworth's control and then by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Once coaxed into helping the characters, Ignus pilots his contraption anywhere they need him to go. The vehicle has enough space inside for Ignus plus one other passenger. If a character asks Ignus to allow the party to drive the contraption, he adamantly refuses to part with his prized invention.

***Questioning Ignus.*** Ignus knows the following useful information about Tockworth and her workshop, which he shares with characters who befriend him:

- **Animated Armor** Two suits of animated armor help Tockworth assemble her other contraptions.
- **Safe** Tockworth has an iron safe on the upper floor of her workshop.
- **Shield Guardian** Tockworth found a way to animate a derelict shield guardian and now uses it to guard the front door to her workshop. The guardian is too big to fit through the door. (Ignus covets the shield guardian and wishes he had one of his own.)
- **Who Is Poots?** When Tockworth is upset, she speaks to an imaginary friend named Poots—as if Poots were standing right next to her. (Ignus doesn't know that "Poots" is also the command word to bypass the *alarm* spell on Tockworth's safe.)

### The Overlook (Area L12)

When the characters are close enough to see the Overlook, describe it as follows:

>>The central feature of Little Lockford is an enormous, hollowed-out stalactite with luminous clock faces built into it.
>>

The Overlook's clocks are mechanical wonders illuminated by magic. They keep perfect time.

A hollowed-out central chamber in the Overlook contains Little Lockford's security center (area L12). This facility is surrounded by rough-hewn chambers containing magnificent fungi gardens and open windows overlooking the town. Residents of Little Lockford used to come here to wander the gardens, pick mushrooms, and enjoy the views.

Characters can use the control consoles in areas L6 and L12 to raise and lower the bridges that connect the Overlook to the districts of Old Lockford, Smoldertown, and Turbine Heights.

#### L12: Security Center

>>A large, rough-hewn cavern in the heart of the Overlook has a floor that rises toward the middle. Scores of lizards—a few of them big enough to ride as mounts—sleep and crawl on the slopes of this natural rise. Perched atop the rocky mound is a squat stone building topped with a crystal dome. Multicolored light gleams within the dome.
>>

The cavern is home to six **giant lizards** and hundreds of ordinary **lizards**, all of which are docile but skittish. The giant ones are trained to serve the svirfneblin as pack animals. A character who approaches a giant lizard can use an action to try to keep it from running away, doing so with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. A giant lizard that doesn't run away can be used by that character as a mount.

***Domed Building.*** *Map 5.2* provides an inset map of the security center. Spiral staircases on the north and south sides of the building climb 15 feet to a circular chamber, which you can describe to the players as follows:

>>Beneath a fifteen-foot-high crystal dome is a chamber containing a ten-foot-square, three-dimensional projection of Little Lockford. Rising from the floor near the projection is a metal console with numerous switches on it.
>>

***Control Console.*** The console functions like the one in the power station (area L6).

***Magical Projection.*** The projection of Little Lockford is a harmless illusion that changes to match the current state of things in town; for example, if a bridge is lowered in Little Lockford, the projection's version of the bridge lowers as well. The projection has no substance, allowing creatures to pass right through it.

***Tixie Tockworth.*** If she fled to this chamber using *dimension door*, **Tixie Tockworth** (see her description and stat block at the end of the adventure) is next to the console. She has attached an experimental jet pack to her body, giving her a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover. She accuses the characters of being pawns and mocks their heroics. She occasionally speaks to an imaginary friend named Poots, saying things like, "We'll show them, Poots!" and "No one can stop us!"

If Tockworth is reduced to 0 hit points, her jet pack explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere, blowing Tockworth to smithereens. Every other creature within that sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (3d10) piercing damage from flying shrapnel. If the explosion occurs under the crystal dome, the dome shatters, showering creatures in the room with harmless, confetti-sized quartz particles.

## Conclusion

Once the characters use the security key to activate the fail-safe device and shut down Tockworth's automatons, the major threat to the city is ended.

Little Lockford's residents feel a mixture of grief and relief when they return to the town. They are grateful to the characters for saving the town and raise statues in the characters' honor. Furthermore, Mayor Broadfoot gives the characters their promised rewards (see "Rewards" earlier in the adventure), and invites the characters to stay in Little Lockford as long as they wish and return as often as they can.

### For the Golden Vault

If the characters are working for the Golden Vault, the organization's representative is waiting with Mayor Broadfoot to confirm the automatons were shut down. Once the representative confirms the characters' success, the organization rewards them with a rare magic item of their choice (subject to your approval) as payment. The item is delivered to the characters the next day. This reward is in addition to the treasures promised by Mayor Broadfoot.
