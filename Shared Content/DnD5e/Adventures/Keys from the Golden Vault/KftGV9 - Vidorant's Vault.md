# Vidorant's Vault

*An Adventure for 7th-Level Characters*

Over the years, the notorious elf thief Nixylanna Vidorant has stolen many famed prizes and stored them in her vault. Her former partner believes one of these trophies—a ruby diadem—rightly belongs to him. He hires the characters to infiltrate Vidorant's vault, bypass its security features, and steal the diadem. In a twist, the characters come face-to-face with Vidorant, and she offers them a deal that's hard to refuse.

## Adventure Background

![](img/adventure/KftGV/060-08-002.ch8-key.webp)

The Silver Fingers Society is no mere guild of pickpockets and ruffians. The elite thieves of this multinational organization pull off impossible heists, targeting crown jewels, national secrets, and other heavily guarded prizes. Decades ago, the elf Nixylanna Vidorant joined the Silver Fingers, where she partnered with a dwarf named Samphith Goldenbeard. These friendly rivals made a good pair. Vidorant was skilled with picking locks and deftly getting into tough places, and Goldenbeard used his connections and quick thinking to research targets and talk the pair's way out of trouble.

As the years passed, the duo rose in the ranks of the Silver Fingers. But their partnership abruptly ended when they stole the Ruby Diadem, an heirloom once worn by Queen Erlynn Blessedore. Goldenbeard's family traces its lineage to the dwarven queen, who was captured in a battle centuries ago, and he desperately wanted to reclaim his family's diadem. The heist seemed like any other—until thirty guards suddenly surrounded the pair of thieves. Vidorant nimbly escaped via the roof with the diadem in hand, but Goldenbeard was caught. He avoided imprisonment by calling in favors with powerful friends, but when he tracked down Vidorant, she refused to hand over the diadem despite his family's claim to it.

Goldenbeard claimed Vidorant set him up and alerted the authorities. Meanwhile, Vidorant claimed innocence, insisting Goldenbeard was covering for his own inability to escape the situation. Whatever the truth, she kept the diadem, the once-friendly rivalry turned bitter, and the two have tried to outmaneuver each other ever since.

Recently, their uneasy relationship changed again with the death of the longtime leader of the Silver Fingers Society. Vidorant and Goldenbeard each competed to win leadership of the society, calling in favors from every ally they had in the organization. Unfortunately for Vidorant, Goldenbeard proved defter at internal politics, winning leadership of the society—and getting Vidorant expelled in the process. Goldenbeard promised harsh retaliation against anyone who helped Vidorant, ensuring none of her former allies would stand against him.

Weeks after his takeover of the Silver Fingers Society, Goldenbeard made an even bigger move against Vidorant. He promised a favor to any existing or aspiring Silver Finger who steals the Ruby Diadem of Erlynn Blessedore and delivers it to him. This challenge is the talk of scoundrel circles as everyone vies to steal the diadem from Vidorant. Doing so won't be easy, as Vidorant keeps her treasures in her secure vault on the outskirts of the city.

## Using the Golden Vault

If you're using the Golden Vault as a patron, a golden key is delivered to the characters in whatever manner you deem fit. When the characters use this key to open their music box, the lid pops open and a soothing voice says the following:

>>"Greetings, operatives. An heirloom diadem from a dwarven queen is in the possession of master thief Nixylanna Vidorant. The queen's descendant, Samphith Goldenbeard, would like the diadem returned, and the Golden Vault finds value in allying with his Silver Fingers Society. This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you to infiltrate Vidorant's vault and recover the diadem. Start by meeting with Goldenbeard. Good luck, operatives."
>>

Closing the music box causes the golden key to vanish.

## Steal the Diadem

To kick off this adventure, the characters receive an invitation to meet with the head of the Silver Fingers Society, Samphith Goldenbeard (lawful neutral, dwarf **noble**). A character who is a thief or has the criminal background is familiar with the Silver Fingers Society, an elite organization for exceptional thieves.

Alternatively, the characters could hear about Goldenbeard's challenge to bring him the diadem through the gossip of other thieves; in this case, skip to the "Preparation" section.

If the characters are too lawful or good to work with a thieves' guild, consider Goldenbeard approaching them simply as a descendant of Erlynn Blessedore, asking them to return the Ruby Diadem to its rightful heirs.

### Mission from Goldenbeard

Goldenbeard asks the characters to meet with him in the back room of a restaurant, the Spoke and Wheel. When the party arrives, read the following:

>>An elegantly dressed dwarf greets you in the back room of the Spoke and Wheel, a polite smile gracing his face. He introduces himself as Goldenbeard and offers you tea. After everyone is served, he casually dips a pinky into his own cup and tastes a drop before taking a larger sip.
>>

Once the characters sit down near him, Goldenbeard addresses them:

>>"It's a pleasure to meet you all. I'm sure you've heard of my organization, the Silver Fingers Society. Only the most elite thieves in the world qualify for membership.
>>
>>"You may have heard that Nixylanna Vidorant, my former partner, is no longer with the Silver Fingers. We've withdrawn all protection from her and her property, and we now have room in the society for new members.
>>
>>"As such, I present to you a challenge. Whoever brings me the Ruby Diadem of Erlynn Blessedore from Nixylanna's personal vault will become a member of the society. As my family is descended from Queen Erlynn, we've wanted the diadem returned to us for years.
>>
>>"You can keep a few things for yourself from her collection, but I'd advise against too much distraction. Nixylanna has been a problem for me for a long time because she is very good at what she does. And remember: you cannot trust her."
>>

Goldenbeard relates the information from "Adventure Background"—though told from his perspective. He explains the diadem is of only moderate value and has no magical properties, but its connection to his family and his history with Vidorant make it valuable to him.

If the characters are uninterested in membership in the Silver Fingers, Goldenbeard offers a reward of 2,000 gp, though he grumbles the reward is far more than the diadem is worth.

## Preparation

The party's preparation for the heist might include seeking information from Vidorant's former guards, surveilling Vidorant at her mansion, or staking out her vault. Though each approach can yield useful information, the characters shouldn't delay too much; other Silver Fingers may also be preparing to steal the diadem (at your discretion).

### Gathering Intelligence

By combing through local pubs or asking around with their own informants, the characters can locate up to six guards (**veterans**) formerly employed by Vidorant. Use the Former Guards table to help you roleplay each guard.

##### Former Guards
| d6 | Ex-Guard                                                                                                          |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Turolga Flathelm (neutral dwarf), a gruff woman who has a soft spot for stray cats                                |
| 2  | Ballidyr Josephon (neutral human), a pompous man who refers to himself in the third person                        |
| 3  | Jeniana Damaritz (lawful neutral human), an aloof woman who talks to only the most well-dressed of the characters |
| 4  | Pelten Kiwaris (chaotic neutral human), a gregarious person who invites the characters to join them at a party    |
| 5  | Kavton Bouldersight (neutral halfling), a jocular man who sells stolen goods                                      |
| 6  | Breelen Fibblezot (chaotic neutral gnome), a cheerful woman who fidgets constantly                                |

To convince a former guard to share information about the vault and its defenses, a character can make a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check or another appropriate ability check, depending on their approach. A character who offers a bribe of 10 gp reduces the DC of this check by 5.

On a failed check, the former guard walks away, disinterested in further conversation. If other characters approach the guard later, the guard remains unwilling to share information about the vault.

On a successful check, the character convinces the former guard to reveal the basic layout of the vault's first floor, as shown on map 8.1. The guard also answers simple questions about Vidorant and her physical appearance, the guard uniforms, and other information every guard would know.

If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also learns one of the following pieces of information:

- The basic layout of the vault's second floor, as shown on map 8.1
- The location of the secret door between area T3 and the building's exterior
- The password to bypass the conjuration rune in area T9: "quixotic"
- The location of a switch to disable one trap (either the pit trap in area T3 or the statues in area T6)
- The guard rotation (detailed in "Vault Guards")

![Map 8.1: Players' Map](img/adventure/KftGV/061-08-003.players-map.webp)

### Surveilling the Target

If the characters spy on Vidorant, they can find her at her mansion in a well-to-do neighborhood near the vault. This doesn't yield useful information about the vault, but the characters can get a good glimpse of Vidorant and several associates, which can aid the characters in creating disguises.

Vidorant is a tall elf woman with sleek black hair. She usually wears black clothes accented with tasteful but clearly valuable silver jewelry. She's brusque, authoritative, and direct, though she listens with remarkable patience and intensity whenever anyone addresses her directly.

While no one in the Silver Fingers Society would dare help Vidorant right now, she still has a few informants and cronies from outside the organization. If the characters watch her long enough, they see meetings with four people: a muscular half-orc woman in a fine suit and hat, a sneering human man carrying a large leather case, an unkempt halfling man with patched clothing, and a smiling elf woman who bears a striking resemblance to Vidorant but is noticeably younger. Learning the identities of these associates would take additional sleuthing.

### Casing the Joint

If the characters scout the vault before the heist, read or paraphrase the following:

>>The vault stands in a rundown neighborhood, but the street and alleyways around the vault are unobstructed. Small windows glint from high on the vault's stone walls. Two guards keep watch on the second-floor balcony, while another guard patrols around the structure at ground level.
>>

Vidorant's vault is an unmarked building on the city outskirts in an area with moderate foot traffic. The neighboring buildings stand at least 20 feet from the vault and don't share walls with it. Nearby businesses include a jewelry store, a lumberyard, a brewery, and a forge. Several other nearby buildings are empty and are ideal locations for a stakeout.

If the characters observe the vault before the heist, they learn the general exterior layout, including the locations of the main door, balcony door, and windows. They also get a good look at the guard uniforms—dark blue with gold stitching—which can aid in creating disguises.

If the characters venture within 30 feet of the south side of the building, they hear animal noises coming from the zoo (area T8), and a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check finds the secret door leading from the exterior to the gem room (area T3).

If the characters observe the vault for at least 4 hours, they learn two guards are always on duty on the balcony, accessed via a rope ladder the guards leave hanging down to ground level. The characters also learn the basic exterior and interior guard rotation (detailed in "Vault Guards").

## The Vault

On the day (or night) of the heist, nothing notable has changed from the party's previous surveillance. If the characters didn't visit the vault earlier during their preparations, read the read-aloud text from "Casing the Joint" as they approach the vault.

### Vault Features

Vidorant's vault has the following features.

#### Ceilings

Ceilings throughout the vault are 15 feet high.

#### Doors

Doors in the vault are made of wood, except for the inner vault's metal door.

***Locked Doors.*** As an action, a character can try to unlock a locked door in the vault, doing so with a successful Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or force the door open with a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Either check's DC is 15 unless the text states otherwise.

#### Light

Unless otherwise noted, all areas are brightly lit by lamps imbued with *continual flame* spells.

#### Walls and Floors

The vault's walls and floors are made of thick stone. The characters can use the *stone shape* spell or similar magic to create a passage into the vault, though a guard patrol spots them if the characters spend more than a minute getting everyone inside. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 15, 200 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Damaging the wall catches the attention of the guards unless the characters take extraordinary measures.

#### Wards

The building is warded against teleportation and planar travel. Effects like the *dimension door* spell can't be used to enter, exit, or move within the building.

#### Windows

Areas T2, T3, T7, T8, and T9 have windows 10 feet above the ground, and area T13 has a window 20 feet above the ground. Each window is locked and can be unlocked easily from the inside. As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to unlock a window from the outside, doing so with a successful DC 16 Dexterity check.

Each window is warded with an abjuration rune that sounds an audible alarm if the window opens (see "Caught in the Act"). A character who searches a window for traps notices the rune with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check and can use an action to try to disable it, doing so with a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a *dispel magic* spell. A character who disables the alarm on one window can do the same on other vault windows without having to repeat the check.

The windows are too small for a Medium creature to climb through, but a Small creature can squeeze through one with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

### Vault Guards

Vidorant employs a dozen guards (use the **veteran** stat block) to protect her treasures—three guards outside and nine inside the vault. Guards remain alert for noises elsewhere in the vault, and if the characters do something particularly loud, a guard might investigate at your discretion.

#### Exterior Security

Characters who learned the guard rotation in the "Preparation" section know two guards are posted on the balcony and one guard patrols around the outside of the building at ground level.

A character can avoid the notice of the exterior guards with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check. An effective distraction might lower the DC or even bypass this check entirely. At night, the DC of this check decreases to 9.

#### Interior Security

Characters who learned the guard rotation in the "Preparation" section know two guards are posted in the lobby, seven guards patrol the first floor of the vault, and no guards patrol upstairs.

Rather than requiring you to track each patrolling guard's location, this adventure represents the guards moving about the vault by having you roll to determine whether a guard is present in any given room. In areas specified as part of the guard rotation, roll a d4 to determine if a guard is present when the characters approach that room. On a 1, a guard is present in that room. If the characters learned the guard rotation in the "Preparation" section, roll a d6 instead of a d4, reflecting their increased ability to avoid the guards.

If the characters spend more than 10 minutes in any room that's part of the guard rotation, a guard interrupts them. Any character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher hears the guard coming 2 rounds before the guard enters the room.

#### Evading Guards

When guards are present in an area, characters can resolve encounters without resorting to combat. Some examples are listed below, though the characters may come up with creative alternatives:

- **Bluffing** A character can lie their way past a guard with a successful DC 16 Charisma (Deception) check. If the party's preparations convincingly support their story—such as wearing guard uniforms while claiming they're new guards—the DC decreases to 12.
- **Bribing** A character can convince a guard to look the other way with a 50 gp bribe and a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check.
- **Hiding** Before entering a room, a character can tell if a guard is present by listening at the door and succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The party can make a DC 14 group Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide in their current room until the guards leave. On a successful check, the guard leaves without noticing the characters, allowing the party to enter the next room undetected. On a failed check, the guard discovers the characters, likely by entering the room the characters are in and spotting them.
- **Intimidation** A character can frighten a guard into letting them pass with a successful DC 17 Charisma (Intimidation) check.

If you wish, a character who succeeds on one of the above checks by 5 or more might also learn one piece of information from the "Gathering Intelligence" section, perhaps by overhearing a conversation or persuading a guard to share it.

#### Caught in the Act

If the characters are spotted by a guard and don't talk their way out of it, the guard yells loudly for backup and attempts to run away, taking the Dash action. The guard returns 3 rounds later with an additional 1d4 + 1 guards (unless there aren't that many guards left). The guards (use the **veteran** stat block) fight until reduced to 10 hit points, then flee.

If the characters set off any audible alarms in the building, a guard immediately investigates, arriving 3 rounds after the alarm sounds. The alarm also puts the guards on high alert throughout the vault. For 1 hour after an alarm sounds, when rolling to determine if a guard is present in a room, roll two dice instead of one; if either result is a 1, a guard is present. Additionally, the DC on checks made to nonviolently deal with guards increases by 2 (see "Evading Guards"), and the price to bribe a guard increases to 100 gp.

#### Changing of the Guard

If the characters neutralize all nine interior guards, the party has the run of the building until the next shift's guards show up. However, the three guards outside the building remain alert to loud noises inside the vault and enter the building to investigate suspicious sounds. A new shift starts every four hours, and six guards show up at each shift change.

### Vault Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 8.2.

![Map 8.2: DM's Map](img/adventure/KftGV/062-map-8.02-dms-map.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/KftGV/063-map-8.02-dms-map-player.webp)
#### T1: Lobby

>>This beautifully decorated lobby has stone floors polished to a mirror finish. To the west, a large statue depicts a human woman wielding a bow and arrow. To the east, two comfortable chairs accompany a small table. A double door leads outside to the north, and two doors on the south wall lead into the vault.
>>

***Guards.*** Two guards watch the unlocked front door while sitting in the lobby's chairs. Though suspicious of people trying to get in, they're accustomed to confused people occasionally entering the unmarked building.

***Locked Door.*** The door to area T5 is locked.

#### T2: Break Room

>>This break room smells faintly of sweat and greasy food. Scuffed wooden furniture and a large couch provide comfort for off-duty guards.
>>

The room includes a table and chairs for eating, a couch and several chairs for lounging, and a privy. A trunk on the east wall contains a dozen spare guard uniforms.

***Guards.*** Two off-duty guards are playing cards at the table. They aren't expecting to be interrupted, and each has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 7. If the characters try a nonviolent approach (as detailed in the "Evading Guards" section), the DC of those checks decreases by 2 against the off-duty guards.

***Locked Door.*** The door to area T3 is locked. Each guard in the vault has a key that unlocks this door.

#### T3: Gem Room

>>This room contains open crates of gems sorted by color and type. Most are neatly faceted, though a few remain uncut.
>>

***Guards.*** This room is part of the guard rotation. Roll to determine if a guard is present (as described in "Interior Security").

***Locked Door.*** The door to area T2 is locked. Each guard in the vault has a key that unlocks this door.

***Secret Door.*** The southwest wall of this room contains a secret door to the exterior. Vidorant uses this door often. A character who examines the wall and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the door, which opens silently.

***Trap.*** Any character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher notices the floor is unusually clean in a 10-foot square in front of the gem crates. When a creature steps on this area, the floor collapses into a 10-foot-deep pit with poisoned spikes lining its floor. Any creature on the collapsing floor falls into the pit, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. In addition, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be impaled by 1d3 spikes, each of which deals 3 (1d6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

A character who searches the floor for traps and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check detects the trap, which can be disabled by placing a strong object such as a pole or crowbar between the floor panels. If the check made to detect the trap succeeds by 5 or more, the character also spots a concealed switch on one wall that disables the trap.

***Treasure.*** The crates hold 60 pounds of gemstones. The valuable gems include a large uncut diamond (1,000 gp), four small diamonds (100 gp each), a bag of diamond dust (300 gp), four flawed rubies (50 gp each), and four *pearls* (100 gp each). The remainder of the semiprecious stones in the crates are worth a total of 1,000 gp.

#### T4: Scrolls and Potions Room

>>This room has four short bookshelves, each bearing eight glass vials of liquid. Several open barrels hold rolled-up sheets of parchment.
>>

***Guards.*** This room is part of the guard rotation. Roll to determine if a guard is present (as described in "Interior Security").

***Shelves of Potions.*** The four shelves each hold eight potions in vials (see "Treasure" below). Any character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 18 or higher notices the shelves are precariously balanced. To safely remove a potion from a shelf, someone must steady the shelf with a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check or the shelf collapses, shattering all the potion vials on it. Each creature within 5 feet of a collapsing shelf must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The noise alerts the guards in the lobby (area T1), who arrive 2 rounds later to investigate.

***Treasure.*** The shelves contain twenty-six *vials of acid*, a *potion of animal friendship*, two *potions of healing (greater)*, two *potions of resistance* (one *fire*, the other *poison*), and one *potion of water breathing*.

The sheets of parchment in the barrels include *spell scrolls* for each of the following spells: *charm person* (2 scrolls), *cure wounds* (1 scroll), *detect magic* (2 scrolls), *dispel magic* (1 scroll), *false life* (1 scroll), *identify* (4 scrolls), *invisibility* (1 scroll), *lesser restoration* (2 scrolls), and *nondetection* (1 scroll).

#### T5: Documents Room

>>This room holds two large iron safes.
>>

***Guards.*** This room is part of the guard rotation. Roll to determine if a guard is present (as described in "Interior Security").

***Locked Door.*** The door to area T1 is locked. Each guard in the vault has a key that unlocks this door.

***Trapped Safes.*** The two document safes in this room contain secret information about local nobles and government officials. Each safe is trapped with enchantment magic. If a creature attempts to open a safe without Vidorant's personal key, the safe's trap emits an audible alarm (see "Caught in the Act") and casts *hold person* (save DC 16) on the three creatures nearest the safe. A character who uses an action to search the safe for traps notices the trap's rune with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Once the trap is detected, a character can use an action to try to disarm the trap, doing so with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a *dispel magic* spell.

A character using thieves' tools can try to unlock a safe, which takes 1 minute. At the end of that time, the character must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity check, or the safe remains locked. The safes are full of documents. Every minute a character spends looking through the documents yields one of the following:

- **Bribe** A tattered parchment details how a prisoner, jailed for stealing racehorses, was freed after a noble bribed a local government official.
- **Disputed Will** A parchment bears the original will of a recently deceased local noble. As the noble's family members are currently fighting over the estate, this will would be of great value to the heirs named in it.
- **Goldenbeard's Secret** Small scraps of parchment hold notes from Goldenbeard. Though Vidorant's half of the correspondence is absent, the notes suggest Vidorant and Goldenbeard plotted a fake heist and used their "breathtaking success" to gain entrance to the Silver Fingers Society. Vidorant didn't use this information while vying for control of the Silver Fingers, as it implicated her too, but nothing would stop her from using it now.
- **Love Letters** Several perfumed envelopes hold romantic letters between a local noble and a government official. The affair would be a scandal if revealed.

None of the documents in the safe have intrinsic monetary value, though they could be used to gain money or influence through blackmail.

#### T6: Gallery

>>Landscape paintings cover the walls of this room. In the center of the floor stand two marble statues of a human man and woman, both holding musical instruments. One statue faces the door to the south, and the other faces the door to the west.
>>

***Fire-Breathing Statues.*** When a creature steps on a square marked T on *map 8.2*, the statue closest to that square breathes magical fire, which fills the two squares between the statue and the door nearest to it. Any creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As an action, a character can search a trapped area and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If this check succeeds, the character finds a tiny switch on the wall next to the nearest door. Flipping the switch temporarily disables whichever statue breathes fire toward that door. The trap reactivates 1 minute later.

***Guards.*** This room is part of the guard rotation. Roll to determine if a guard is present (as described in "Interior Security"). Guards enter the room only via its secret passage, and they leave through either of the main doors after flipping the switch to temporarily disable the traps.

***Secret Door.*** A character who inspects the paintings and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers a large painting on the east wall pivots—along with the bookshelf on the other side of the wall—revealing a secret way to area T9.

***Treasure.*** Four 12-foot-wide paintings (400 gp each) and a smaller 2-foot-wide painting (1,000 gp) are on display. A character who examines them and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the small painting is by a famous artist and is significantly more valuable than the others.

#### T7: Armory

>>Three suits of armor stand against the walls with swords in hand, watching over this armory. Three large chests sit along the south wall.
>>

The two easternmost suits of armor are **helmed horrors**. They attack creatures (other than Vidorant) that aren't wearing guard uniforms. They obey Vidorant's spoken commands. If she's not present, they obey anyone wearing a guard uniform, even if commanded to attack another guard. They don't leave this room, and they ignore orders that would cause them to do so.

***Guards.*** This room is part of the guard rotation. Roll to determine if a guard is present (as described in "Interior Security").

***Treasure.*** The chests hold more weapons. Most of the equipment in this room is nonmagical, but a character who is proficient with smith's tools or who succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check immediately spots the most finely crafted items: a *+1 battleaxe*, a *+1 shortsword*, and a suit of *+1 scale mail*.

#### T8: Zoo

>>This room contains five large cages holding unusual creatures. It smells of fur and feathers. Chirps, grunts, and howls fill the air.
>>

***Cages.*** Each cage has a door held shut by a rudimentary latch. One contains exotic birds. Another holds two **giant lizards** and six **flying snakes**. A third contains harmless mammals, including jerboas, chinchillas, and a capybara. The last two cages each hold one **displacer beast**. The giant lizards, flying snakes, and displacer beasts are aggressive but accustomed to being placated with food by Vidorant and the guards.

***Guards.*** This room is part of the guard rotation. Roll to determine if a guard is present (as described in "Interior Security"). Any guard in this room carries food for the animals.

#### T9: Library

>>This room smells strongly of incense and paper. It has several bookshelves filled with antique books. A large, embroidered rug covers the floor.
>>

A character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 18 or higher notices a conjuration rune peeking from under the rug. After discovering it, a character can use an action to try to disable the rune, doing so with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a *dispel magic* spell.

If a creature steps on the rug without saying the password, "quixotic," the rune summons an **invisible stalker**. The invisible stalker doesn't reveal its presence or attack immediately, waiting to do so until the characters either remove a book from the room or try to cross the spiked pit in area T10.

***Guards.*** This room is part of the guard rotation. Roll to determine if a guard is present (as described in "Interior Security"). The guard uses the password if forced to step onto the rug.

***Secret Door.*** A character who inspects the bookshelves and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers the bookshelf to the west pivots—along with the painting on the other side—revealing a secret way to the gallery (area T6).

***Treasure.*** Most books in this room have no monetary value, but three of the oldest books are worth 500 gp each. A character can identify these valuable books if they spend 5 minutes examining them and succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (History) check:

*Adventures of the Mystique* (first edition, mint condition) is a transcription of a first mate's logbook, which recounts several harrowing adventures aboard a galleon called the Mystique.

*The Diabolical Codex* (covered in spined devil hide), written by a tiefling named Nadir, provides tips and tricks for surviving bargains with devils.

*Eight for Dinner* (first edition, signed by the author) is a murder mystery in which an inquisitive mind flayer detective solves a murder aboard a planar locomotive called the Concordant Express.

#### T10: Pit

>>A ten-foot-wide pit with spikes at the bottom divides this room from east to west. A sturdy-looking stone bridge spans the pit. The room is dimly lit by a flickering lamp on the north wall. Near it, a double door leads west. On the south side of the pit is a spiral metal staircase going up.
>>

Guards don't patrol this room. If the **invisible stalker** was summoned in the library and hasn't attacked yet, it attempts to shove a character into the pit, then attacks the party.

***Illusions.*** Two permanent *silent image* spells have been cast over the pit, one on the east side and another on the west. The illusion on the west side depicts a bridge spanning the pit. The illusion on the east side shows an open pit, hiding a real bridge that can be used to safely cross. Touching the fake bridge (which is shown on *map 8.2*) reveals that it has no substance. Similarly, feeling around the pit for the real bridge reveals it in short order. Casting *dispel magic* on either illusion ends it.

***Spiked Pit.*** Any creature that falls into the pit is impaled by 1d3 spikes, each of which deals 3 (1d6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

#### T11a–b: Stairwell

>>A spiral metal staircase ascends gracefully, connecting the first and second floors. A flickering lamp casts dim light on the stairs.
>>

Guards don't patrol this area.

#### T12: Balcony

>>On the second floor's large balcony, a table and chairs allow for dining while enjoying a lovely view of the city. The view is unimpeded by a low railing. To the east, a rope ladder hangs from the balcony to the ground fifteen feet below. A double door leads into the building.
>>

A creature that falls off the balcony can catch the railing with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls to the ground 15 feet below, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

***Guards.*** Two guards are posted here. During shift changes, guards access the balcony via the rope ladder and never enter area T13. A guard who notices suspicious activity below uses an action to pull up the rope ladder.

***Locked Door.*** The double door to area T13 is locked. The balcony guards have a key but use it only if they detect intruders inside.

***Vidorant.*** If Vidorant teleports to the vault (see the "Vidorant Arrives" section later in the adventure), she arrives on the balcony, as the interior of the vault is warded against teleportation magic.

#### T13: Vidorant's Quarters

>>The north half of these luxurious living quarters holds a study area with a fine desk and two beautiful paintings of night festivals. A delicate curtain opening to the south reveals a sleeping area. The bed is piled high with sumptuous linens. This area also holds a sturdy wooden wardrobe and a privy.
>>

Guards don't patrol this room, the eastern door of which is unlocked. Though Vidorant lives in a mansion nearby, she sometimes sleeps here after working late in her vault. Her bedroom includes a wardrobe with several changes of clothes, which could be useful if a character wants to fashion a disguise.

***Desk.*** Vidorant's desk drawer is locked. As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to unlock it, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The desk contains many documents. A character who examines them for 1 minute and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds the plans for Vidorant's next heist, targeting a noble with close ties to Goldenbeard.

***Locked Door.*** The door to area T12 is locked but easily unlocked from inside this room.

***Treasure.*** The two paintings of night festivals are worth 250 gp each.

#### T14: Strong Room

>>This room contains four large metal cabinets.
>>

Guards don't patrol this unlocked room.

***Secret Passage.*** Any character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 18 or higher notices that the hallway between areas T14 and T15 doesn't extend as far north as this room does. A character who searches the northeast corner of the room can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, finding a secret door on a success. Beyond it is a passage ending at another secret door. No ability check is required to spot the door from inside the passage. Characters can use this route to enter area T15 and avoid the trap there.

***Trapped Cabinets.*** All four cabinets in this room are locked and trapped. A character who examines the cabinets for 1 minute can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, finding all four traps on a success. Inside each cabinet is a delicate glass vial containing poison gas. The vial breaks if the cabinet is opened by any means other than using the proper key (which is in Vidorant's possession). A character can use thieves' tools to try to disarm one of these traps, doing so with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check. Failing the check by 5 or more triggers the trap.

A character can use thieves' tools to try to unlock a cabinet, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. However, if the trap hasn't been disarmed, the cabinet releases its poison gas. The gas from one vial is enough to fill the room but dissipates quickly. Each creature in the room when the gas is released must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage.

***Treasure.*** Each cabinet holds 1,000 gp.

#### T15: Inner Vault

This room's main door, situated in the middle of the west wall, is locked (DC 18 to open) and made of metal.

***Trap.*** Just behind the door, inside the room, is an electrically charged metal wire resembling a trip wire. When the door opens, it makes contact with the wire. Any creature touching the door takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage from the shock. The wire then snaps, disabling the trap. The trap is easy to disarm from inside the room (no check required), but it can't be disarmed from outside the room.

Characters can avoid the trap by entering the room through a secret door in the northwest corner (see area T14).

>>This room has marble flooring and ivory-colored wallpaper with silver accents. The room contains seven glass cases on pedestals, each enclosing a small item.
>>

***Display Cases.*** On each case, a notecard written in elegant handwriting bears the item's name and a brief description:

- **Jeweled Human Skull** The card reads, "Unclear if genuine skull or replica. Found in ancient tomb." This skull is coated with gold. Large diamonds are mounted in its eye sockets, and small rubies drip down its cheekbones like bloody tears. (The skull is worth 2,000 gp.)
- **Lost Map of Tishanos** The card reads, "Reportedly from Pirate Queen Shrixette Laderie. No other records of Tishanos found. Must mount expedition." This weathered map details an island that lies about a hundred miles from an unidentified coastline. (The map has no intrinsic monetary value but could lead to adventure.)
- **Royal Scepter** The card reads, "Used in the coronation of Queen Calinia. Possible gift from elven court." This golden scepter is intricately engraved and set with diamonds and sapphires. (The scepter is worth 2,000 gp.)
- **Ruby Diadem of Erlynn Blessedore** The card reads, "Owned by Queen Erlynn Blessedore, ancestor of Samphith." Each spire of the diadem is studded with rubies. (The diadem is worth 2,000 gp.)
- **Silvered Dagger** The card reads, "Used to assassinate Prince Angryn Sheselitte. Nonmagical." This dagger is unremarkable, though high quality. (The dagger is worth 1,000 gp as a collector's item.)
- **Snowy's Collar** The card reads, "Owned by legendary fortune-teller Gratchia Gartirio. Dog reportedly told the future." This fine silk collar, sized for a small dog, has a diamond-encrusted tag reading "Snowy." (The collar is worth 1,000 gp.)
- **Thesis of Mortinsor** The card reads, "Owned by Mortinsor, the famous necromancer. Possibly contains secrets of longevity, but difficult to decipher." This oversized tome is full of esoteric, archaic text that would require extensive research to decipher. A character who spends 12 weeks studying it and succeeds on a DC 22 Intelligence (Arcana) check finds a page that serves as a *spell scroll* of *sequester*. (The thesis is worth 500 gp.)

Each item is protected by two separate abjuration runes that trigger *alarm* spells. The first rune is on the display case, and it sounds an audible alarm when that display case is opened (see "Caught in the Act"). The second rune is on the item itself, and it silently alerts Vidorant when that item is removed from the room (see "Vidorant Arrives" below).

A character who examines the various treasures and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the first set of runes on all the display cases. A character who succeeds on this check by 5 or more also notices the second set of runes on the items themselves.

A character can disable a particular rune (and its linked *alarm* spell) with the *dispel magic* spell or a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A character who fails the check by 5 or more triggers the alarm. The first time a character successfully disables one of these runes, the DC to do so on the others decreases to 13. Alternatively, a character can slip an item out of its case without triggering the display case alarm by succeeding on a DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failed check, the audible alarm activates (see "Caught in the Act").

## Vidorant Arrives

Once the characters obtain the diadem, they must escape the vault to complete the heist.

If Vidorant (chaotic neutral, elf **assassin**) is alerted to the theft by an alarm in her inner vault (area T15), she uses a custom-made ring that functions as a *helm of teleportation* (to which only she can attune) to teleport to the balcony 5 rounds after the alarm is triggered. She heads toward the characters while calling loudly for the guards. The balcony guards follow her, and all other guards in the vault go on high alert (see "Caught in the Act").

### Vidorant's Offer

If Vidorant intercepts the characters, she makes a surprising offer:

>>An elf woman with sleek black hair approaches you with a smile. "You've done well. Not just any thieves could make it to my personal vault. I congratulate you. I'm sure this means the Silver Fingers placed a bounty on that ruby diadem—Goldenbeard's been furious about that thing for years. But if you'll allow me a moment, perhaps I can make you a better offer?"
>>

If the characters refuse to hear her deal, Vidorant attacks them. If they agree to listen to her deal, she continues speaking:

![](img/adventure/KftGV/065-08-005.nixylanna-vidorant.webp)

>>"I could try to dispatch you—and I might succeed—but more thieves will keep trying to interfere with my business. Instead, what if you went back and told everyone my vault was impenetrable and I thoroughly defeated you? It would head off a lot of trouble. In exchange, I'll give you this." She pulls a delicate ring from her finger. "It's worth more to you than the diadem—after all, it's part of how I've become such a famous thief. Goldenbeard is planning to take the diadem for himself, right? He's still mad about our heist all those years ago. But this ring you can keep. Tell whatever story you like about where you got it, as long as it's not from me. You get rich, I look strong, and no one's the wiser."
>>

The ring is a *ring of evasion*. If the characters agree to Vidorant's terms or negotiate her into a reasonable compromise, she upholds her part of the deal.

If Vidorant knows the characters have taken items of significant value from her vault, she suggests an even better deal: if they return the most valuable items they stole, she'll also give them her *gloves of thievery*, which she's currently wearing invisibly on her hands.

If all parties agree, she hands over the ring (and possibly the gloves) in exchange for the diadem, then escorts the characters outside, loudly bragging about their defeat and threatening violence if she ever sees them again.

## Conclusion

If the characters return the diadem to Goldenbeard, he offers them lifetime membership in the Silver Fingers Society. He also promises them a personal favor they can redeem next time they need help with a situation. If the party prefers a cash reward instead, he happily obliges and still promises a favor.

If the characters took Vidorant's deal or decided to keep the diadem for themselves, they must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma (Deception) check to convince Goldenbeard they were unable to retrieve the diadem. If Goldenbeard realizes they're lying to him, he grows very serious. He doesn't attack the party himself; instead, he uses the Silver Fingers Society to steal back the diadem or otherwise make the characters' lives difficult.

If the characters fool him or were simply unable to recover the diadem, Goldenbeard is disappointed, but he reassures the characters there will be other opportunities to work together in the future.

### Blackmailing Goldenbeard

If the characters found the blackmail material regarding Goldenbeard in Vidorant's safe and they bring it up with him, his face goes blank and he responds:

>>"I see. She couldn't reveal that without implicating herself, but you have no such hesitation. I have no comment on its truth—but it would be messy if revealed. I am willing to buy this from you."
>>

He offers the characters 1,000 gp for the original copy of Vidorant's blackmail material. A character who succeeds on a DC 17 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check convinces him to increase his payment to 2,000 gp.

### For the Golden Vault

If the characters are working for the Golden Vault and they return the diadem to Goldenbeard, the organization offers the characters a rare magic item of their choice (subject to your approval) as payment. The item is delivered to the characters the next day.
