# Shard of the Accursed

*An Adventure for 8th-Level Characters*

A mysterious shard made of obsidian places a curse on everyone who bears it. When the shard comes into the characters' possession, they must break its curse by returning the shard to the ancient tomb it came from. But a dangerous crime syndicate controls the tomb and its riches, and the criminals won't take kindly to the characters' intrusion.

This adventure isn't a typical heist; rather, it's a reverse heist. Instead of retrieving a valuable item, the characters are tasked with returning one to its proper place.

## Adventure Background

![](img/adventure/KftGV/067-09-002.ch9-key.webp)

Long ago, a giant named Xeluan was attacked by his ruthless kin and left to die. After a group of heroes found him and nursed him back to health, the grateful giant pledged his life in their service. Xeluan and his heroic friends went on to perform great deeds.

When earthquakes and volcanic eruptions threatened to destroy the heroes' homeland, Xeluan carved a citadel into a mountainside, creating a refuge for the heroes and their people. The giant harnessed earth magic to create a protective ward around the settlement, but the devastation proved unstoppable. As the mountain crumbled and volcanic rifts threatened to engulf those he loved, Xeluan lifted the sanctuary above his shoulders and made a final, desperate sacrifice. He wove his life energy into the magic protecting the citadel, allowing it to withstand the onslaught. In doing so, Xeluan sacrificed his life to save thousands.

After the calamity, the heroes looked for the giant amid the changed landscape. They found his petrified body buried beneath the citadel, still holding it aloft. When all efforts to restore him failed, the heroes built a mausoleum around Xeluan's body to honor his sacrifice. The heroes lived prosperous lives, and afterward, their bodies were interred in Xeluan's tomb. When the last hero died, the tomb was sealed, and so it remained for centuries. Xeluan's sacrifice was lost to legend, and the heroes were remembered only as fables. As the citadel eroded to ruins, the tomb below it was all but forgotten.

About a century ago, a group of explorers found the ruins of the citadel, its protective wards still intact. Around the citadel, these explorers founded the settlement of Oztocan. The settlement grew into a thriving hub of commerce. Today, that prosperity is threatened by the machinations of a criminal organization known as the Onyx Scar. The criminals have unearthed Xeluan's tomb and are mining the giant's petrified corpse, selling his remains at local markets. Additionally, their delving has weakened the citadel's wards, causing earthquakes to plague the region.

## The Accursed Shard

This adventure revolves around an obsidian shard imbued with powerful magic. In the course of the adventure, the characters discover that the shard is a fragment of Xeluan's petrified heart. Only by using the shard to mend Xeluan's broken heart can they stop the earthquakes that rock Oztocan.

### Shard Rumors

Some of this adventure's impact relies on the misunderstood nature of the *shard of Xeluan*. No one remembers Xeluan's sacrifice or knows the shard is a fragment of his petrified heart. Moreover, the shard has gained an undeservedly sinister reputation because of rumors surrounding it.

Use the Shard Rumors table to inspire stories the characters might hear about the item's history. Whether a rumor is true or false is left to your judgment.

### Shard Description

See the *shard of Xeluan* entry. Characters don't become aware of the shard's curse until it comes into play.

## Adventure Hooks

Either the Golden Vault delivers the *shard of Xeluan* to the characters at the start of the adventure (see "Using the Golden Vault" below), or the characters come to possess the shard from one of the following individuals:

- **Jamishka Zaril** Oztocan is an important outpost for a flourishing trade organization called the Couatl Company. Its owner, Jamishka (lawful good, elf **veteran**), recently acquired the shard and has since learned that it must be returned to the tomb from which it was taken to stop the earthquakes that threaten Oztocan. Jamishka hires the characters to bring the shard to Leandro Sedhar, a playwright in Oztocan who can help them, and promises them a suit of *elven chain* (or some other rare magic item of your choice) as payment for stopping the earthquakes.
- **Yana Resendes** A kindly scholar named Yana (neutral good, hobgoblin **mage**) recently acquired the shard at a market. Her investigations revealed the shard comes from Oztocan, which is beset by earthquakes. In Yana's opinion, returning the cursed shard to the place from which it was taken is the best way to stop the earthquakes. If the characters vow to complete this quest, Yana gives them a *necklace of prayer beads* (or some other rare magic item of your choice) as a token of her thanks and instructs them to bring the shard to Leandro Sedhar, a playwright in Oztocan who can help them.

## Using the Golden Vault

If you're using the Golden Vault as a patron, a golden key is delivered to the characters in whatever manner you deem fit. If the characters don't already have the *shard of Xeluan* in their possession, the golden key is tied to the shard, and both objects are delivered in a stoppered lead tube.

When the golden key is used to open the music box, the lid pops open and a soothing voice says the following:

>>"Greetings, operatives. Earthquakes threaten the town of Oztocan, and the Golden Vault believes the enclosed shard is the heart of the problem.
>>
>>"This shard was taken from the tomb of a giant named Xeluan. A criminal organization called the Onyx Scar has been plundering Xeluan's tomb and selling off its treasures. The shard passed through many hands before the Golden Vault acquired it. Whoever attunes to the shard gains great strength and magical power but also suffers misfortune due to a curse.
>>
>>"This quest, should you choose to undertake it, requires you travel to Oztocan with the shard, descend into Xeluan's tomb, and return the shard to its rightful place. Once you reach Oztocan, contact a playwright named Leandro Sedhar. He knows vital information about Oztocan's history and can help you reach the tomb. Good luck, operatives."
>>

Closing the music box causes the golden key to vanish. The *shard of Xeluan* and the lead tube remain.

## What Really Happened

Two decades ago, an elf archivist named Rilago found crumbling journals and architectural plans in his family's ancestral library that mentioned a tomb beneath Oztocan. The town's mayor refused to allow Rilago to mount an excavation, but the mayor's daughter, Aminta, overheard their conversation and became obsessed with finding the tomb.

Years later, the mayor passed away and his son, Tavio, was elected to replace him. Aminta, who had become involved with the Onyx Scar crime syndicate, persuaded Rilago to join her search for the tomb and convinced Tavio to overlook their endeavor. Aminta and Rilago found the tomb and Xeluan's petrified remains, but no treasure. Disappointed, they tried to profit by shattering the giant's body, only to find it indestructible.

One day, as Rilago climbed on the scaffolding surrounding Xeluan, he punched the giant's stone chest in frustration. It unexpectedly cracked open, revealing a heart of obsidian. A single shard broke off from the heart, impaling and killing Rilago.

Unbeknownst to everyone involved, Rilago was descended from one of the ancient heroes Xeluan died to protect. One of Rilago's rings was a family heirloom from that ancestor. When he punched the giant with that ring, he literally and symbolically broke Xeluan's heart, weakening the magic that protects the giant's corpse.

The formerly indestructible giant began to deteriorate, allowing Aminta to collect broken-off pieces of Xeluan's body. This material, called "oztocanite," can be worked into precious gemstones or used to empower spells (see area X4). The sale of oztocanite has become a profitable enterprise for Aminta and has increased her status in the Onyx Scar.

## Town of Oztocan

Perched on a flat between two large mountains, the town of Oztocan is surrounded by deep canyons. The town shares the warm and dry climate of the region, which has sparse vegetation and rivers that run dry most of the year.

Magic radiating from Xeluan's tomb protects the town and the surrounding region from monster attacks and destructive natural occurrences, but the wards have weakened since Xeluan's heart cracked. Earthquakes that would normally be suppressed by the magic are now being felt, raising concerns that Oztocan is no longer safe.

### Arrival in Oztocan

As the characters approach the town, read the following:

>>Built on a large flat between two rocky mountains, the town of Oztocan is cradled by the crescent-shaped ruins of a massive stone citadel. Three guards stand at the point where the dusty road meets the town.
>>

The three **guards** eye the characters warily, but they don't stop or interfere with the party in any way. If the characters ask about Leandro Sedhar, a guard directs them to a local inn called the Giant's Skull, where Leandro is known to spend much of his time.

#### Tremor

As soon as the characters enter the town, whoever is carrying the *shard of Xeluan* feels it drawn downward, as if attracted to something underground. Simultaneously, a small tremor ripples through the town, shaking dust from buildings but otherwise causing no damage. The locals appear accustomed to the quake and continue their activities unfazed.

### Leandro Sedhar

Asking for Leandro around town leads the characters to the Giant's Skull, a welcoming inn made of wood and adobe. Leandro has been staying here for the past few weeks.

Leandro (chaotic good **noble**) is a tabaxi—a Humanoid with feline features, including claws and a tail. He's short and stout, with lush, sand-colored fur and thin whiskers. Tiny square glasses frame his amber eyes. He was born in a distant land but has been traveling abroad for nearly twenty years. He arrived in Oztocan a few months ago and is working on a play inspired by the town's local legends. As a playwright, he often draws inspiration from history.

#### What Leandro Knows

Leandro welcomes the characters and takes an interest in the *shard of Xeluan* if they show it to him. He asks to see it more closely but refuses to touch it.

In the course of a conversation, Leandro shares the following information with the characters:

- **Earthquakes** "Oztocan hasn't felt earthquakes in years, but quakes have become common in recent weeks. No damage has been done yet, but the quakes are getting worse. It's only a matter of time before someone gets hurt."
- **Rilago** "Years ago, an elf archivist named Rilago claimed to have proof of a giant's tomb beneath Oztocan. Rilago tried to mount a full-scale excavation, but the mayor wouldn't allow it. Rilago stayed in Oztocan until his disappearance a few weeks ago—around the time the earthquakes began."
- **Tavio** "I recently spoke to the Tavio Solana, the mayor. He grew uncomfortable when I mentioned Rilago. It was Tavio's father, the previous mayor, who refused to allow the excavation of Xeluan's tomb. I don't believe Tavio had anything to do with Rilago's disappearance, but I can't help but think Tavio knows something about it."
- **Aminta** "Tavio's sister, Aminta, commands the town guard. Rumor has it she was involved with Rilago romantically."

#### Leandro's Secret

Leandro knows that Aminta is a member of the Onyx Scar, a criminal syndicate with operatives scattered throughout Oztocan. Leandro is fond of Tavio, the mayor, and doesn't want him to suffer blame for Oztocan's troubles or Aminta's criminal pursuits, so he keeps these facts to himself.

Leandro recently confronted Tavio, who admitted he has been covering up Aminta's criminal activities and her excavation of Xeluan's tomb. Guilt-ridden over the earthquakes, Tavio stole a map of Xeluan's tomb from Aminta's quarters and gave it to Leandro for safekeeping.

#### Leandro's Map

If the characters seem interested in stopping the earthquakes and solving the mystery of Rilago's disappearance, Leandro shows them the map Tavio gave him. (Give the players a copy of *map 9.1*.) The map is pieced together from several torn scraps and shows most of Xeluan's tomb, minus locations that hadn't been uncovered at the time the map was drawn. Leandro informs the characters that the handwriting on the map is Rilago's.

If the characters draw Leandro's attention to the words "Heroes Rest Here" on the map's upper level, Leandro shares an Oztocan fable about a band of heroes who defended their homeland with the help of a giant. When the giant died, the heroes honored their mighty companion by building a tomb around his petrified body. Leandro doesn't know what became of the heroes, nor does history remember their names, but the giant's name was Xeluan.

> ##### Placing Oztocan
>
>Oztocan is situated amid the One Flint Sierras mountain range south of San Citlán, an industrial city-state that first appeared in the adventure anthology *Journeys through the Radiant Citadel*. If your campaign takes place elsewhere in the D&D multiverse, you can insert Oztocan into any mountainous location.
>

### Casa Solana

Tavio and Aminta Solana are the children of the town's previous mayor, the late Nadario Solana. Oztocan has no aristocracy, but the Solana family is the next closest thing.

If the characters want to question Tavio Solana, Leandro informs them the mayor lives in a large two-story house with his sister. Well-tended gardens surround the house, which has six guards (**veterans**). Two guards stand outside the front entrance, two stand outside the back entrance, and two are inside the house within earshot of the mayor.

#### Tavio Solana

Tavio Solana (neutral, human **noble**) is the amiable and easily manipulated mayor of Oztocan. In his forties, Tavio has brown skin and sports short black hair, a scruffy beard, and simple clothes. Although he is smart, he has an aversion to conflict and is filled with self-doubt.

When the characters first arrive at the Solana residence, Aminta is not present, but Tavio is in the gardens.

- **Approaching the Mayor** If the characters approach Tavio and politely request his help, he hesitates before telling them that he wants his sister to stop despoiling the tomb, as he believes her actions endanger the town. If the characters press him for information, Tavio laments that most of the town guard is under the sway of the Onyx Scar, except for two guards who have been with his family for years. Tavio then reveals the following information in the course of a whispered conversation:
- **Aminta's Whereabouts** "It grieves me to say that my sister is obsessed with plundering the tomb under Oztocan. Of late, she talks of nothing else. She doesn't trust anyone, which is why she is overseeing the operation personally."
- **Cause of the Earthquakes** "Unearthing the tomb has angered the gods, who send earthquakes as warnings. If we don't heed these warnings, Oztocan will be destroyed."
- **Rilago's Fate** "Rilago? He was so keen to explore the tomb—he and my sister, both. Aminta told me a trap killed him—an obsidian splinter through the heart. Poor man."
- **Workers Needed** "Aminta needs more workers to help remove precious stones from the tomb. I'm supposed to help her find workers who know how to keep their mouths shut."
- **Secret Entrance** "Workers are led to and from the tomb through a guarded passage in the ruined citadel around which the town is built."

If the characters show Tavio the *shard of Xeluan*, he tells them the following:

>>"That's the splinter that killed Rilago! Aminta showed it to me after pulling it from his body. She told me it's from the heart of a giant statue. How did you come to acquire it?"
>>

Regardless of what the characters tell him, Tavio urges them to return the shard to its proper place in the tomb. He also asks them to beware his sister, whose allegiance to the Onyx Scar is absolute.

### Infiltration Plans

The characters have several options for infiltrating the tomb.

#### Infiltrating as Workers

Tavio believes the characters could most easily infiltrate Aminta's operation by posing as workers, but he warns they'll be searched on the way in. His two trustworthy guards can hide the characters' gear in a chest near the workers' quarters. If the characters agree to this, Tavio concocts an excuse to visit Aminta at the tomb. He and his guards leave the party's equipment in area X9.

Tavio directs the characters to a spot near the citadel where workers wait to be escorted to the tomb (see "Ruined Citadel").

#### Rilago's Notes

Other than the citadel's main entrance (on the lower level of map 9.1), Rilago's notes point to three other possible means of entry: two ventilation shafts exiting to the hills outside Oztocan (see "Ventilation Shafts") and a fountain connected to a nearby grotto (see "Ironbed Grotto").

![Map 9.1: Players' Map](img/adventure/KftGV/069-09-004.players-map.webp)

### Reaching the Tomb

The following locations provide different ways to access Xeluan's tomb.

#### Ruined Citadel

Oztocan's most prominent landmark is the ruined citadel around which the town was built. A recently excavated tunnel leads to Xeluan's tomb and is guarded at all times, as described below:

>>Ten members of the town guard stand watch atop giant blocks of stone that were once part of a great citadel, now a tumbled-down ruin. A tunnel has been opened at the base of the ruined citadel. Crude, torchlit steps descend into the earth.
>>

The ten **veterans** guarding the tunnel entrance are loyal to Aminta and attack anyone who tries to enter the tunnel without an escort. If the characters come here in the guise of workers, five of the guards lead them to area X1 at the start of the next shift change, which occurs whenever you deem appropriate.

#### Ventilation Shafts

Ventilation shafts connect Xeluan's tomb to two caves: one to the east, the other to the west. Oztocan's residents are familiar with the caves but avoid them because they're hard to reach.

The characters must climb or fly 200 feet to reach either cave, which is situated in the middle of a hillside escarpment. Any such climb requires pitons, rope, and a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check for every 100 feet climbed. On a failed check, a character falls 50 feet before they're caught by their climbing rope, taking 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

Each cave is empty except for a ventilation shaft in its back wall. Both shafts are 20 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and made of smooth limestone. The east ventilation shaft leads to a corridor between areas X6 and X7. The west ventilation shaft leads to a corridor between areas X12 and X13.

Each ventilation shaft ends at a grate made of corroded, vertical iron bars, which the characters must bypass to enter the corridor beyond. As an action, a character can try to bend or break the rusty bars, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check and creating an opening big enough for Medium or smaller creatures to pass through.

#### Ironbed Grotto

Rilago's map mentions Ironbed Grotto—a name Leandro and Tavio recognize as a cavern network east of town. Near Ironbed Grotto's easily found entrance, an underground river winds through the caverns, eventually feeding the fountain in area X6. The cave network is devoid of town guards, but monsters might dwell here at your discretion.

Once the characters near the fountain, the caverns narrow into a small underwater channel the characters must swim through, as detailed in area X6. If the characters use this route, they enter the tomb soaking wet.

## Xeluan's Tomb

Xeluan's brave companions built a tomb around the giant's remains so everyone who wanted to honor him could do so. One of these heroes—an elf monk named Itze—founded the Order of Xeluan, a sect of monks dedicated to preserving the tomb.

As the years passed, the tomb came to house the remains of Itze's other companions, who wished to join Xeluan in eternal rest. Finally, only Itze remained. In the final years of her life, she prepared to be buried with her companions. When Itze died, her remains were placed in the tomb, and the Order of Xeluan sealed the tomb and disbanded.

### Tomb Features

Xeluan's tomb has the following features:

- **Ceilings** Ceilings are 15 feet high, with the exception of the 40-foot-high Great Chamber (area X4).
- **Doors** Unless otherwise specified, doors are made of iron-reinforced wood and are kept locked, requiring a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves' tools or DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check to open. Guards carry keys to each door on their level unless otherwise noted.
- **Light** Areas X2, X3, X4, and X21 are brightly lit by torches imbued with *continual flame* spells. The rest of the tomb is dark. Members of the Onyx Scar use oil lamps to light their surroundings. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.
- **Walls and Floors** The tomb is carved from limestone. The walls on the upper level are engraved with scenes depicting Xeluan's life, though they've eroded considerably after years of neglect.

### Tomb Locations

The following locations in Xeluan's tomb are keyed to map 9.2.

![Map 9.2: DM's Map](img/adventure/KftGV/070-map-9.02-dms-map.webp)![Player Version](img/adventure/KftGV/071-map-9.02-dms-map-player.webp)
#### X1: Main Entrance

A 200-foot-long, excavated tunnel connects the citadel ruins to a natural cavern under Oztocan. Torches light the tunnel at 10-foot intervals. When the characters reach the cavern, read the following:

>>Dampness hangs in the air, and fungus clings to the walls of this limestone cavern. At the far end, worn steps lead up to a pair of massive doors. Each door is made of black iron and shaped like half of a giant face, cast with an expression of deep pain.
>>

If the characters arrive here under the pretext of pretending to be workers, their armed escort (five **veterans**) leads them through the iron doors into area X2.

***Iron Doors.*** The doors are held shut by two iron bars that can be removed only by creatures in area X2. If the party approaches the doors with an armed escort, one of the guards knocks on the doors six times, which signals the guards in area X2 to lift the bars and open the doors. The guards in area X2 won't open the doors unless they hear a sequence of six knocks—no more, no less. The doors have AC 17, 80 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

The noise of breaking down the doors can be heard by all creatures on the tomb's lower level. These creatures remain in their respective locations but are alert for the next hour, during which time they can't be surprised.

#### X2: Vestibule

The following boxed text assumes the characters enter from the south. If they enter from the north, they can't see the carvings on the granite slab, the furniture behind it, or the guards:

>>Torches mounted to four pillars light this ancient room. In the center of the room, a table and several chairs are situated in front of a vertical slab of granite measuring ten feet high and thirty feet wide. This slab bears carvings of people carrying offerings to a citadel nestled between two mountains.
>>
>>Four battle-ready members of the town guard stand next to the pillars.
>>

This antechamber once welcomed pilgrims wishing to pay their respects to Xeluan, but the Onyx Scar has converted it into a guard post. The guards stationed here are four **veterans**.

If the characters are pretending to be workers, the guards search them for concealed armor and weapons before leading them to area X4. A character can try to smuggle a light weapon or smaller object past the guards. Doing so requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If the check fails, the guards spot the prohibited item and try to confiscate it; the character must either talk their way out of trouble with a successful DC 18 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check or be attacked.

***Barred Door.*** Two iron bars seal the double door to the south. Removing an iron bar takes an action.

#### X3: Arrow Slit Hallway

>>A narrow hallway lined with arrow slits stretches north and south, opening into brightly lit chambers at each end.
>>

This area once contained shrines to various gods, but the Onyx Scar renovated it, creating a hallway with arrow slits on both sides.

***Arrow Slits.*** Four Onyx Scar **thugs** stand behind the western arrow slits, ready to shoot their crossbows at intruders who traverse the hallway without an Onyx Scar escort. The arrow slits give the thugs three-quarters cover.

No guards are stationed behind the eastern arrow slits.

![The statue of a giant braces the ceiling in Xeluan's Tomb](img/adventure/KftGV/072-09-005.statue-of-giants-braces.webp)

#### X4: Great Chamber

>>Encircling this domed chamber is a fifteen-foot-high mezzanine supported by four limestone pillars. In the room's center, a thirty-foot-tall statue made of lustrous black rock reflects the torchlight. The statue depicts a giant, his face frozen in determination and his arms bracing the ceiling. A hole in the statue's chest exposes an obsidian heart with glittering veins of silver and gold.
>>
>>Scaffolding around the statue provides easy access to the mezzanine. Standing on and around the scaffolding are several workers. Some are using pickaxes to chip away at the statue, while others are gathering chunks of the statue into crates.
>>
>>Passages here lead northwest, northeast, and south.
>>

***Tremor.*** The first time the characters bring the *shard of Xeluan* into this room or onto the mezzanine (area X18), the ground shakes and rubble falls from the ceiling. Each creature in these areas must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from falling debris.

***Workers.*** Roll 1d6 + 3 to determine how many workers (**commoners**) are here when the characters arrive. One of the workers acts as an overseer. If the characters are pretending to be workers, the overseer gives them tasks as the other workers retire to area X12 for some much-needed rest.

The Onyx Scar pays the workers to keep their mouths shut. Any character who questions the workers can pry the following information from them with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check:

- **Aminta** Aminta was last seen on the upper level.
- **Edino's Research** An elf mage named Edino is conducting experiments on the giant's remains. Edino's study (area X10) lies west of here.
- **Trouble to the East** The Onyx Scar has sealed off the area to the east due to a "fungal infestation." That area contains a garden, a fountain, and a secret exit from the tomb. (The workers overheard two members of the Onyx Scar talking about area X6 but don't know any more details.)

***Raw Oztocanite.*** Chunks of oztocanite (the giant's magic-imbued remains) are gathered into crates around the room. A fist-sized chunk of oztocanite can be used as a spellcasting focus that grants a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. However, if its wielder rolls a 1 on a spell attack roll while using it as a focus, the chunk shatters and the creature takes 10 (3d6) thunder damage.

***Giant's Heart.*** The first character to inspect Xeluan's body notices a large sliver is missing from his heart—the *shard of Xeluan* would easily fit into it. However, the characters can't mend Xeluan's heart without the help of Rilago's ghost in area X22.

If the characters attempt to place the *shard of Xeluan* in the heart without Rilago, the shard falls out again and nothing happens. A character who observes this and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes a mystical force shattered the giant's heart and that this same force might be able to mend it.

#### X5: Barricaded Corridor

The Onyx Scar barricaded this corridor after the myconids in area X6 began to attack anyone who got close to them. The hall contains two barricades, each one a floor-to-ceiling stack of wooden logs. A single character can remove a barricade in 30 minutes. Multiple characters working together can reduce this time proportionately.

#### X6: Forgotten Garden

>>A haze of spores fills this large room, three corners of which contain walled-in shrines with steps leading up to them. Tangled mushrooms and roots have extended beyond a central garden to cover every visible surface.
>>
>>Rising from the garden is a staircase that connects to a wooden trapdoor in the ceiling. A burbling fountain protrudes from the wall east of the garden.
>>
>>A narrow hallway leads north, and from the southeast corner of the room, a wider hallway leads south.
>>

The room is lightly obscured by clouds of spores. The Order of Xeluan used to harvest mushrooms from the garden, which is now the home of two **myconid sovereigns**, four **myconid adults**, and a **shambling mound**. These creatures lurk amid the garden's vegetation. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher see the creatures.

A recent effort by the Onyx Scar to clear the room for storage led to hostilities with the resident Plant creatures. The myconids and the shambling mound attack anyone who approaches the garden or emerges from the fountain (see "Fountain" below). If one or more myconids are killed, the surviving myconids use their Rapport Spores to signal their surrender. The shambling mound, however, fights until destroyed.

***Fountain.*** A narrow underground river feeds the fountain and connects to the caverns of Ironbed Grotto (see "Reaching the Tomb"). Characters who enter the tomb via Ironbed Grotto emerge from the fountain's waterspout, which has an opening big enough for Medium or smaller creatures to crawl through.

***Shrines.*** The shrines in the northwest, northeast, and southwest corners of the room contain statues representing gods of nature and protection.

***South Corridor.*** The south corridor leads to area X7. Halfway down the east-to-west section of the corridor, a rusty iron grate in the south wall blocks access to a ventilation shaft (see "Reaching the Tomb").

***Stairs.*** The stairs in the garden ascend to a trapdoor that Edino (see area X10) has sealed with an *arcane lock* spell. As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to bypass the magical lock, doing so with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check, or the character can try to force open the trapdoor, doing so with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens the trapdoor, which swings upward into area X21.

#### X7: Ruined Shrines

>>Crumbling altars, ruined statues, and idols of forgotten gods litter the floor of this small chamber.
>>

This chamber once housed shrines to the gods of ancient local religions, but they have all been smashed and ruined.

***Secret Door.*** Any character who examines the west wall and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers a secret door in the middle of it. A character with the Stonecunning trait or proficiency with mason's tools has advantage on this check. The stone door is unlocked and can be pushed aside to access the eastern section of area X3.

#### X8: Living Quarters

>>This area of the tomb has thick timber walls lined with wooden doors. The stone floor is strewn with dirt and covered with fresh bootprints.
>>

Long ago, this area served as living quarters for the monks of the Order of Xeluan. Now it has been overtaken by the Onyx Scar for the same purpose.

***X8a. North Quarters.*** Five Onyx Scar **thugs** sleep in these rooms, one per room. Each room contains a cot with an oil lamp hanging above it.

***X8b. South Quarters.*** Each of these rooms contains a cot with an oil lamp hanging above it. All five rooms are currently unoccupied.

#### X9: Storage

>>This room contains weapon racks, stacks of wooden crates, and doors leading to the north and east. In the center of the room, a staircase rises to the upper level.
>>

If the characters were brought in as workers, Tavio's personal guards left a wooden chest in this area that contains any equipment the characters arranged for Tavio to smuggle in.

***Stairs.*** The stairs ascend to area X14.

***Warded Door.*** The door to area X10 is warded by an *alarm* spell that mentally alerts Edino if anyone touches it.

#### X10: Edino's Study

>>A hulking figure made of clay stands on the other side of the door, its thick arms ending in balled fists, its head a featureless lump. Behind it is a room containing two bookshelves, a bed, a table, and a desk.
>>

The hulking figure is a **clay golem** that doesn't wait for characters to enter the room before attacking them. It fights until destroyed.

A lawful evil, elf **mage** named Edino lurks in the room. Edino is the Onyx Scar's resident spellcaster and has cast *greater invisibility* on himself. If the characters defeat the golem, Edino hides until he can sneak to area X19 and alert Aminta.

***Edino's Experiments.*** Edino experiments with oztocanite in this room. As part of his experiments, Edino has bound the souls of Xeluan's companions (from area X22) to four fist-sized pieces of oztocanite. One of these soul fragments sits on Edino's desk. The other three fragments are in a desk drawer. Any character who examines a fragment and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check senses there's a life force trapped inside it but has no clue how to release it (see area X22).

***Treasure.*** A *spellbook* on the western bookshelf contains the spells Edino has prepared plus *alarm*, *arcane lock*, *detect thoughts*, *dimension door*, and *glyph of warding*. The other books in Edino's collection aren't valuable and cover such topics as geology, gemology, and mining.

#### X11: Mess Hall

Loud voices and laughter can be heard through the door to this room.

>>This room contains three mismatched tables at odd angles, each one littered with food scraps and empty mugs. A makeshift bar has been constructed along the south wall. Four ruffians in leather armor play cards at one table, while two town guards eat at the bar and chat with the dwarf bartender. All eyes turn to you as the door opens.
>>

This area is used as a mess hall for workers and low-ranking Onyx Scar members. Four **thugs** sit at one table, while two **veterans** eat snacks at the bar. As soon as they detect intruders, the thugs and veterans draw their weapons and attack.

Brego, the dwarf bartender (lawful evil **spy**), is a longtime friend of Aminta's and a member of the Onyx Scar. He stands on a small crate to reach the bar's countertop. If a fight erupts, Brego ducks behind the bar and hurls flaming bottles of alcohol at intruders (treat each bottle as a *flask of alchemist's fire*) unless he is stopped. The bar gives Brego three-quarters cover.

#### X12: Worker Rest Area

>>Nearly two dozen bedrolls are scattered across the floor of this dusty stone room. Some of the bedrolls have workers resting on them.
>>

Four workers (**commoners**) rest in the room, along with any workers who left area X4. These workers aren't interested in helping the characters or in making an enemy of the Onyx Scar. If the characters attempt to persuade, deceive, or otherwise recruit the workers to aid them, they can make a relevant DC 15 ability check. On a successful check, the workers won't endanger themselves, but they might share helpful intelligence or agree to stay out of the party's way.

***Southeast Corridor.*** The southeast corridor leads to area X13. A little more than halfway down the corridor, a rusty iron grate in the south wall blocks access to a ventilation shaft (see "Reaching the Tomb").

#### X13: Reconstructed Shrine

>>This room contains four dilapidated altars—two against the north wall and two against the south wall.
>>

Unlike the tomb's other shrines, which the Onyx Scar destroyed, the shrines in this room were repurposed so laborers could worship their gods and feel at peace while working underground.

***Altar Deities.*** The deities represented on the altars are left to your judgment. Gods of work, industry, protection, and luck are particularly appropriate. If you're setting this adventure in the San Citlán region, La Catrina is the patron deity. She is a jovial death goddess represented as a skeleton dressed in expensive finery.

***Secret Door.*** Any character who examines the east wall and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check discovers a secret door in the middle of it. A character with the Stonecunning trait or proficiency with mason's tools has advantage on this check. The stone door is unlocked and can be pushed aside to access the western section of area X3. If the guards in that area haven't been dealt with already, they attack the characters on sight.

#### X14: History Room

>>The stone walls of this circular room are engraved with murals depicting a giant at various stages of his life. A hallway leads east, and in the center of the room, stairs descend to the lower level.
>>

The murals in this room depict Xeluan's legend (see the "Adventure Background" section). If the characters already saw Xeluan in area X4, they recognize him in the etchings.

#### X15: Upper West Antechamber

>>Reliefs on this room's walls depict people bowing in gratitude to a smiling giant. Hallways lead east and west, and doors lead north and south. Seated at a table in the northeast corner are two identical human women playing cards.
>>

The women playing cards are two **doppelgangers** that look exactly like Aminta. If they see three or more intruders, the doppelgangers retreat to area X19; otherwise, they stand and fight.

***Door to Area X17.*** Only the real Aminta has a key to area X17. The lock on the door is trapped with a capsule that contains poisonous gas. The capsule can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. A character who opens the door with Aminta's key safely disarms the capsule, as does a character who picks the lock and succeeds on their check by 5 or more. Otherwise, the capsule breaks when the door is opened, releasing a cloud of poisonous gas that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the door. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 2d4 hours. A poisoned creature falls unconscious but wakes up if it takes damage. The cloud disperses a few seconds after the trap triggers.

#### X16: Aminta's Quarters

>>A large, neatly made bed occupies the west half of this room. Hanging from hooks on the walls are several dresses and cloaks, with pairs of boots and sandals placed neatly below them.
>>
>>On the east side of the room, dinnerware is stacked atop a low wooden table, and a fully stocked wine rack stands against the wall.
>>

***Treasure.*** A small coffer under Aminta's bed holds six *zircons* (50 gp each). Characters who search the wine rack find two bottles of exquisite wine (100 gp each) and three bottles of fine wine (10 gp each). The remaining bottles hold common wine.

#### X17: Treasury

>>This room is lit by oil lamps resting atop two narrow tables. Other furnishings include a desk to the west and four wooden chests to the east.
>>

The desk has a single drawer, inside which is a leather-bound ledger detailing how much money the Onyx Scar has invested in the tomb excavation thus far (nearly 15,000 gp).

***Treasure.*** The four chests are unlocked, and each one contains 2,500 gp. Aminta needs this money to pay workers, bribe town guards, and keep the operation running.

#### X18: Mezzanine

This 15-foot-high mezzanine encircles the Great Chamber (area X4). A walkway made of wooden planks connects the mezzanine with the scaffolding that surrounds the petrified remains of Xeluan.

***Revolving Stone Doors.*** Set into the mezzanine's walls are four heavy stone doors, each of which revolves on a vertical axis. The west and east doors are open, while the north and south doors are shut. These doors aren't locked but grind loudly when opened or closed, attracting the attention of anyone on the upper level or in area X4.

#### X19: War Room

>>The air in this wide room is thick with the smell of dusty tomes. Eight bookshelves stand against the walls. Half of them have collapsed on themselves, while the remaining four bookshelves are packed with crumbling scrolls and books.
>>
>>The room's centerpiece is a long wooden table with an ornate, throne-like chair at one end and smaller chairs along both sides. Seated in the big chair is a human woman clad in leather armor, and she's not alone.
>>

This room was once a library chronicling the history of Xeluan and his heroic companions. The Onyx Scar now uses it for leadership meetings. Aminta Solana (neutral evil, human **assassin**) claims the seat at the head of the table.

Aminta is a human in her late thirties. She has brown skin and long dark hair streaked with gray. She is charming, confident, intelligent, and ruthless. In her pocket is a key to area X17.

Aminta is meeting with two of her distribution generals (**veterans**). Edino (the elf **mage** from area X10) and the two **doppelgangers** from area X15 might be here as well.

If the characters show up pretending to be workers, Aminta yells at them to leave and warns that another intrusion will result in their deaths. If the characters pose an obvious threat, she calls for the doppelgangers in area X15.

Aminta fights until reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, then attempts to flee. Edino behaves similarly. The doppelgangers look and act like the real Aminta, and they do their best to cover Aminta's escape. The two veterans are confident in their combat prowess and fight to the death.

***Revolving Stone Door.*** Set into the west wall is a heavy stone door that revolves on a vertical axis. The door is currently open and grinds loudly when opened or closed. West of the door is an L-shaped hallway leading to area X16.

***Secret Door.*** Characters who examine the bookshelf in the northeast corner see scratch marks on the floor that suggest the bookshelf has been pulled away from the wall more than once. Behind this bookshelf is a secret door that leads to area X21. The secret door can be found by any character who examines the wall behind the bookshelf and succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check. A character with the Stonecunning trait or proficiency with mason's tools has advantage on this check.

The secret door opens to reveal a dusty tunnel with another secret door at the far end. Characters inside the tunnel can find either secret door without needing to make an ability check.

#### X20: Food Storage

>>Containers of dried vegetables, breads, and cheeses are stacked against the walls of this room, and cured meats hang from hooks. A massive stone door to the west stands open, and a wooden door leads north. A gentle breeze causes the dust on the floor to stir.
>>

This room contains enough food and refreshment to supply the Onyx Scar and its workers for weeks. The stone door west of this room is described in area X18. The north door leads to area X21.

An **invisible stalker** floats near the ceiling and is the source of the breeze. If one or more characters disturb the supplies, the stalker attacks them. The stalker doesn't attack if the supplies are left alone.

#### X21: Guest Hall

>>This torchlit room contains a large table with several chairs. The ceiling is hung with black-and-green tapestries. Six doors are spaced evenly along the east and west walls. A seventh door stands in the southwest corner.
>>
>>Against the south wall, set into the floor, is a wooden trapdoor with iron hinges and a pull ring.
>>

This room serves as a guest hall for prominent members of the Onyx Scar and others who come to do business with Aminta. The adjoining guest rooms, which are unlocked, are outfitted with beds and basic amenities.

***Secret Door.*** On the north wall, an unlocked secret door leads to area X19. The secret door can be found by any character who examines the wall and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. A character with the Stonecunning trait or proficiency with mason's tools has advantage on this check.

The secret door opens to reveal a dusty tunnel with another secret door at the far end of it. Characters inside the tunnel can find either secret door without needing to make an ability check.

***Trapdoor.*** The trapdoor leading to area X6 is secured with an *arcane lock* spell. As an action, a character can use thieves' tools to try to bypass the magical lock, doing so with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check, or the character can try to wrench open the trapdoor, doing so with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. A *knock* spell or similar magic also opens the trapdoor.

#### X22: Crypt of the Watched

>>A large burial chamber opens before you, divided in two by a central wall running north to south. Engraved stone caskets displayed throughout the crypt are draped in cobwebs.
>>
>>A weak voice breaks the silence. "Hush. Come no closer, or you'll wake the angry spirits."
>>

The stone caskets contain the earthly remains (dust and bones) of Xeluan's four companions and their loved ones.

***Angry Wraiths.*** If the characters ignore the warning and enter the crypt, four **wraiths** emerge from the caskets that line the central wall. The wraiths don't respond to verbal entreaties and can't leave the crypt, but they attack anyone who sets foot inside.

***Rilago's Ghost.*** The voice belongs to the **ghost** of Rilago. If the characters heed its warning and don't advance into the crypt, Rilago materializes in front of them and strikes up a conversation:

>>"My name is Rilago, and I am responsible for the unrest that besets Oztocan. My foolishness broke Xeluan's heart. I come to you eager to make amends. Together, we can save Oztocan from destruction."
>>

Rilago's ghost knows that only it can mend Xeluan's broken heart. If the characters present the *shard of Xeluan*, Rilago thanks the characters for returning the shard to Xeluan's tomb.

![Rilago's Ghost](img/adventure/KftGV/073-09-006.rilagos-ghost.webp)

The ghost describes the events chronicled in the "What Really Happened" section, then asks the characters to release the spirits of Xeluan's heroic companions. Edino trapped their spirits in chunks of oztocanite (see area X10), and Rilago knows how to release them: each oztocanite fragment must be brought in physical contact with the giant's petrified remains (in area X4). Physical contact with Xeluan reduces each oztocanite fragment to dust and frees the spirit trapped inside it. Freed spirits manifest as motes of spectral light that the petrified giant seems to absorb.

***Mending Xeluan's Broken Heart.*** Once the spirits of Xeluan's four companions are released from their oztocanite prisons, the characters can safely enter this crypt (the wraiths don't arise from their caskets) and reconvene with Rilago's ghost. The ghost reveals that it can mend Xeluan's heart only by possessing the body of a hero and using its host to place the *shard of Xeluan* where it belongs: with the rest of Xeluan's heart. The ghost then asks permission to possess one of the characters, leaving it up to the characters to decide which of them should become Rilago's temporary host.

Rilago's offer to mend the giant's heart is genuine. If the characters allow it, Rilago's ghost uses Possession against a willing character, who forgoes the saving throw to resist the effect. Only then can the ghost leave the crypt and return the *shard of Xeluan* to its rightful place. When Rilago's host touches the shard to the giant's heart, they bind as one. As the giant's heart is made whole again, Rilago's spirit is laid to rest, and the character ceases to be possessed.

## Conclusion

The story might conclude in one of the following ways, though other outcomes are possible:

- **Xeluan's Heart Is Mended** If Xeluan's heart is mended, the earthquakes stop. Peace returns to Oztocan. Rilago's redemption and the characters' heroism have strengthened the protective wards around Xeluan, rendering the giant impervious to further harm. No longer able to mine oztocanite from the giant, the Onyx Scar terminates its mining operation.
- **Xeluan's Heart Is Not Mended** If the characters fail to mend Xeluan's heart, the earthquakes worsen, forcing citizens of Oztocan to evacuate the town.

### For the Golden Vault

If the characters are working for the Golden Vault, the organization rewards the characters once the *shard of Xeluan* is returned to its rightful place. They receive a rare magic item of their choice (subject to your approval) as payment. The item is delivered to the characters the next day.

### What's Next?

The characters' adventures in Oztocan can continue long after Xeluan's heart is mended. The Onyx Scar might send assassins after the characters, or the syndicate's leaders might continue searching for other secrets hidden in Xeluan's tomb.
