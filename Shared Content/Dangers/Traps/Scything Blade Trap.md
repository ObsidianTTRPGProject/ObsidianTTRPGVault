# Scything Blade Trap
## Overview
*Simple trap (level 5–10, dangerous threat)*
This trap uses moving blades that sweep down through a chamber, threatening anyone nearby. Typically, a scything blade trap is activated by manipulating a lever or some other simple device. Kobolds especially like this kind of trap, since it can take down bigger creatures.

### Trigger.
When the lever is pulled, the trap activates.

### Effect.
Each Medium or larger creature in a 5-foot-wide, 20-foot-long area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Countermeasures.
The lever isn't hidden. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check involving the surfaces in the trap's area of effect reveals scrape marks and bloodstains on the walls and floor. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the lever.
