# Boros Legionnaire

As a member of the Boros Legion, your life is devoted to the service of angels and consecrated to the work of establishing justice and peace on the streets of Ravnica. You might be a true believer, inspired by the example of the angels, moved by the plight of the downtrodden, and devoted to the cause of justice. Or you could be a cynic in the ranks, perhaps because you reluctantly followed in the footsteps of a Boros parent, succumbed to the persuasion of a charismatic recruiter’s lofty promises, or were drawn in by the prospect of a life of action.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** Choose one of Celestial, Draconic, Goblin, or Minotaur
- **Equipment:** A Boros insignia, a feather from an angel’s wing, a tattered piece of a Boros banner (a souvenir from a famous battle), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 2 gp (Boros-minted 1-zino coins)

## Feature: Legion Station

You have an established place in the hierarchy of the Boros Legion. You can requisition simple equipment for temporary use, and you can gain access to any Boros garrison in Ravnica, where you can rest in safety and receive the attention of medics. You are also paid a salary of 1 gp (a Boros-minted 1-zino coin) per week, which (combined with free lodging in your garrison) enables you to maintain a poor lifestyle between adventures.

## Spell List

*Prerequisite:* Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature

For you, the spells on the Boros Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

| Spell Level | Spells                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Cantrip     | [[fire bolt]], [[sacred flame]]        |
| 1st         | [[guiding bolt]], [[heroism]]          |
| 2nd         | [[aid]], [[scorching ray]]             |
| 3rd         | [[beacon of hope]], [[blinding smite]] |
| 4th         | [[death ward]], [[wall of fire]]       |
| 5th         | [[flame strike]]                       |

Your magic often features dramatic bursts of flame or radiance. When you cast beneficial spells on your allies, they appear momentarily surrounded with halos of bright fire.

## Suggested Characteristics

The Boros Legion is a zealous army, full of righteous energy tempered with military discipline. Its members share its leadership’s devotion to the ideals of justice, or they find satisfaction in the more warfare-oriented aspects of the legion’s work.

### Contacts

The ordered structure of the Boros Legion offers abundant opportunities to make friends — and rivals — in higher places. You might have close friends in other guilds that share the Boros emphasis on order and community, or bitter enemies among the guilds that represent chaos and destruction.

Roll twice on the Boros Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Boros Contacts table.

^NoncontactRival

As a member of the Boros Legion, you are subject to the orders of your superior officers. You go where the angels tell you to go, and you do what they command you to do, to the best of your ability. If you enjoy some measure of independence, it’s either because you have proven yourself capable of working without close supervision or because you’re a rebellious sort who is willing to disobey orders now and face the consequences later.

As a soldier on the street, you are tasked with bringing dangerous threats like the Rakdos and the Gruul in line. You might contend with Rakdos performances gone horribly out of control, Gruul raids on outlying neighborhoods, shipments of rot-infested vegetation from the Golgari undercity, and violent uprisings among the guildless. At the same time, you might have to worry about Dimir spies infiltrating your leadership, overzealous or corrupt Azorius senators abusing the law at the expense of justice, Izzet experiments leveling city blocks, and Simic creations that break out of laboratories and wreak havoc through the Tenth District.
