## Feature: Spy Contact

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other spies. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.                                                              |
| 2   | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.                  |
| 3   | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden. |
| 4   | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.                                                                     |
| 5   | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.                                 |
| 6   | I don’t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.                                             |
| 7   | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can’t do it.                                                    |
| 8   | I blow up at the slightest insult.                                                                                     |

| 1   | Honor. I don’t steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)                                                                       |
| 2   | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)                                          |
| 3   | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)                                                   |
| 4   | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil)                                                                  |
| 5   | People. I’m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) |
| 6   | Redemption. There’s a spark of good in everyone. (Good)                                                                       |

| 1   | I’m trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.               |
| 2   | My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.                                    |
| 3   | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.              |
| 4   | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.                               |
| 5   | I’m guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.              |

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | When I see something valuable, I can’t think about anything but how to steal it.   |
| 2   | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money. |
| 3   | If there’s a plan, I’ll forget it. If I don’t forget it, I’ll ignore it.           |
| 4   | I have a “tell” that reveals when I’m lying.                                       |
| 5   | I turn tail and run when things look bad.                                          |
| 6   | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I’m okay with that.  |
